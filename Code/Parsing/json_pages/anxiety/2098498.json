It's stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: There's no worries. No worries. Just reminding you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: So, well, I'm here so that's good.

It's okay. It's kind of weird. I don't know. I'm like this I'm not really depressed or whatever. I'm just kind of anxious. But I think a lot of it is still that I'm anxious about good things, so that's good. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I mean the only thing that kind of sucks is just what I think you were saying yesterday, like I don't want to go to the other extreme of just going on a shitload of dates again. But it's like I just, I don't know. It's dating. I mean I guess just what everybody goes through, right? I mean it's you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">to connect with someone, but then you get tired of it, but then you want to connect with someone, but you're tired. It just is what it is. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I put up a very slim, but whatever back down, okay, keep it. I was like, fuck this. I'm not going to sit around, fuck that. So I mean I'm not taking it seriously, but I don't know. It's just weird, so weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: There's a difference maybe between going on a sleeping with people rampage that's kind of retaliation or condemnation somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yep. Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Versus getting through something and (overlapping voices) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Wanting some -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Wanting to settle down the next day after (overlapping voices) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: And I think there's something about just company. I mean, I work at home. I live alone. I'm a relatively young guy. I don't like what am I doing? I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: And yet in the mix of feelings, lots of different feelings about this relationship maybe coming to a close. And of course there are mixed feelings dating, or what are you looking for, but that's different than it being unconsciously getting back at her, getting back at her -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's the funny -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: or with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's the funny thing. There's nothing like that. I don't feel any of that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Or another way of thinking about is it could've once maybe been a retreat into one pole of your confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's the important thing. That's what I was going to say. When I was on when I got back on with K Stupid, I wasn't like it's just a normal sense of you check out some chicks. Well, why isn't this chick writing me back, whatever, but it's not there's no extreme of oh, I'm going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">to get all these chicks, or why isn't that one writing me back, and why isn't this one? I just don't care, in a good way. I already have a date for Saturday, whatever. I just don't... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right. Really different than now I'm going to get all of them so that I feel better about myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like you have to do that right now, and if -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: And I don't want to do that right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: You might not even want to, right.

Why am I not sleeping? I mean that's not good that I wasn't sleeping, but I wasn't in a panic about it. I like, you know what, I'm just up watching Fringe. I don't know. I was like, I'm anxious. My mind is just kind of I just don't feel that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">sleepy. It's not good but I try not to beat myself up for it. I don't know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Last night, it sounds like you take it all in stride. I still wonder when you say I couldn't sleep, what did you try to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I was anxious. No, I didn't even try to. My mind was just working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: So you didn't even put your head on the pillow, lights out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I had the lights out, but I was just laying in bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: The TV was on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: With my laptop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Oh, your laptop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's just a way to occupy my mind, and just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You always fall asleep with something on, right? No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: No, I've gotten a little bit better at when I feel tired because it's so easy, I'd just fold my laptop, put it on the table, and I'll just lay down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you didn't want to try that last night? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: For some reason, yeah, I just I don't know. Now other than mental stuff, I could also have been that I had too much coffee, because I had more than I usually have I'll have this and that's probably it, and I probably won't even finish that. But yesterday, I had three or four cups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I had one when I came here, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: And you said [OVERLAPPING VOICES] -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: I had half of that. I had half of that. I had a full well, I guess it wasn't really full because it was half hot water, but I had a Starbucks coffee. Then my uncle was at our house that was the other thing. My day wasn't very restful in a way. It was I was here, I was thinking about stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">My uncle was over and I hadn't seen him in a long time. I hadn't seen my grandmother, then we went to Panera. I had another coffee there, so what is that? Three, right. That, I rushed from there to practice, and I got one of these, and I drank the whole thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Hm. So that's an interesting question, though, so why? And it's not typical for you to have four coffees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Just because there's all this stuff. It wasn't like my usual routine, and it was fucking freezing. And I also do I mean I'm weird. I kind of do it's like a I'm like my dad that way, or my dad's side of the family. It's just coffee's always around. I don't finish it or whatever. It's like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">a cigarette or if you chew on your pen or something. But yet, it was so fucking cold that I ended up drinking all of it. Or it's like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: So how about a decaf?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: I can't stand decaf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Just have tea. Yeah. It tastes burnt and weird. Yeah, I don't know. I just don't like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: So how about tea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Tea's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Hot chocolate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Eh, hot chocolate's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: It's not good for you to have four cups of coffee where it keeps you up all night, that's all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, no shit. That's very true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And even as it was happening, I was like, oh, this is clearly too much coffee. It's not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Your body responds. I mean you said that before, a couple times you had a lot of coffee that day, and you stay up the whole night.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098498\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yep, yep, yep. Yep. I always am kind of like, whatever. It was like, no, but when you have that much, it's it's one thing if I have this, and then let's say if I go to the Guys at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., so all I've had is half of this, and I'll get another one, and I'll kind of just toy with it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">that's fine. But Starbucks, Panera, these fucking idiots with their disgusting coffee, that's so there was that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: That (inaudible at 08:44). [LAUGHING]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, that plus the day was full of activity. My family, I love them but they were stressful to be with them. And then practice and we drank after practice. There's alcohol, too. I mean, we didn't drink drink, but I had two beers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">Plus, yeah, there's just a lot. I'm trying to get this record out. I'm trying to find someone new to do the graphic design. I had to call BMI to figure out my publishing stuff, and how to yeah. I'm just and the money's not enough. I might be in a little bit of a bind, so there's that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: From Kickstart, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just didn't count on this graphic design fiasco. And also, for whatever reason, I don't know why but I didn't know that there's a fee for BMI. Because I'm already a member, but I didn't take into account that I'm starting a new publishing because I'm releasing it myself, so I think there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">a fee for that. I think it's $200 or $300 bucks. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">It's just all this shit. It's not a huge deal, and I but it's just stuff that makes my mind kind of... (pause) I'm putting together the show in March.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well, there's enough on your mind like a day like yesterday where it's, it's a day where it would be particularly helpful for you not to drink so much coffee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: I know. I had thought of that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And even have an Ambien on a night if you know your mind is racing, if that would -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: That was the weird thing. I don't know why I didn't do did I do that last night? I didn't do that. I've kind of been doing that lately just to have at least be like, okay, if I'm not going to fall asleep by midnight or 1:00, I could at least be asleep by 2:00. I mean, I got to somehow so I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: An hour of sleep is not good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, no. Well, this was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 10:59).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well, this was unusual.

No, I've been getting more than four, so I've been better. But yeah, for whatever reason yesterday. Did I? I don't think I did. I don't think I had an Ambien. I don't know why. I think when I got home, I was just up, and I was like, all right, that's okay. I'm just up for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">now.

The staying up at night has been a retreat for you, too, and if there's a lot of feeling going on yesterday, maybe there's a part of you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">just longing for an excuse to stay up, and get cozy, and be near your computer and a show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, although I wasn't that cozy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: I think because of the coffee.

But you're right. I mean I get what you're saying, though. You're right. I don't know. It's just a bummer. Then there's this other thing, of all it's the stuff that just makes me sad because it makes me a little doom and gloom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">Of all things, I found this Assyrian chick, on OK Stupid, and she's fucking she's an opera singer. She's beautiful. But already, I just get the sense that it's just not going to happen, and stuff like that's just fucking bumming me out. It's like it's bad enough I have a bad track record in general <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">with relationships, I cannot get an Assyrian chick that I'm interested in to reciprocate. I can't make it happen. I just can't. I'm like, what's the problem here? Age-wise, perfect. Our background, she's very cosmopolitan, she's artistic, I'm like, what's the problem? And yet, it's just not I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD2\">sense it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">She's a little I friended her on Facebook. She's like, \"I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I don't really friend people on Facebook.\" She's like, \"You can like my fan page.\" Get the fuck out of here, like your fan page? You like my fan page, idiot. I was like, what the fuck are you talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">about? It's like, you're on OK Stupid, but you want people to like you don't want to friend them on Facebook? It's like, what am I, a freak? I'm a nice dude who has your background. I don't know, man. See, stuff like that just I don't know. It's fucking tiring, and it's a bummer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It sounds like she thought you were a fan or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: That was the thing. There's no inkling that I'd be a fan. I mean we were just chatting. We chatted on OK Stupid. We -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Oh, you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't randomly -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Okay. I thought that was the first contact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: No, no, no. We chatted on so I was just like, this is stupid to be on this. Now we've chatted and let's move it to a not that Facebook is great, but you know. So I was just like, whatever. It just I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You've alluded to, before, to feeling like the kind of Assyrian woman you'd be attractive to is attracted to American, very, very Americanized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Or whatever, yeah. Or they're going to end up with an Assyrian, but it's probably going to be not it's probably going to be a douche. This girl's in other words, they go through this it could even be a long phase they're all artsy, and this and that. They're living in New York, downtown, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">whatever, but really when it comes time for them to get serious, they just pick some douche bag, some fucking banker, or something, and that's that. He's Assyrian, but he's really just a douche. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">So that happens a lot. They act all artsy, and oh, I got a painting, or whatever the fuck, but really they're just little princesses and they're just going to marry some idiot. It's very rare that they stick with that and actually get together with a non-Assyrian but at least who's cool, or usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D11\">it's not like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: So when you say some idiot and some douche, you mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: Cookie cutter -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: moving back to a conservative -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: old school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Total square. A total fucking square, yep. An engineer or a finance guy, or whatever. So yeah. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098498\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">And I think on top of everything else, being with my family for that long was just, ugh. Even thinking about it now just makes me feel tight and wound up. It's just like, they're just everything's just fucking heavy. Even when they try to be light, it's so forced. My uncle's like this now, and yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">It's just everything's just stressed. Just a conversation is stressful. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">And then I was like, I think yesterday or last night, or the day before, I don't know, I think maybe because of all this stuff, I started getting the physical stuff. Not so much that I feel I mean I definitely feel a little tight and anxious off and on, but I started having this dread, and I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">I just cannot relax. I was like, that's making me panic now. Even now when I said it, I feel the anxiety. It's bothering me that I can't I often times give a fa\u00e7ade of being very calm, and I guess a lot of times I am calm. But, I don't know, in general, I feel like I'm not relaxed enough. I'm just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E12\">constantly going and, I don't know. It makes me nervous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Do you mean you're sort of afraid that you're feeling that right now, today and yesterday, or you start feeling paranoid that you've always never been able to relax? Is it a bigger -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: In general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: sort of thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, in general. But yeah, especially I've been thinking about it the last few days, yeah. I mean again, it could be the coffee as well, but I don't know. I just worry that I even when I'm home, am I really relaxing? I mean, thank god for the cat. But I got to just get back to I mean, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">was good for a week there with exercise stuff. I just got to get back to that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: There's an incredible amount of stress, and tension, and anxiety, and trauma that causes anxiety in your history, Brian. I mean I think you carry around so much tension of all that's ever been inside you in a physical way, and then sometimes you get anxious about noticing those symptoms when <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">those symptoms -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Like today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It just makes some sense that you're on guard and we were talking about PTSD. That's part of a hyper-vigilant tense preparedness for something bad happening is part of that range of symptoms, and it literally has a bodily component.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, then I freak out because of family history, or my dad, or whatever. Just illness, or whatever the then I start freaking out. And then of course, that's a vicious cycle because you can't relax if you're like, you've got to relax. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That never works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: So especially if you don't relax, you're going to get sick. It's just that's not helpful. So I think other than this, I think it really has to be exercise, or maybe actual meditation, like going somewhere with people, or someone to just like I come here. Just because it's not at home, that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F51\">not really sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. It's not structured. It's not -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Well, you also don't have built up inside you really soothing healthfully soothing figures just living inside you from your childhood. I picture your dad, and you loved him and idealized him in many ways, but also the image of handling things is clamping down stoicism. Smoking a cigarette <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F71\">and having a drink, which actually really isn't that helpful for his health. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098498\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">That's the thing that might is going to be harmful, in addition to the stressfulness. Your mother is smothering with do this, do this, do this, do this, making it even worse with her own anxiety about how on earth did you get sick, or why us, or how did this happen? They're both handling anxiety in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">pretty unhealthy ways, so there's no one soothing inside. Just telling you it's going to be okay, or let's have less coffee tomorrow. That would be helpful. And go get to the gym or something. But just kind of good self-care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Even my posture, it just bothers me. I try to do it myself, but I'm like, maybe I need somebody to fucking realign my spine, or just help me like when we play, I catch myself in the middle of a song or whatever, and I can tell I'm like this. Some of that is just my stance. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">like to lean a little bit into the microphone, but still, I'm just not I just don't like that. So stuff like that. It's like all these little things add up. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: What are things that are ordinary but I think sometimes make you feel like you're alone, the only one dealing with this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true, too. See, yeah, that's the other thing, too. I can't even what am I talking about? First of all, people have way more stress than what is my stress? I fucking work from home. I come here. I try to remind myself of that, but that's how I know I have to do something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF1\">it. What's going on? I mean, I don't know, or maybe I'm being extreme. There have been a lot of days maybe I'm saying all this now just this week <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Because you feel that way today and yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: There are plenty of days I go to Starbucks, I'm totally chilled out. I just have one half cup of coffee. I sit there for a few hours, I do my I feel fine. I come home. I do have a routine. Yeah, I think you're right. When this kind of stuff happens, even though I feel so much better, I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201071\">do feel, I guess, kind of alone, and maybe that's like my mom's side. Then I start to cook, and oh, I'm having too much coffee. It's like, what? It's like the one time I had such a bad panic attack, one of the last times I went to the ER. There's this very she was a doctor, I think. She was a young <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201072\">doctor. She was a cool chick, whatever. And I don't know what I said, something about oh, I was like, I'm getting these chronic headaches. She's like, \"Oh.\" She's like, \"I wake up with a chronic headache every single I take five Advil a day.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">And so yeah, there's like the fact that I'm actually, in some ways, probably doing way better than but again, yeah, I think with that stuff, it's all on my mother's side. It's all this very I just worry and I get little things become big things that are just fucking ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: It is true that having less coffee will probably help you, but it's also true that it's not a huge deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: It's not yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: You did that yesterday. Of course you're feeling stressed out yesterday, Brian, and today. And you actually haven't been feeling this way for a lot of the time lately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Right, right. And the fact is it isn't even that bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20110-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20110-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098498\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: No. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Yesterday was a fine day. I went to practice, had a great practice. Hung out with the guys. Yeah. I think it's just the mechanism is kicking in, like, oh, something happened with a girl or whatever. Now we've got to get wacky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Even though part you're not even believing that. There's those two minds going on about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: Right, right. Well, even though I don't think I want to be with her pretty much, so I think there's just that hardwired thing that's much less, but it's still trying to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: The hardwired thing is that it's you, and you're the one who's rejectable. Even though I know you know that's not the story, but that's part of the idea of being back alone is oh, I'm never going to be with anybody, and it's just me and there must be something about me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, deep down, I think there is, yeah. There's that. And I think, again, it doesn't help having this Assyrian element. I think if I was just completely Americanized, I'm in the same boat as everybody else. We're all trying to find somebody. I think I'd but that added element of it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">almost like being rejected by two different groups. Instead of just one I'm America, everybody's American, whatever. There's no but this feels like I'm being deep down, there's that doom and gloom that I can't figure it out with either side of this cultural thing. Which again, I know is completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D2\">catastrophizing, and whatever, but yeah, deep down, it does feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Like you're not going to ever fit anywhere or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yep. Or that I missed the boat somehow. I'm young, but I'm not young enough for girls that might be really cool, but they're 24 or 25. Or there might be women who are 40 who are really cool, but I'd like to have kids, and I'd like somehow there's yeah. Which again is neither here nor <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">there. I mean I don't know what that means. There's all kinds of people all different ages, but yeah, it's just it's really my mom's side for sure. When I get like this, it's as if what ways can I find to be down on myself and ignore all the awesome things that are happening.

Letters?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: Handwritten letters?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: Handwritten letters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Oh, my goodness. So how'd you find her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: She found me because a friend of mine told her, \"Hey, I got this friend who's a poet. You're a poet. You guys are around the same age.\" And then she was like, \"Oh, I know that name.\" And she had read my stuff in the paper, whatever, and got my number and called me. It was awesome. I think if <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D1\">things had been different, it would've gone differently, but because I put her on a pedestal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">I mean I was fucked. I was so fucked up. It was never going to work, but yeah. So it was awful. I mean I was having the panic attacks and then not telling anybody. I was going to the emergency room. Oh, man, my mom was sleeping on the floor in the den because she wasn't sleeping in the bedroom. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F1\">is only five months after my dad died. I'd hold it in, hold it in, hold it in, then I'd break down. It was a fucking nightmare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: Break down with your mother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Sobbing, you mean? Or having a panic attack?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: Well, both. Yeah. It was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">THERAPIST: What would you do when you would?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">CLIENT: Well, she'd cry. She'd console me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: It was helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: I don't remember. Yeah, I'm sure it was. My mom isn't at the end of the day, my mom is she isn't the type of person to castigate someone when she really sees I mean she's not like that. But I think the thing is that wasn't the help I needed. I mean I needed to be here and have medication, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F1\">and someone to really take charge and be like, \"Look, you've got to finish school,\" or whatever. \"Let's get you some help.\" That's what I needed, but instead, they were like, \"See ya.\" I mean they weren't like see ya, but there was no real no one called me out. No one called me out. Anyway. But yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: What just happened? Why'd you say anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: Well, I don't know. It's such a long fucking story, I don't even it's an endless story. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">I think that's the other thing that makes me tired and kind of sad about relationships is I feel like I can't explain. If I just stop objectively make a list, even just a list of stuff I've gone through, things I've done, places I've been, blah, blah, blah, whatever. It's kind of unreal. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201751\">I'm not better than other people. I just feel like for a 40 year old, it's like what the fuck. That's a lot of life. Because I've been the type where I'm proactive, even if I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm like fuck it, I'm moving to OREGON Fuck it, I'm moving to Europe. I'm very I feel like sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201752\">maybe that makes me feel more alone, because I'm like, where do I how do I really, I don't know. I don't know if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Well, one of the questions you're asking is you're starting to talk about just a little bit is how much of it is running away from something, and how much do you then feel alone as you're on a road trip, heading out to Oregon or to Arizona, and what you really need is to feel in company and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201771\">together, and taking care of is somebody to stand with you and say, \"Here, don't run away. You need some help. Let's get you some treatment. Let's get you back in school.\" It's hard to know how much has been running from something. When you say I'm the type that I'm proactive and you go places, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201772\">don't always know exactly why though. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20176-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20176-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098498\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: Right. Right, right. Well, I mean yeah, Oregon, that's almost like I blacked out almost. I don't know what was going on there, but other things, I mean, I think there is a somewhat I think in that way, I'm an artist. I'm like, no. You know what? This is scary or whatever, but I'm going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201791\">Europe. So I think generally, it's been good intentions, but I think maybe not thought out completely because of other issues that I hadn't sorted out. But yeah, you're right. It's kind of like, what's going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Or there's a courage to go, but there's not a framework for thinking also about what you're leaving behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">CLIENT: That's right. That's right. That's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">THERAPIST: And then what needs to be done to make going feel really good and possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">CLIENT: Right. Right, right. Well, and also it's just simple. At the end of the day, if you have emotional or mental issues, they're just going to get in your way whatever you do. As good intention, or courageous, or you have a purpose or whatever, but then that purpose gets fucked up because you can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201811\">concentrate, or you can't so there's all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">But yeah, that's why I thought, you know what, that has to be the novel, in a way. All this stems from that. I mean, not the old Brian, but this feeling like no one's giving me guidance. I mean, it all started, that was the moment. That could've changed everything, and it kind of set the tone for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201831\">20 years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">And I think that's lately, I'm not trying to put a good spin on it, it's just because I genuinely feel it, I think I'm also sometimes staying up because really I should be at my desk writing. My mind, it's there. I can feel it, just like with the first book. It's time. But I think with this, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201851\">more scared because even talking about it, it makes me feel uncomfortable and anxious. So to write a novel about it, you got to lose yourself in that, and that's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">THERAPIST: I'm struck even when you said so anyway, it was like enough of that. Do you know what even about thinking about a road trip, what feels so uncomfortable -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">CLIENT: Oh, it was a fucking nightmare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">THERAPIST: to even bring that up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">CLIENT: It was, I mean, what doesn't feel I mean it was a fucking nightmare. The first night in the middle of nowhere, I don't know, wherever the fuck I was, having a complete panic attack in a fucking hotel room when you're 19 or 20. I mean, that's just one example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Sad and scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah. But not having the [where with all] (ph) to be like, I don't want to do this, I want to go back home, fucking carrying on across the country. I don't know who that person was. Those memories are just very strange, strange memories. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20190-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20190-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098498\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">THERAPIST: What did you tell your family was why you were going, for this girl?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">CLIENT: Her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">THERAPIST: So they knew that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">THERAPIST: And how'd they respond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">CLIENT: Honestly, the only thing that gives me some I mean I've got to be empathetic to them. I mean, it was just a few months after I mean they were I think I underestimating here a little bit how beyond profoundly stunned my family was, to the core. They were in a daze, too. They were in a daze. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D1\">When I look back on it, I don't know what the fuck they said. They didn't know what they said. They were concerned. There was a lot of talk about because I was, I think, even saying it, I was like, well, you know, if it doesn't work out, I'll just come back. I mean that was the other thing. Go if <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D2\">you're going to go, but four years? Why? It was a nightmare from beginning to end, literally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">I mean, whatever decent moments there were, were not that decent. What is that? I could've just gone. It's an adventure. I'm 18, 19, that's the stuff that really unsettles me. I'm really uncomfortable with that. I'm like, what was that? It was as if I was a baby, and I'm in a growing man's body. I look <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F1\">around me and other 18, 19, 20 year olds, they go through a lot of bad things, but somehow they have this there's something about them. They seem to have a sense of I'm fucked up, or this or that, but I'm working two jobs, and I'm going to try to get myself through school, and they're fucked up but <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F2\">somehow, there's something that I don't know what to say about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">That's the other reason I thought of the I was like, something happened. Something, I was already shy. I was already whatever, but I wasn't that I would sit there, I would write at my desk. I've told you those stories. I would send shit out all the time to the fucking New Yorker and this. I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A11\">confidence at 17 years old, sending shit out. I wanted to go to the news school, or Bennington. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">THERAPIST: You graduated early.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I graduated early. There was a I think if all this shit hadn't happened, I was one of those kids like my background's weird or whatever, but I was going to make it work. I mean, you could never know, but I think more or less, I was going to make it work. I was ambitious, and I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A51\">but something clearly... Well, I don't know what it's like to be under mortar attack all of a sudden, but I don't know how else to explain it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Then it really feels like your father's death hit as a total trauma.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And not just me, to the whole family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">THERAPIST: To the whole family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Yep, yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">THERAPIST: So not only are you getting derailed and they're getting derailed, but then because they're derailed, you can't even be helped with your own state. There's no one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">CLIENT: No. I mean, they weren't cold to me or anything like that.

When I asked how they responded to your saying you were going across the country, it wasn't even from a place of judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, no, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">THERAPIST: I didn't know if they could say, \"Oh, no, please don't go,\" and beg you to stay because they need you.

We'll support -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">THERAPIST: That's good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Poor kid. Let him go, I don't know. Because they're not the type to just be like, all right. See you later. They're not like that. There is a lot of love, but just it was just shellshock.
