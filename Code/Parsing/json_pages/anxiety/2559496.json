Hi, come on in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(Pause): [00:00:06 00:00:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: We stopped at an interesting place on Monday. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(Pause): [00:00:55 00:01:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Whether I thought what was expecting of being with Chris versus what he expected of me? Was it something like that or I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: What you imagine he expects of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I've been thinking on this stuff for a while now and like, just is he right for me? Is he right for me? (Laughs) It just keeps going on, that same kind of question. So I don't know. Yesterday, I had to submit a draft of what I recommend. I wasn't very happy with it. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">thinking it was because I've been so busy with this new initiative we've started and all that. Now, I'm like all scared and I'm like, 'oh, God, I'm not paying enough attention to my work,' which is the top priority for me. Should I just drop everything, all my commitments and I don't know. I get scared. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">It's just the wrong feelings with this. I keep thinking he will say like, 'this is not experimental enough,' or he's too cut and dry, you know. Methodical and it's not the right but then I'm like, I can make my own kind of, I can influence myself, like I don't have to look to him for anything. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(Pause): [00:03:22 [00:03:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: At school it was much better I think because then last week I was really, really tense. I think that was because of my fight with this woman in there. So I just couldn't take it and last week I e-mailed her, a very long e-mail like because she like blocked me on Facebook. We're still friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">but I couldn't see any of her posts so I just wrote her like, 'I know what this is. Like, I helped you so much last semester and this and that and we should really talk this out and then she wrote back and apologized and you know, you'd said something that sounded very mean and so I put some distance <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">between us and so we talked it out over e-mail and yesterday at school we keep running into each other. We were in class together and outside we talked and I felt so light. (Laughs) Like calm. But I was just thinking like when last week when I was so tense, I said to Chris, and Chris said, 'why do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">even bother with her? She strikes me as totally a waste of time.' I'm like, 'why did you say that?' I'm very shocked that he said that because I really liked her and invited her home and I'd been to her place and I didn't care that she doesn't quite fit in to my agenda. I don't even have an agenda. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">Maybe that's why I'm floundering. (Laughs) But I didn't really have like okay I should talk to these people and I should seek out these people and those other people are out. You know, like they are not better than me at all. I just don't think that way at all and I guess Chris does. So he says, 'just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">don't waste your time with her. Just ignore her.' And I said, 'okay, I'll try to do it like you. I don't know how you do it,' but I couldn't. I just like carry around her and I have to talk it out and if I get mad I have to yell and scream at the person and thankfully it worked out. It doesn't work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">out all the time that you can resolve the situation, but so that made me think like is this beneficial for me to be with someone who is so structured and like I keep thinking it's going to make me a better person and I'm really sure now what I mean by that. I didn't really define like, 'okay, does <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D7\">that mean this, this, and this area?' But I can take off the others. I don't know. They had to be political, how to what books to read and stuff. I thought maybe, but now I kind of can figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559496\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">(Pause): [00:07:09 00:07:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I'm trying to do things that I (unclear) do like go to open mic things and have more poetry and more art as much as politics but I don't go to his colleagues' place and so then it would just be a bunch of (unclear) people and maybe I am wrong to shut that experience out but I've done that and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">I found it to be dry for me. I didn't really contribute much there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">(Pause): [00:08:10 00:08:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: What are you feeling as you're talking about this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I don't know. What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: There's this way in which you just seem to (unclear) like (Sighs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: (Laughs) About what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: About what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: About Chris? Well, anything can make you say (Laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">(Pause): [00:08:40 00:08:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Everything should? Or but this (unclear) you're saying I should be excited about why are you surprised about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: It just seems like you're I don't know, kind of like dismissive like, 'oh, whatever.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that's surprising to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: No. I just thought it was no I just thought it was worthy of comment. Did it make you anxious that I commented on that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, I just thought, you know like this question that I've been trying to answer like is Chris right for me I thought maybe this was a cue that I was wondering if this was significant enough to help me answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(Pause): [00:09:26 00:09:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well the way you talk about your relationship in here, he's less of a companion than kind of a model for how you should live or resist living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Resist living?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: You know like, I could do this but I'm not going to. You know. I try to say just forget it, write her off, but I can't do that. So that's the resistance to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: He may feel like a companion but you don't describe him in here like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. I suppose it seems more interesting to talk about him as the other part rather than companion we (unclear) about him being a companion. I don't know. We sit around and talk. (Laughs) We cook together. That's not really very interesting. I mean, that's not a source of anxiety, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">I guess. Because the mode of this thing I assume he wants to talk about makes me anxious or he's just naturally doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I mean that's part of being a companion for sure, but it seems like everything that he says to you, for you is loaded about what you should or shouldn't do. It's not really about sharing experiences with each other or this is what it was like for me. It's about directives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know why that is the case. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">(Pause): [00:11:51 00:12:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I wonder how long it's been that way. Maybe just since last year, it's been like okay I have to better myself to be like, to be worthy of him or to be his equal and like I don't feel his equal because I'm still a student and he's a professor and you can't get a new start from that. (Laughs) Like yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559496\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I don't know. Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I was thinking if one person is a lawyer and the other person is a medical student, to like, one's a student and one's an attorney. They're doing different things. You're doing different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">(Pause): [00:13:10 00:13:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I just wonder how much difference is encouraged actually in our relationship. Maybe I've got the sense that it's not. You know like it's not something that is articulated but it's like it's something you sense. You've just got to guess the kind of people he admires or talks about or hangs <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">out or speaks highly of. You just get a sense that okay, so you know, like that would be ideal and I'm not the sort of person who doesn't think they're his ideal. You know, like just be, why does everything have to have a meaning can go in that way because yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well, you serve complementary roles in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: What he brings to the table is different, like you're bringing to this table looking for guidance and a way to live. He brings to the table wanting to give you that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: So you mean if I'd brought something else to the table he would bring something else to it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: I don't know that. I don't know if at some point if you'd outgrown this relationship or that this relationship could grow. Which I think is a (unclear) one of the few reasons that I think couple's therapy could be helpful for you. I don't know that piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it's not growing right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: No. It's not. It really isn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because we do, we're not committing and stuff for -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Because your dynamic is so centered around this student\/teacher and winning his approval and feeling that you have to do things his way or resist doing things his way and I'm sure he plays a part in that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(Pause): [00:16:18 00:16:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: But it's not about being adult companions. Maybe you wouldn't want that but I think you'd be happier that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Having an adult companion. At some point I think you need this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">Chris serves a need for you at this point but from my vantage point it's a need I hope you outgrow to some extent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">(Pause): [00:16:47 00:16:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: It's funny like when I think well okay I won't seek his approval then all I'm thinking of is resistance like when I think I'll do this, I'll do that, it's like in the back of my head I'm not saying that's the motivation for doing that sort of thing but one thought really is 'well, Chris will <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">have to know, like this is not what Chris would pick. But he comes like, like some of those things he comes. So is he being a good companion, then? (Laughs) Are we growing (unclear)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It's so interesting because I gave you you're asking for cues and I gave you such a direct response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Such a direct response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: I couldn't have been more direct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">(Pause): [00:18:04 00:18:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Did you not hear that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: No. I did. You know, it's just kind of like then we have to probe that malady, slap the thing on that's stable. I have to, like a cat, go around it. (Laughs) Inspect it. (Laughs) I think I don't know how quickly he'll sort of outgrow because I definitely feel needy or like my need for direction <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">is so intense. I really, absolutely feel lost without it. You know, all the things we talked about several times I'm sure. I just feel like the thing that I'm doing is so like directionless, so like maybe it's just my perception of it but until you get sort of like a decent break, a (unclear) break, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F2\">you feel, you really define yourself by not yet. You're not there yet. I mean you don't have to but I guess I did and makes you like inadequate to be with anyone, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559496\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">(Pause): [00:19:59 00:20:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: You feel like as an adult companion I just cannot bring it to the table.

You've sort of identified different things while you were a student. A lot of students are married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: They're in relationships.

How dare you not to? You owe me. So that kind of device is very, very damaging for everyone. And (unclear) is not a child.

People could be friends even like you said the other day. People are friends for the longest time and they still don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201971\">know the particulars about the other person's job and you know and major chunks of life can be hidden and that's quite usual and normal also.
