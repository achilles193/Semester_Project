I feel like a lot has happened since the last time I was here. My sister got engaged over the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: My goodness. That\u2019s great news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it was funny because her fianc\u00e9 \u2013 I\u2019ve got to get used to saying that \u2013 wanted to ask my parents for their blessing a week ago and that was when Todd and I were driving up to drop off Trae so they could watch him for the night and we were headed to Bar Harbor. And as soon as we rounded <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">the corner and saw his car in the driveway we were like, \u2018oh!\u2019 And he knew we were going out so we really didn\u2019t intrude on anything but then we got to be in on the secret too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: So you knew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, but for a whole week so it was so hard \u2013 I purposely did not see them all week and when we were up there with my parents when he first asked for their blessing we were joking with Trae, saying now he calls Matt \u201cMeep\u201d, but now you have to call him \u201cUncle Meep, Uncle Meep.\u201d And so he started <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">saying that and we got home and we said, \u2018great \u2013 now Helen can\u2019t see Trae all week either, like he\u2019s totally going to blow it.\u2019 So it was like so hard to keep the secret and she ended up popping over on Friday night and this all happened on Saturday when he proposed. So it was like so hard to keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">it from her and Trae did say. \u201cUncle Meep\u201d while she was there, but we were both kind of like covering it, yeah. But it\u2019s fun now to have like this big, exciting thing to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, something positive to look forward to (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I think it will be great and my parents are like so excited, too, and I think it\u2019s nice just thinking about my mom, too, now that we have this big, happy exciting thing to be focused on is nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just a nice reminder too, of \u2013 you\u2019ve had a lot of big events that have highlighted the support that is available in your family, but it\u2019s nice to have a positive support where you also get to lean on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: A reminder sort of the cycle of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I think it will be good. I notice myself like thinking about my grandmother so much. And just thinking about like when Todd and I got engaged and like our two first calls after we talked to our immediate family was calling, both of my grandmothers and Todd\u2019s grandmother and it was just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">that \u2013 so Helen called me and like my stepdad\u2019s mom and then it was just like that like there\u2019s this \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Little void that you can\u2019t share with your other grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. And knowing like that my mom, the first call that she would make would be to talk to her too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So there is a piece that is missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But happy in so many ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Right. I think it will be great. And it\u2019s fun \u2013 like she lives just down the road from us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: So you get to be as involved as you want probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Exactly. I think she\u2019s going to want me to be a little more involved because she doesn\u2019t really see herself as an organizer and definitely sees me as like the planner and organizer which I think is pretty accurate. So it will be funny to see like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: You could help her hire a professional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: If we didn\u2019t have Trae and life wasn\u2019t so busy I\u2019d be ready to take that on. I think I\u2019ll just \u2013 there are little things I\u2019m just so excited to help her with and then maybe I\u2019ll (cross talk) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: To a professional?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Exactly. I think that will be good. So it\u2019s been such a relief now to just have it open like being just \u2013 we were joking the whole time like so worried that we were going to say something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: And ruin his moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know. And so, it wasn\u2019t. It was perfect and she was totally surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it will be really fun. So we had that exciting news and then Todd and I had such a nice time in Bar Harbor, too. So it was so \u2013 and it was funny because I think when I was here the last time it was so hard for me to leave Trae the first time and now I\u2019m not feeling much sadness <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">at all. I\u2019m feeling so ready and I definitely felt that way and then like the Friday before we left I was like, \u2018oh I\u2019m just going to miss him.\u2019 Like that twinge kind of feeling you get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You were surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s funny \u2013 it\u2019s like Todd and I would always joke too. Whenever Todd goes away for like long periods of time I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ll just cry when I\u2019m saying good-bye to him. I just can\u2019t help it. And he same thing \u2013 like I didn\u2019t do it in front of Trae because I didn\u2019t want him to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">be wondering, but I guess not really. I was kind of far away in the driveway. I was kind of laughing through it but it\u2019s just so funny that that \u2013 I don\u2019t know, but the saying good-bye piece is always so hard for me. And as soon as we left \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re you anxious? Because I know when Todd goes away you sometimes talk about feeling a little bit anxious about just being on your own, or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wasn\u2019t feeling anxious at all. I think just sad to leave him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting how complex the feelings can be and how you can be sort of excited and looking forward to having time as an adult independent person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: And also sad at the same time as a parent because you\u2019re sad to leave him even though you\u2019re looking forward to spending time alone with Todd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: And Todd was kind of laughing. Like we were in the car kind of driving away and I\u2019m just sitting there like crying and we started talking about Helen getting engaged and then I was like but then we can\u2019t call (unclear) and then I\u2019d start crying because I felt like this is really awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: This is a great weekend away with my wife. But then yeah, but then I totally \u2013 was fine but it was funny because I was kind of \u2013 as we were driving to drop him off, I thought oh, I think I\u2019m a little more sad than I thought. But then it all was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: You were able to go through it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Right, and checking it. And it\u2019s nice that like worrying about him, I\u2019m not at all. Like my mom is with him every week. She knows all of his little (cross talk) likes and dislikes and everything. So it\u2019s nice. There wasn\u2019t like a shred of me that was worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Just that he would be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So I think it\u2019s good though. Because I know like I think that Todd\u2019s parents may have gone away more often and that was like more a part of his growing up because it was more like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: More like normal for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: His parents to have their time alone and I think that is like important to him and it is important to me too to have that time but for me, like my parents never left. Like I can remember like one weekend maybe when they left. So that just wasn\u2019t a part of my growing up. We would go lots of places, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">but we would go as a family pretty much or we would do like away like the girls would do like father and daughter weekend and things like that, but I can\u2019t remember except for one time I remember my parents leaving myself and Helen home. It will be interesting to see how that goes forward because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">know it is important to Todd to just be like he can get away even if it is just an overnight and we can have that time together. And it feels like that too but like there\u2019s part of me too that really wants it and another part of me that, \u2018well, maybe I don\u2019t want that all the time.\u2019 Like we can bring <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200713\">Trae with us for half the time, whatever. So I think it will be interesting to see how that plays out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: What you decide is sort of the right formula?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: It might look different than what Todd may have had or what you had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. And I don\u2019t think Todd\u2019s parents were really going off all the time on these crazy vacations but I do think it was just like a little bit more normal for them to do something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s lots of different ways to raise a family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I think the more we do \u2013 even just the little overnights, because I think it is starting to feel a little more comfortable. It definitely was easier to leave him than the first time so that\u2019s like a good little \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And it sounds like it was successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes, it was really nice. We just ate and drank like the entire time. There are so many great restaurants in Bar Harbor and it was so fun. So yeah, we definitely had a good time, too. And it was nice to just \u2013 I felt like we had just such a nice long stretch of not having any time together, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean you had all these plans that had to get pushed back for different events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: So it had been a long time that you\u2019d been planning to go out and have \u2013Whether it would be your birthday or his birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know we\u2019d been joking around \u2013 like we\u2019re probably on this list of like people not to let make appointments at the place \u2013 like we were planning on getting massages and cancelled so many times and (unclear) we\u2019re going to be going down to Arizona to visit Todd\u2019s parents next weekend. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">And last year when we did that we went on a couple of little day nights once Trae was asleep or whatever before because all the restaurant close so early \u2013 so we did leave early before he was asleep but it was nice to like \u2013 I feel we\u2019ll have a few more little (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: By yourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that will be good. And then I just feel like school, now that this semester has started and everything \u2013 it definitely does feel busier and I feel myself like \u2013 Fridays now has become like my day for TF\u2019ing and so we have our teaching team meeting from 9 to usually 10:30 or 11, so far. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">This is only the second week. Or this is the third week so we haven\u2019t quite figured out the routine but we meet in the morning and then it feels like we have this mad dash to get everything ready and then class meets at 1 from 1 \u2018til 4. And so I just notice that the first day of class it just felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D2\">there was so much adrenalin like trying to get everything ready and David works like such in a different way than I do then everything is last minute. Like even to have a teaching team meeting on the day of class doesn\u2019t really make sense, but he\u2019s only on campus for one day so that\u2019s kind of how we <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D3\">have to do it. But I felt like there was this scramble and then like being so focused in class and being on in class and by the end of the day it was just like emotionally draining. And in between on that first day, in between on that first day, I had like this deadline to submit a little proposal for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D4\">a conference at school. So there were other things to do too and it felt like there was all this energy and it was hard to like let go at the end of class. Like I came home and felt like, noticing myself thinking like back to little things from like last year, like what was I saying at the end of class <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D5\">and was the video recording still going and how did I introduce this one thing and did I say it in a way that worked for every student. Like letting myself hash over the class like almost trying to find things to worry about. And so last week was much better just because it didn\u2019t feel like that. In <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D6\">between time there wasn\u2019t that much to do. But that\u2019s just one thing I noticed that it feels like now Fridays are my high energy, stressful day just to get everything \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: How do you wind down after class?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know that I have \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: What do you do between classes going home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t really figured that out yet really. Because I think on the first week I had, I was taking like a 5 o\u2019clock bus home or maybe Todd was picking up Trae and coming to get me at 5. So I had an hour but I was kind of like scrambling to answer e-mail and do stuff I hadn\u2019t done all day because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">the whole day was kind of devoted to class. And last week was better because Todd had a meeting in the Square so he ended up popping over at the end of class and I found him outside, which was so funny, and it was so nice to see him. So then we went back home together and that was like a little bit better too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Is that something you can plan or was that totally bizarre that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: That was kind of bizarre, yeah. It just like randomly happened that he had that meeting around campus. But I think finding something to do like after class \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I think creating a ritual in some ways it\u2019s some ways similar to finding a ritual for soothing yourself and coming down before bed. The point of that is just having a transition from sort of like the day during which you\u2019re thinking about things and juggling things and, whether it be work <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">or Trae or something, and then at nighttime when you want to relax and settle down and drift off to sleep. So I think the same thing \u2013 finding a ritual that helps you transition from this day when you\u2019re very on and it\u2019s high energy and you do have some adrenalin from teaching. Because you don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B2\">to minimize that. That actually helps you have something that helps you to transition when that\u2019s over to the next part of your day where you\u2019re going to want to leave some of that adrenalin at work and feel more centered or calm.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think I do need to figure out some kind of strategy for that because I was home that first Friday and I was like, it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s been such a long week but I felt like I couldn\u2019t really relax. And so last week I think was different because there wasn\u2019t do much to do in that in between. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">But I have a feeling in the future it \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: You might not get to control that as there may be weeks when there is a lot to do and then there may be weeks when there is not. So finding something that is in your control for after \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And it might be something like meeting with a friend like if there\u2019s somebody else that\u2019s available so you can maybe go and sit someplace and share a coffee of tea and just kind of process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: You know, what happened during class so you can leave it at school. Or maybe it\u2019s finding a yoga class or someone to take a walk with or something you can put in place to be a buffer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that would be good. Because again, it\u2019s only been two weeks but I\u2019ve just kind of noticed it and I think the same thing happened last year too and it was the same \u2013 I think we met in the morning and then it was that scramble and then class and then it was the weekend when I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">to be feeling relaxed and I\u2019m like, but I\u2019m not. So, yeah, I think that will be good to think about, like what I could do. And it is kind of nice that I en have that \u2013 sometimes it feels like we\u2019re always staying late after class like talking to students. But I have at least a half an hour or something to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019ve got a couple of days where you\u2019re rushed to go pick up Trae?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And usually Todd will end up picking him up, on Fridays anyway. So that will be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So then you don\u2019t necessarily need to sort of be someplace on the dot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that will help. But that was just like one thing that I have noticed at the start of the semester that feels like this crazy day needing to feel like I, like on Thursday feel like I have to gear up for this crazy day that\u2019s going to be happening the next day. So I think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">will help to just think of something that will be in that in between time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: How have other days been going? Like is there space for taking care of yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: I feel like I haven\u2019t. I miss that Zumba class I\u2019d been going to and I haven\u2019t gotten back into that. I really want to but January was just such a weird month because classes weren\u2019t in session and it didn\u2019t feel like a routine really, but now that the semester is here it does feel like that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">missing. But it\u2019s just like the past couple of weeks I\u2019ve had \u2013 I think I was better last semester about just trying to reserve that time on Wednesdays and then since I hadn\u2019t been doing it all of January and really December, too. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been to that class. I\u2019ve kind of let that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B32\">slide and was making meetings and stuff at that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: So it might be picking a new time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Figuring out, sort of, what is the schedule going to be? You\u2019re just a couple of weeks in and it will take a couple more week before it starts to take shape and you can see sort of how long things actually take.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: So I think this is really time to look at, \u2018well, what happened the last couple of weeks?\u2019 Because that should be a pretty good indication of what the semester\u2019s going to look like and see where you can kind of structure some down time for yourself or a class to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I love doing that class, so I\u2019d love being able to do that again. Or there is another time but I think my work \u2013 but even to have those two options each week and figure out which ones would work \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Like (Unclear) the other <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And now, I keep saying to Todd, I can\u2019t wait to be outside, like I\u2019m just like just bad, it\u2019s only the beginning of February and I\u2019m like so ready for spring because it was so nice and last semester too getting home and sometimes going for a run with the stroller and just not being able <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">to do that, it\u2019s like feeling so cooped up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s been a tough winter so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: But now that Trae\u2019s so much bigger he\u2019ll be heavier to push I n the stroller going jogging with him but yeah, I feel like I do need to find a way to fitting that back in because just going to that class just once a week just felt better to have like something that I was consistently doing like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">some form of exercise like once a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you miss it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think now is the first time I\u2019ve realized it too because it was like December.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Things were so irregular and now you can see that there may be some regularity to schedule again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that will be really good. It made me feel like \u2013 like how I\u2019m sleeping is like always on my mind, too. And it has been pretty good but I feel like there are \u2013 I\u2019ll still have like those little things that I\u2019ll let myself worry, \u2018oh, is this going to mean that I\u2019m going to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">trouble falling back to sleep?\u2019 Like I\u2019ll still \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Looking through the day for things that fit that bill?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: That and little things that I think, in the past, I\u2019ve fallen asleep on the couch and then sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to fall asleep so that\u2019s something that I never let myself do but then if I am so tired and Todd and I are watching TV and sometimes I\u2019ll like jolt myself awake and say, \u2018oh <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">no, don\u2019t fall asleep on the couch.\u2019 Little things like that. And there was one night when Trae woke up in the middle of the night and I had trouble falling back to sleep and now I almost feel like that\u2019s another thing in my head, like if he wakes up thinking like don\u2019t let yourself think about anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D32\">just act like you\u2019re going to bed. So I feel like there are those little things that keep coming up. Like I feel like I can never feel fully confident that I will sleep well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: How often do those things actually get in the way? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, they haven\u2019t really. It\u2019s been nice not to really have that. Like and there have been a couple of \u2013 I don\u2019t know, a couple of nights in the past like two weeks but nothing compared to like when I would be up for this long stretch of time, but awake enough to be like, \u2018I hope this will <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">be okay.\u2019 But then I\u2019ll wake up in the morning like well, I did get myself back to sleep, so that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so that last thought is the one you want to hold onto and try to call up at those times, thinking about the times when those things went well rather than thinking about the times when things didn\u2019t \u2013 the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d \u2013 seeing if you can replace those with, \u2018remember that time I was able <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">to fall back to sleep?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: And there are some theories that evolutionarily it is more important for your brain to recall things that could go badly and use those as information, right? If you get eaten by a bear once it\u2019s like a really bad threat. And all the times you didn\u2019t get eaten by a bear don\u2019t really seem to count anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: So it makes sense why you\u2019re sort of primed to think about the what-ifs and to try to guard against disaster from happening. But it\u2019s really not as useful for us anymore because the things that are real dangers to us, if you don\u2019t fall asleep that one night, it\u2019s not really as bad a problem <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">as being out in the wild and getting hunted instead of being the hunter. So it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not dangerous for you to retrain your brain to think about the things that go well and the successes that you\u2019ve had and not to necessarily be ruled by this anxiety. The disasters just aren\u2019t the same kinds of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">disasters that we need to worry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Those thoughts might come up and then your job is not necessarily to engage those thoughts but to think about the times when it\u2019s been successful and to remind yourself of your success. That can give you a real sense of confidence. So when you hear Trae at night it\u2019s likely that like, \u2018oh <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">no,\u2019 comes up and then \u2013 I think we talked about this passing. You don\u2019t have to explain against it to yourself and you don\u2019t need to chastise yourself for having the thought. Those are ways of engaging it. What you can do is say, \u2018oh, there are lots of times when Trae woke up at night and I went back <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E52\">to sleep. Which, when you think back \u2013 is totally true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And you just tend to disregard those. You know, all those times when he as tiny and he woke up multiple times a night and he went back to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And working to remember those and each time you do that, it gets a little bit easier to go that direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: Right. I know and I feel there was a stretch when he was waking up and I know, like I knew if I went to check on him then it was easy for me to get back to sleep and it would be those times when I would wake up and would be asleep and I would just be lying in bed thinking if he just woke up <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">right now and needed me to go pat him, like that would help me get back to sleep. So it\u2019s like it sometimes feels like I switch on and off like what are those things that are going to be hard to get back to sleep for. So I do. Like, and it\u2019s nice that I do have lots of memories from when he was little that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and you can do this. And the same thing with falling sleep on the couch and yes, there may have been times when it was hard to get back to sleep but there are lots of times when I was able to fall asleep in one place and then another \u2013 and trying to stick with those thoughts and repeating <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">those consciously to yourself so that you can feel confident and secure and pretty calm about what you can do. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think that will help. Because I think it\u2019s nice that I haven\u2019t I don\u2019t have like this huge, long (unclear) like having to read and everything like I was doing before. But I do feel like I still have all these set things that I\u2019ll want to do before I go to bed so it does feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">still like I have that routine but at least it\u2019s not quite as long as \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like too much of a routine?

To Todd it is because he\u2019s always like, \u2018come to bed,\u2019 because the light is on and he\u2019s kind of waiting for me to come to bed, but yeah it definitely feels much better but it does feel like there are all of these \u2013 but things like I was always doing before, too (unclear) aware <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">of them now, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: If it\u2019s working, that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: And it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s too burdensome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: If it becomes too cumbersome then you can start to eliminate one piece from the routine and whittle it down to something that feels more manageable but it sounds like it feels pretty manageable to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: You may need to start it, to be five minutes earlier \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">(Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: Or he can start five minutes later?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I think if it\u2019s working for you right now, then sticking with it and if it becomes too much then you pick one piece to kind of eliminate at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that sounds good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: And you know you can do that because you have sort of taken a routine that was a little bit too involved and whittled it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. I felt like with that though, it was so helpful to have like this huge length \u2013 like it was Trae being born. (Cross talk) So I think that helped to whittle that down. But now I think it\u2019s okay but I\u2019ve definitely like noticed there are certain things that I want to make sure are part of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201131\">like getting ready to go to bed that I\u2019ll do every night and but that it does feel okay at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there\u2019s nothing wrong with getting a routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know, I think it\u2019s maybe just because I\u2019m a person who loves her (unclear) and I think Todd could care less about those that really have (unclear) (cross talk). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: During the day it doesn\u2019t matter so much because you\u2019re off in separate places working in your own kind of style. And bedtimes is one of those times when the mismatch in your styles is more evident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. But I think that was like, I don\u2019t know, I think that was like, that was kind of the main thing, just thinking about something that I can do after Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: When you wind down after the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it hasn\u2019t really been like sleeping hasn\u2019t been too bad, but I just noticed those things kind of pop up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: Do you ever get to read for pleasure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Could that end of the day on Friday be a half hour when you read something for pleasure? Or don\u2019t you want to read for pleasure anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: No, I would love to. I feel like that\u2019s something I miss. I was reading something like this wonderful book, like I would say if I had the chance to finish it it would probably be one of my most favorite \u2013 but then I kind of like stopped reading it and now it\u2019s been like a month and I only have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201271\">like 50 pages left and I never finished it and I just found it in the car yesterday. But yeah, I definitely miss that part. So that o be a good idea too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561817\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: I wonder if that might be a time when you kind of slot out \u2013 even if it\u2019s 15 minutes to find a corner and be able to read something that\u2019s just for pleasure, just kind of creating a little window for yourself as a way to \u2013 that might be one type of thing you could do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea too. And that\u2019s easy to just do right after, it\u2019s not like it takes coordinating (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Some of the other ideas that came to me initially kind of have to depend on other things and then it\u2019s easy for that to get lost like if one of those pieces falls out, it\u2019s harder to say (Unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: But if reading something pleasurable would be a way that helps you to kind of calm down or let go of the frenzied work pace, then that\u2019s not dependent on (unclear) cancelling or (unclear) not cancelling or a class scheduled that you want to be at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so if you could maybe experiment with that, see how it works. Another thing that\u2019s sort of independent from everything else would be finding a place to like listen to some music that you like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: Or just something you can do on your own that will help you get into a different zone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: Right. And I even think that once it\u2019s nicer out to just be able to like walk home, take a walk. Because it\u2019s a far walk in the snow and everything. And when I have a heavy bag. But I can plan when it\u2019s nicer (unclear) and do that because I think that might help, too, to have the time to walk home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That will be a little bit easier, say a month from now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: I know. I\u2019m ready. It will be fun to have Trae back on the playground now. He would be so much bigger. I feel like he\u2019ll be doing like these different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, anything else we should catch up on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s everything, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s take time some time to do some relaxation. Are we all caught up scheduling-wise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll just double check. I think so, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: I think we are too, actually. You tried to schedule around your Arizona trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: I vaguely remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">(Pause): [00:29:46 00:29:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: I next have you on Wednesday the 26th at 3:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah, great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: And then we did not schedule for March as far as I can see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t think so either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: Do you want the Monday at 12:30 or do you want the Wednesday at 3:30?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">CLIENT: Now, Monday at 12:30 might be best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Okay.
