Even if you\u2019re not paying down, that\u2019s the amount owed for July and (inaudible 00:32) last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Okay, cool. Yeah, I bought a check, and then I can give you another one Friday. What\u2019s happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Not much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m psyched to be here. I feel like it was a long time, since I only saw you once last week. So, doing okay. It\u2019s just a transitional time, man. I\u2019m in, like, this weird (pause) I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to explain. I think about it. I\u2019m like, \u201cHow am I feeling today?\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">can\u2019t (laughter) Sunday, I was feeling kind of depressed. I got depressed Sunday, but a lot of that is because it\u2019s Sunday. Some Sundays, I just get kind of melancholy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">In general, it\u2019s hard. Like, I think I\u2019m doing well. I was thinking about this the other day. I went fishing over the weekend, right. So I\u2019m going fishing no, and even before fishing, the day before I went fishing, my friend this is one of my older Assyrian friends. Awesome, awesome guy. He\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">guy I went to his wedding in Cairo. He married his kindergarten sweetheart or whatever. And he\u2019s a complete flake. I mean, this guy I don\u2019t know how you can get to that age, have a wife and children and be so flakey, but we love him, because he\u2019s just such a sweet person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">But he had texted me Friday evening, and he was like, \u201cI\u2019m out fishing. Come,\u201d you know. It was beautiful out, whatever, so I was like, \u201cYeah, awesome.\u201d So I go to cast a line, and of course, then I stopped hearing back from him. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, I\u2019m fucking here. I\u2019m here now.\u201d Nothing. Now, not only <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">did I not get upset, I was like, \u201cWell, you know what, I\u2019m here. It\u2019s beautiful outside.\u201d I got out. I had myself a lobster roll from a local bar. I just walked around. I took pictures of the sunset. And I was thinking about this on the way back. I was like, \u201cNow, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Like, in some ways, I feel like I\u2019m trying to find ways to say that I\u2019m not feeling so great. I\u2019m so used to it. You know what I mean? You know what I\u2019m saying? Like, I\u2019m so hardwired to be like, \u201cYeah.\u201d (Mumbling) It\u2019s my mother\u2019s side, you know. But it\u2019s like, what? The water is beautiful. I\u2019m here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">I\u2019m not having an anxiety attack. It\u2019s not even crossing my mind. I\u2019m just here, you know. I\u2019m not upset that Louis (sp?) is being Louis. I was texting my friend. I\u2019m like, \u201cHere\u2019s a good Louis story for you.\u201d And that was that. Like, it didn\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">And then the next day he called me, and we did go fishing. We went to the Canal, you know. I was like, \u201cWow, look at me. I\u2019m fishing.\u201d Like, I haven\u2019t done that since I was a kid, you know. And I\u2019m having a great time and not I was in no way feeling anything. I was just there, fishing, you know. Enjoying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">it. So I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is maybe (pause) what I\u2019m feeling a lot of is more of, like, a weird disconnect between the fact that I\u2019m, I guess, doing pretty well and that I\u2019m hardwired to think I\u2019m not doing well. That\u2019s some articulate shit right there, right? You know what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561724\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Even just, like, what is so constantly in your mind is to evaluate whether you\u2019re doing -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: That too, that I\u2019m constantly scanning to see how am I feeling. I mean, I\u2019m doing it here, but out there, I\u2019m doing it less. Yeah, less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And even in here. I think that\u2019s, in a way, one of the things you\u2019re saying. What if that [isn\u2019t meant] (ph) to be such much of a question? Of course some days are going to be worse than others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Now, it\u2019s like, yeah, it\u2019s not the same thing, you know. And now, even in here, it\u2019s not so much scanning. I think in the past, it really was like a scan, literally. Like, why does my hand feel weird? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Even of (ph) your body, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Everything, you know. Now it\u2019s more like now it\u2019s just contemplation kind of, you know. Now it\u2019s just more like introspection or, you know, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: And what more is there beyond -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, like, now -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 05:19) not well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, now things are kind of good, I guess, you know. I don\u2019t know. Another weird thing. I bought there\u2019s a really great book on life coaching, but also as the business component of I think I told you about it, right? I bought it on what day it was, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Friday (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. Now, all this ADD talk yeah, right, I bought it before I came here. All this ADD talk, right, I read the book. I just read it, you know what I mean. So I was, like, laughing at myself. I\u2019m like, you know, I\u2019m reading it at the coffee shop. I read it at home. I read it why? You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">what I mean? Like, why am I suddenly so interested? I\u2019m totally focused. I\u2019m reading the book. And I\u2019m not worried about am I really getting what it\u2019s saying or am I I\u2019m just reading it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">So that\u2019s another interesting thing, you know. It\u2019s like, well, it\u2019s because I\u2019m finally motivated to do something that I am motivated to do. I\u2019m not trying to please anybody. I\u2019m not trying to I\u2019m not half faking it, you know. So that\u2019s another interesting thing. It was also a good sign that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">means I\u2019m on the right path. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? If this was a half-baked idea, you know. But, you know. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like it feels like it\u2019s really yours and you\u2019re choosing, you\u2019re making. It\u2019s not about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: And then it\u2019s not some just foofy (ph), abstract aspiration, you know. It\u2019s becoming more and more of a concrete, like, business plan, you know. There\u2019s that. Then the other big thing. This one\u2019s a little kind of crazy. I don\u2019t know. But why not? I thought about it. So remember on Friday, we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">were like, \u201cOh, maybe you feel,\u201d you know. \u201cLike, what if you had studied psychology?\u201d Remember that? So when I (chuckles) got home, I\u2019m like, \u201cWait a second.\u201d So I was like, \u201cMaybe I should.\u201d You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">So I remembered that my friend Stephen\u2019s sister just finished her PhD in psychology at UConn. And I was like, \u201cMaybe UConn\u2019s going to come through again for me.\u201d So I looked at their program. I was like, \u201cMaybe I should fucking do this. I don\u2019t know.\u201d If anyone would be good at this and has the right <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">background, I think it\u2019s me. I just can\u2019t afford I mean, someone has to pay for it. What do you think? Is that crazy? And of course, I did all this research about, like, is it stupid to go become a psychologist when you\u2019re, like, 40 years old?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561724\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a big investment. I think it would have to (inaudible 08:17) know about. What it means to, what it would be for you. What the conscious layers (inaudible 08:24) the unconscious layers (inaudible 08:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I mean, I just feel like, for the first time, it would be a combination of practicality and passion, you know. And also, like, wow, I mean, then you\u2019re talking about an amazing combo. Someone\u2019s who studied literature, who\u2019s a writer, you know. That\u2019s a pretty powerful combination. And for my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">business. Then certified, mortified (ph), whatever. (Laughter) I mean, what\u2019s, you know. That\u2019d be very, very I mean, it really, like, it would be an investment in the business, I think, you know, because then I could take it to a whole other level, you know. I don\u2019t know. But, I mean, obviously, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">I mean, I know that graduate school is no fucking joke. But, you know, maybe it\u2019d be different if someone was paying for it. I\u2019ve never had that really, you know. So that stress would be gone, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So are you going to get a loan or the school paying for it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Every program I looked at, they pay for whoever they take, they pay for, you know. I mean, that would be a huge (pause) I mean, I\u2019ve never had that happen, you know. Not to mention, I feel like my engagement with it would be very different. I\u2019m in such a different I mean, it would almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">be like if I went now to do a PhD, if I started all over again to do a it\u2019s still might not be the right choice for me, but I would be a very different student, you know what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 09:58) in literature? Or you\u2019re talking about if you started (crosstalk 10:00).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: If I went back to grad school now. Let\u2019s say I was going back to London now, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: In writing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m just saying, like, I\u2019m just a very different person now, you know what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: But with psychology, the interesting thing would be it\u2019s not just about, like it\u2019s not that half-assed like, \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll study literature, because that\u2019s what I do.\u201d You know what II mean? Like, there was no I didn\u2019t really want to be a I mean, I did want to be a professor, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">it was not really fully committed. If you really want to be a professor, you will go to Wisconsin or whatever the you know what I mean? So it was just kind of just winging it kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">But this would be something where, like, well, I already have a business. It\u2019s like someone going to get an MBA, when they\u2019ve already, you know. They just want that extra credential and expertise and, you know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Did you ever you\u2019d be having this conversation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Five years ago?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s fucked up, but it feels I don\u2019t know. Somewhat (ph), it feels (pause) and I really feel like I\u2019d be a good candidate, you know. I\u2019m not just some 22 year old psychology major. I mean, I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: A lot of it I mean, I\u2019m sure you saw this when you looked.

You have to have a research-based thesis at the end. So I don\u2019t know if <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">that\u2019s up your alley. (inaudible 11:46)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah, yeah. A lot of them are, like, the first year you have to take statistics and psychology or whatever. Yeah, there\u2019s definitely it\u2019s not a cakewalk. Yeah, it\u2019s definitely not up my alley. But again, I think the difference would be (pause) it is like sucking it up in a way. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">like saying, well, but this isn\u2019t just like, \u201cI just love psychology,\u201d you know what I mean? It\u2019s a practical decision. So fine, for two semesters, I have to suck it up and take this course. Or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.

I mean, shit, there\u2019s (pause), <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">you know. I don\u2019t know. Just be honest though. Should I not even think about it, or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think I mean, I\u2019m not here to say -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: For Christ sake. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: I am going to give you an honest opinion about some aspect of it, but what I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t think you know or I could know right now whether that actually would be good for you to pursue. There\u2019s so much more to know about it as a fit, do you know what I mean? There\u2019s a lot to know about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">even, like, the reality of who get their incredibly competitive programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yes, no doubt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Who gets in are often people who have had four years of research at NGH in the trauma lab, and that they have several publications already, and that\u2019s how you get into graduate school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: What? But what\u2019s their credentials before, you mean? They have master\u2019s or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: No, they will have had a bachelor degree. They actually often don\u2019t take people who have master\u2019s degree because they can consider you\u2019ve already fallen off the track already. If you say, for example, if you say something very honest and you tell them if you\u2019re going into a program like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">that and say, \u201cI want to be a clinician,\u201d you won\u2019t get accepted automatically. They want researchers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: The whole way they pay your way is if so you get on a government funded grant. You do research the whole time you\u2019re doing your program, about 20 hours of research a week. And then the idea is that you\u2019re then going to be paying back the government over time by becoming a professor at an <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">institution. You\u2019d get your own grants and do your own research. So they really look down -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: So what, so all these people have to kind of lie? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: See, you know, a lot -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: I mean, obviously, a lot of people want to do what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Some people lie. I mean, I was young enough I didn\u2019t know what I I thought I might have even wanted to go into research at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s what you did. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561724\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I just didn\u2019t know. And I think some people find clinical work over the course of it, but I\u2019m just saying to you as someone coming in a little bit more mid-career. This is all the kind of thing you want to be thinking about. What would you say? How do you or is a doctoral program the right <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">fit? Would something like a social work program or licensed mental health counselor or MSPP? Psychology they won\u2019t pay your way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. See, I\u2019m worried I already went through this master\u2019s bullshit. I think master\u2019s programs don\u2019t pay you, right, so that\u2019s the problem. I just refuse to do that again, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: So it could be that you\u2019d get in, but you\u2019d really have to make you might not get in the first round of applications, and you\u2019d have to get a year or two of experience working in a lab before getting in. That\u2019s often what people do who don\u2019t get in the first time around, you know, when <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">they\u2019re 21. A lot of people don\u2019t get in. Then they do a couple years of research, and then reapply. Shape their interests and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: There are no programs that are different than that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: There are a couple, but it\u2019s a dying breed. You know, like Adelphi on Long Island is a very psychodynamic program. You\u2019ll do some research, but it\u2019s not as rigorously research oriented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: And of course, none of those are around here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, none that would pay your way. There might be some you\u2019d look into, like BC and Suffolk. There\u2019s still going to be some research. I think there\u2019s going to be a stipend, but that\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019m just broadening what you\u2019re thinking about, what that actually looks like. The reason, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">I mean, you don\u2019t get something for nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: The reason they\u2019re paying your way is because there\u2019s an expectation you\u2019re going into being (crosstalk 16:09) ten-year track professor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s good to know. Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t have my heart set on it, but I think it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an idea, and it sounds like it struck a chord. You feel like that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: I would definitely do the master\u2019s if someone paid for it. That\u2019s the problem, is that, you know. (Pause) But, yeah. I mean, I guess I could look into that. Maybe they do offer some fellowships or something. Who in the hell knows? But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Look at maybe the smaller schools. Like a state school is going to be very research based. UConn is very research based. And who knows? I mean, maybe (ph) when you start looking into the research side of things, it becomes appealing? I just, like I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s a piece of the equation, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">as you\u2019re thinking about (inaudible 17:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, or you just suck it up and say, \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll just enjoy this. I can make this work while I\u2019m there, and then once I\u2019m done\u2026\u201d (Pause) Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You look deflated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s just, you know, when I think about all these things, it\u2019s a little it is so, like you said, like, what am I this is so different than, you know. No, no, I\u2019m deflated. And that\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t really (pause) that\u2019s a good thing these days. I\u2019m not really extreme either way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">you know what I mean? I think it\u2019d be a good idea, maybe, to look into. But it really just is a practical decision. I just want my business to work. And I am finding that I think it will work. It\u2019s just going to be harder for me, I think, because I have to why are people going to see me? You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">I\u2019m literally telling people to see me because of, yes, I did go to graduate school, blah, blah, blah. But it\u2019s really, I\u2019m just saying, \u201cHere\u2019s my overall package as a person, you know. I feel qualified to do this.\u201d That\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m very confident. It could take longer though, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561724\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">But, yeah. I don\u2019t know. Yeah, maybe it\u2019s worth looking into, like, a master\u2019s thing. (Pause) I also sent an e-mail to London, because they had sent me an e-mail several months ago, saying it\u2019s kind of like what I got from Brown. It\u2019s kind of like, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not here, you know. So you\u2019re not here,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">you know. But I\u2019d written to the new guy that\u2019s running the because Jason retired. So I didn\u2019t hear back, so I\u2019m going to write to the woman above him and just be like, \u201cLook. What do I need to do to -\u201d I mean, you know? I just want to finish this fucking thing. Can I just write my dissertation and, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF2\">you know. She\u2019s a very nice lady and, you know, I think she\u2019d, you know. I\u2019m just going to be honest. Say, \u201cLook. I\u2019m not from the UK. Financially, it was very difficult. It was very stressful, but I\u2019m in a much better situation now overall. Financially, not so much, but in other,\u201d you know. I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF3\">want to finish. I\u2019m just so close, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s left? Just writing -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: I mean, the coursework\u2019s done, but even in the coursework, there were essays and stuff that I missed and all that. It didn\u2019t seem to matter, kind of. It\u2019s fucking UK. I don\u2019t know. But, to me, that\u2019s all really, those essays are just part of your dissertation. It\u2019s kind of smart in a way. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">Basically, what they\u2019re saying is every semester, it\u2019s as if you\u2019re writing this tiny chapter, and hopefully that turns into you know what I mean? It\u2019s just writing, and everything\u2019s done. I\u2019ve done the coursework. I\u2019ve, you know. Not to mention, I mean, the other fucking students. Like, come on. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B32\">I published with, you know. I mean, like, (laughter) I deserve to finish this fucking thing. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And yet, you still have to do the work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, well the thing is now, like I said, I\u2019m in such a different place now, it\u2019ll get done. If I just knew how I could get -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: [Like these will be] (ph) the steps?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, like, let me know how to do this, and then I\u2019ll do it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that seems like the most obvious, like the easiest, in a way, to add this credential to your resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Right, instead of just saying, I went to graduate school, you know, these are the actual degrees. You know, yeah. See, with UConn -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: And not to mention that you\u2019d then have something you could publish (inaudible 21:12).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 21:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Right, right. Same with UConn. And they\u2019re always very nice. I\u2019m like, \u201cLook, you know. Situations are very different now. I know it\u2019s been a long time, but, I mean, I did everything. I just didn\u2019t hand in my master\u2019s thesis. Come on, like, you know, there has to be a way to do the you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">Was there a statute of limitations on come on. And they\u2019re always very nice, but nothing I never hear a concrete like, \u201cOkay, this is what you need to do.\u201d So I\u2019m going to try that again as well, you know. Just -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561724\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Meaning that they don\u2019t get back to you or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: They initially get back. They say, \u201cOh, yeah. You know, we can totally, you know.\u201d And then I follow, \u201cThank you. That\u2019s awesome. Please just let me know what steps I -\u201d and then I don\u2019t hear back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You can march on into their office if you need to. (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I might do that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: If you want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Because, yeah, I don\u2019t buy it. There\u2019s always a way come on. There\u2019s always a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Have they said there isn\u2019t a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: They haven\u2019t, but I think I did read somewhere you know grad schools have these things where if it takes more than five years, then, you know. I don\u2019t buy any of that. There\u2019s always someone that can the dean or whatever. You know what I mean? There\u2019s always someone that can be like, \u201cWait <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">a second.\u201d Because it\u2019s good for them. They want to be able to say people graduated. Like, \u201cWe put,\u201d you know. And again, especially I feel like I\u2019m look, I\u2019m a published I mean, I came out of your program. I published a book of I mean, I\u2019m doing things. I need to hand this fucking thing in, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that sounds like that\u2019s hard to negotiate over e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: I guess. Yeah, maybe this time -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 23:03)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Maybe this time I\u2019ll be like, you know, \u201cI\u2019d love to come in and, you know.\u201d I\u2019ve even told them. I said, \u201cLook, I talked to Chuck. He\u2019s my mentor.\u201d He\u2019s my, you know. I was like, \u201cHe\u2019s totally fine with it. I just need to know what to do.\u201d But anyway, in other words, I\u2019m being, you know. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">printed out my new poetry manuscript. I have plenty of pages. It\u2019s just not, you know. So I\u2019m going to finally get that going. I think I do need to I\u2019m scared to e-mail Jason and be like, \u201cDo you want to publish my second -\u201d you know, like, are my publisher now, or still? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">So yeah. So I mean, there\u2019s just a lot going on. All positive, but it\u2019s just a lot. The other negative not so much negative. The only, like, kind of difficult thing is some days, I do, maybe because I am doing better and better, I do feel more lonely, kind of. That\u2019s been kind of tough, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">I think it\u2019s\u2019 just hard to not share with somebody. (Pause) And yet, I know I\u2019m being healthy about it, because I\u2019m not willy nilly just finding some girlfriend, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Say more about lonely. What\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just lonely. I mean, you know, it\u2019s hard. Like, I just feel ready to have a normal situation. As normal as you can get, you know. So it\u2019s just I mean, even the girl in Delaware, you know, whatever. She might come Sunday to hang out for a day or two. That\u2019s fine, but (pause), you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">how is that going to work? That\u2019s not, you know. She\u2019s great, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">Like, I think I\u2019m finally accepting that I\u2019m always going to have this kind of sadness and conflict about, like, Assyrian, not Assyrian. Like, there\u2019s just no I can\u2019t seem to figure that out, you know, and there\u2019s no easy answer, you know. Did I tell you what my priest said to me, at the coffee shop? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Your priest?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, technically. I don\u2019t go to church, but the church that we belong to, whatever, in Cheshire? So I ran into Father I\u2019m trying to think. Larry. That\u2019s his name. So I ran into at the coffee shop. He\u2019s such a nice man, such a nice man. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh,\u201d you know. And then I\u2019m just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">because of my uncle and my family, there\u2019s always a reference for clergy, especially when you can tell they\u2019re a good person, because they\u2019re all just fucking businessmen now, you know. But the ones who are very sweet and, you know. So I see him. He\u2019s getting his coffee, whatever, and we\u2019re just talking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB2\">He had stomach whatever, you know. (Pause) When people are fat, they get that surgery, whatever that is?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561724\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">So, you know, he just looks completely so I\u2019m always, you know, \u201cHow\u2019s your health? How are you feeling?\u201d Whatever. So that was about it, whatever. I was about to go back to where I was sitting, and he\u2019s like, \u201cBrian, I want to tell you something.\u201d He\u2019s like, you know, I know I don\u2019t post on -\u201d We\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">Facebook friends.

It\u2019s just not my style or whatever.\u201d But he\u2019s like, you know, \u201cWhen all that stuff was happening with the attacks in Cheshire and everything,\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cI really want to tell you, like, you were writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED2\">a lot of things that really were very powerful.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cAnd I use some of it in my sermon.\u201d (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d It was the sweetest I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible honor. That\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I just wanted to say that it was very, very insightful, very moving stuff that you wrote.\u201d That is so cool. So cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: That a priest is using it in a sermon. It (ph) says something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, so that was another way I felt like, okay, so I\u2019m on the right (pause), you know. I\u2019m on the right path. There\u2019s something that I think I can somehow help people or speak to them and, like, connect with them. But yeah, I was like, what an honor. That was awesome. Especially someone I like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">you know. Like, he\u2019s such a good guy. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: You should be a priest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: My cousin was like, \u201cDude, just be a priest.\u201d (Laughter) \u201cThey make money.

Ha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, the Assyrian church is really amazing. It really is the great if you\u2019re a Christian, it\u2019s unreal. They take no position on abortion. They take no position on premarital sex. They just kind of they do like, you know, like, \u201cWe just don\u2019t involved,\u201d you know. They take no position on <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">homosexuality. It\u2019s unreal. It\u2019s unreal. They are such for such an ancient church, they\u2019re unbelievable. They have a really, like, a you know, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going around with the gay flag and shit, obviously. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of conservative people. But it\u2019s kind of like a (pause) live <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB2\">and let live or don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell kind of thing, you know, which is amazing for a very you know, they\u2019re not some Unitarian I mean, this is a hardcore ancient tradition, you know. So yeah, no, they\u2019re pretty amazing. They\u2019re pretty amazing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how this sounds, like a na\u00efve (ph) question about it, but the church, is it a particular religion?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: Apostolic.

Does that mean more conservative?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: No, it just means more ritualistic. So the idea is that Assyrians got Christianity directly from two of the apostles. Like, it\u2019s way back, way back. Very beautiful. Like, there\u2019s a lot of pageantry, but not in a Catholic way. It\u2019s not like this kind of intimidating, scary kind of it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">the music is mind-blowingly beautiful. There\u2019s a lot of mysticism. There\u2019s still some pagan things that have been incorporated. The colors, like the stuff the I mean, it\u2019s pretty amazing. I mean, you could go to Mass just for, like, it\u2019s almost like a meditation kind of. There\u2019s no confession. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201032\">don\u2019t believe in confession. I mean, you could go and see the priest and talk to him, but, you know, it\u2019s like, you want to confess, just (chuckles) tell God your problems. There\u2019s not a lot of guilt. The sermons aren\u2019t about feeling guilty and wicked and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: Not sinning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Not sinning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s not.

You\u2019re going to have a a lot of those people don\u2019t care, you know. They just come. For a lot of people, it\u2019s a social hour, you know. And, you know, there\u2019s politics. There\u2019s office, you know what I mean, committees and meetings and fucking crap. Yeah. I\u2019d be a good, like, monk, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201151\">(chuckles) you know what I mean? But that\u2019s serious shit. I mean, they\u2019ve always wanted anyone in my family, because of my uncle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: Yeah, they\u2019ve always, you know. My cousin who\u2019s at MSU now, the professor, the jackass? You know, they kind of wanted him. They wanted me. They wanted my dad, you know. Not to be a priest, but the idea was, you know, you\u2019ll be groomed. Groomed? Yeah, you\u2019ll be groomed to be like my uncle, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201191\">hopefully, you know. That has to be a calling. That\u2019s not a, you know. Even if you could be good at it, you know what I mean?

(inaudible 33:16) just the nuts and bolts of what actual graduate psychology program -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just a lot, yeah. It\u2019s a lot. It makes my head hurt a little bit. But I think I\u2019m in this place now where I know that big changes are coming. I am definitely antsy. Like, you know, things are already changing here, but I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019m antsy. I\u2019m energized. I\u2019m highly (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F1\">motivated. So it\u2019s like I just, [you know] (ph). I am a little overwhelmed. I mean, I need to keep things kind of compartmental. You know, there\u2019s music. It\u2019s a lot of stuff, you know. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: You know, as we\u2019re talking about the alumnus that comes up, in some ways even more you become aware of it, as things get better, that I think as certain parts of yourself can develop and grow, you become more aware. Not just you people become more aware of what was missing all along. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201211\">so much right now, even just as you were talking about some of these ideas and then talking them through out loud. It just reminds me of what\u2019s been missing for you and your family, about guidance and support.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20120-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20120-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561724\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah. See, that\u2019s the thing. Look how easy it is, you know what I mean? If I had just been raised in a way that was, like, \u201cYou\u2019re so talented. Absolutely. You\u2019re going to do music, write, you know. What can we think of? You know, have you thought about maybe how could you use your skills in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201231\">a way that you make money and you\u2019re happy?\u201d You know what I mean? It\u2019s so easy. It\u2019s so, you know. But this, like, black and white bullshit that they, that they still have, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: Instead of, like, taking your good idea and then helping (inaudible 35:26), think about (inaudible 35:27). How do you make that practical?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: It automatically has to be, like, \u201cWell, no, those are just hobbies. Get over it. Those are little hobbies. You can do them on the weekends, but you need a (mumbling).\u201d You know, like, it\u2019s all this fucking nonsense, you know. And they\u2019re still, you know. My uncle\u2019s kind of gone back to being <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201271\">like that now. The richer he\u2019s gotten, he\u2019s become, like, this very, you know. He\u2019s kind of gone back to being a Republican in a way. It\u2019s like, you know, this is a country of opportunity. Just work hard and (mumbling), you know. It\u2019s just so fucking 1980, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like, come on, man. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201272\">Clearly, that\u2019s not the case, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">You know, complaining about taxes and this. It\u2019s like, \u201cDude. (Chuckles) You can pay 50 percent. Obviously you\u2019re doing fine. You can\u2019t just buy a house on that street and complain about taxes. I\u2019m sorry. You just can\u2019t. You have to suck it up, you know.\u201d So, like, it\u2019s just this very rigid, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201291\">And, you know, I guess a lot of immigrants are that way, you know. They don\u2019t know how else to think of it. Because in a way, this, what we\u2019re talking about, is kind of a luxurious way of thinking, you know what I mean? Not a lot of immigrants can think that. They have to be so enlightened and so kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201292\">of quirky almost like my dad\u2019s side. Just innately kind of eccentric and mellow. I don\u2019t know what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">But, you know, for most immigrants, it\u2019s like survival, you know. We busted our ass. We\u2019ve come, you know, from a really shitty background. It\u2019s just about we just want to breathe and have some fucking money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">THERAPIST: When (ph) it becomes necessarily so practical to (ph) survive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah, because they stay in a bubble kind of. Like music, whatever, these things seem like alien, you know. That\u2019s what trust fund and a lot of that is true, of course. I mean, no one\u2019s doubting that. I think a lot of artists, they do come from some money, you know. There\u2019s no doubt about it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F1\">Some successful artists, they\u2019re able to stick with it because there is some monetary support, you know. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. That\u2019s like saying some people are CEOs because they were born into wealthy families. I mean, that\u2019s so what? A lot of people aren\u2019t that way and they still, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F2\">you know. But they don\u2019t have that nuanced way of thinking. Everything is very, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">I guess the difference now though is I don\u2019t feel so (pause) sad when I think of all that, you know what I mean? I almost feel, like, relief that, oh my god, like, now I\u2019m here (chuckles), and I\u2019ve got a plan, you know what I mean?

That shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d And then there was a lot of shitty stuff. But because now I have so extricated myself, I don\u2019t really call my uncle anymore to have a coffee. I\u2019m just kind of done, you know what I mean? I\u2019ll show up to <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201351\">family things if I have to, whatever. But I just I don\u2019t want to waste my energy anymore, you know, because I just see them (pause), you know.

You know, my mom\u2019s kind of come a ways. And my grandmother\u2019s still a tough cookie, you know. Everyone else, I feel like, is just, you know. I don\u2019t know. And even with my mom, you know, I gauge her, you know. When I say hi, I can tell. If she\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201371\">start bitching and moaning, I\u2019m out of there, you know. I don\u2019t let it get to me at all anymore the same way I used to. And I don\u2019t I\u2019m not angry about my grandmother, you know. I\u2019ve done a pretty good job of just completely cutting they\u2019re old. Even my mom. I mean, God forbid. You know, one day <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201372\">she\u2019s not going to be she\u2019s fucking 70. I mean, you have to it is kind of liberating, in a way, to just be like, \u201cOkay, things these are the phases of life, and you have to, you know.

It\u2019s nice to (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B1\">instead of all this being in your head and just kind of sorting it out on your own, it\u2019s nice to just have someone who\u2019s kind of cheering you on and, you know. That\u2019s just a bummer, you know. Because that\u2019s one thing I have liked about all the girls I\u2019ve dated, you know. They have all been very excited <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B2\">for things I\u2019m doing and, you know, that\u2019s a good feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 42:03) for you to be known for you, and then to be really be excited about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, and also, it\u2019s a nice feeling. Then it\u2019s not just about you. You can care for someone else, you know what I mean? It just, you know. I mean, obviously, it\u2019s different, in a way, but that\u2019s why I love my cat, you know. It\u2019s just like that I don\u2019t think about these things, you know. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201411\">just petting her. I\u2019m just, you know. I have to feed her, you know. I have (chuckles) you know what I mean?
