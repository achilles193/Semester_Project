(therapist responds) They take up all those spaces and over here, it gets all nuts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: The construction, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah, so you can't park anywhere, anytime now like, it's closed off and stuff. So people that would park there, I think, it gets more saturated here. (sighs) Oh, man! (sighs) So... (pause) Um... Yeah, I don't know. Um, I've been waking up weird lately. (therapist responds) Like, early, early, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">like morning, my hand's been cramped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: (responds) Your left hand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like, it would like, almost like a nerve or something (therapist responds) like, my two fingers or something. I don't know, and like kind of weird, I don't know, it's been kind of freaking me out a little bit, but... I'm sure... I'm probably not sleeping soundly or something like that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: You're a righty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I just hope it's not, I don't know. My uncle was saying... Before he was diagnosed with the diabetes, he was getting a lot of cramps in his legs, and calves, and all that. I don't think it's that, but... Yeah, I don't know. It's just weird. I don't know if I'm just like, having <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">anxiety dreams that sometimes I don't remember when I wake up or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">The weird part is, I wake up like that, and I don't feel well or whatever. You know, it feels kind of like, tight here, like almost like... The other thing, I probably should get checked out is, I mean, years ago I was diagnosed with like, mild sleep apnea (therapist responds), you know. So I worry <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">that, you know, I didn't really do anything about it at the time. (sighs) So, you know, that will do it, if you're not breathing right, or whatever. You wake up and you feel... you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">But, so, but then the odd thing is, then when I fall back asleep (therapist responds), then I wake up... I mean, I sleep deeply and I wake up without those issues. (therapist responds) That's what I don't get, but... So, it's been happening the last few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">[pause 00:02:25 to 00:02:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I mean, I think like, there is probably a lot of... I'm doing a good job of managing my anxiety, but I think there is a lot of it, you know what I mean? It's like, the past, where it's... I'm like, freaking out or something. I'm functioning, but I have a feeling there is a lot of deep stuff going on, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">especially for whatever reason like, this past month or so, maybe. (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(pause) It's like, what do you, you know, I mean, there is just a lot, all at the same time. It's hard to... I think it's hard, I'm having trouble kind of rela-like... relaxing my mind or you know like, even though I feel like I'm pretty much doing well, but (therapist responds), I wonder if some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">that's just, just kind of, I have a high tolerance or something. (therapist responds) I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">Like, you know, last night, I saw my two Assyrian friends. We had a great time. You know, like it's not, when I'm out and about, generally, it's not... I'm not like, all preoccupied by my anxiety, or whatever. But, so I think it's just a general... (aside: sorry; my shirt's tight!), it's just like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">general state that I think is... you know. (therapist responds). (sighs) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560556\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: You have a lot of big changes that you're anticipating (client affirms) and waiting for, it seems to (inaudible) (blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, plus there are changes, plus there is all this stuff here, that is about the past, you know what I mean? So, just as I'm excited for all the changes, changes make you anxious anyway (because they could work or not work or whatever), but then I'm... It's almost a constant reminder of... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">things are great now, but they could have been great ten years ago (therapist responds), you know what I mean? Like, that's what I'm hav , that's really a tough one. And that's not going to go away tomorrow. I mean, it just is what it is. Time is, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">You know like, in my head, I play it out and that's kind of devastating. (therapist responds) Like, I'll be like, \"Yeah, I might finish this novel, I might not. I mean, who knows when my next book's going to come out? I could be 45!\" Well, I probably will be 45. I mean, by the time the book actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">gets published. First you have to finish the fucking thing, but so I'll be like, my mid-40s, maybe even later than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">You know what I mean like, I play these things out in my head. I'm like, \"Wow, really! I'm going to be 50 soon!\" And boy, what's that? I'm going to be a 50-year-old dude in like, a rock band and shit? Like... That's like cognitive dis , it's not making sense. And of course, you can do it; why not? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">Of course! I mean, you can do all those things. But it's just like, \"Wow, man!\" Like, these, this feeling that I have, where I am now, this is what you're supposed to feel when you're in your late 20s, or whatever, you know? And that's... I'm having trouble swallowing that, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I'm doing a good job, I think, you know. But that's... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: It's a tremendous amount of grief. Almost unbearable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah it is almost. And I think what's hap , and I think part, that's part of the reason I think why it's hard for me to just pick a girl and settle, you know what I mean? (therapist responds) Because I feel like I'm... not, it's, I feel like it's a combination of playing catch up (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">responds), but also it's also like, I just feel good. I feel like, \"Wow!\" Like, I want the best girl. I don't want just any girl. (therapist responds) Like, I feel like, because I feel so much (chuckles) better, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">So it's a combination of like, making up for lost time, but also just... Now time is fleeting, and I don't want to waste it, just with Iris; well, she's good enough or, you know. I don't know. It's just, it sucks. And then that worries me. I'm like, \"Well, then, I'm never going to settle,\" because I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">constantly... There is this push and pull, but in the meantime, I am getting older, so... (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">You know, there is also... I don't know. All I can think is that maybe part of the reason I'm doing a lot better is because now I know what it's like for people. (therapist responds) This isn't unusual, I think. Even people that... let's say people that were doing great in their (chuckles) 20s, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">fact is, time lost is still time lost, you know? So... This is, I think, you know, I mean, I think about all the people I know who are 40s, 50s, divorced, whatever, or in unhappy marriages or... How the fuck do they feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560556\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">I mean, I'm an independent (chuckles) guy. I have a lot going on. Like, so in a way, I think it's also, it's all those things, but it's also, I think, a general sense of like, I think this is what it feels like sometimes, when you get older, you know. You know, it's not debilitating, it's not (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">responds), you know, but it is just really sad, and like frustrating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It seems like something that you (inaudible) feeling, that makes it more like to wanting to make sure everybody's like, this...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Oh, well, I'm always like that, right? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I just wondered what's, there is something about (blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Just so you don't feel like, so I don't... because then it would be debilitating, I think. Or it would be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah, why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Well, if I felt like, \"This is just me, I'm so traumatized, my life is so unusually fucked up...\" (therapist responds), that's just, that's a lie, man! That's, you have to feel a little bit like you can commiserate with people and, I mean, it's comforting, you know, to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like the two choices, though, are we're all the same or... (blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: No, no, I'm not saying, well, I mean, I know my situation is unique. All I'm saying, though, is other people's situations are also unique, but the common thread is that you can't get time back. (therapist responds) That's what I'm saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Absolutely, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, clearly I have a very unique background, but you know, so does my buddy who got divorced. I don't know. We all have our backgrounds. So all I'm saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: In ways that are particular to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Exactly! But, what we can commiserate on is like, time is gone and somehow (therapist responds) this is just a basic thing of life for every human being, that, you know, you start hitting certain ages (it might be different for different people), but you know, you start feeling it, like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Even thinking about time (inaudible) (blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, you're thinking about time, yeah. That's all, yeah. And so there is something a little more comforting about it. So it's like, I'm like, racing against time and everyone else is (therapist responds) stuck being 30 forever, you know? I mean... (pause) But, yeah, no, it's not a way to minimize. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">I mean, I clearly... I think that's (inaudible) happening. I mean, now that I feel so much better, it's not that hard for me to have these moments where I'm like, \"FUCK!\" Like, I have a very unique set of (chuckles) circumstances. (therapist responds) And that's hard to take, too. You know, it's just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">like, it's like, (inaudible) \"What? Wait, that was me?\" (therapist responds) Like, when I look back on things. I'm like, \"What the fuck happened here?\" You know? That's hard, that's hard to deal with. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">It's like, all the things I would tell someone now, as a life coach, (therapist responds) you know what I mean? That you just get stuck in a drift, you know? Things just happen, and you kind of think some of those things are your choices, or you think you're acting, but you're kind of not. You blink <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">your eyes and ten, fifteen years go by and there you are, you know? So that's, it's devastating. It's a really difficult thing. (pause) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560556\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">[pause 00:11:14 to 00:11:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I think everyone has something that's particular to them that's painful, looking back in their life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or even if it isn't painful, there is still a looking back. (therapist responds) You know what I mean? They could have a completely idyllic whatever, but there is, it's bittersweet, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh, I don't know about completely idyllic. I mean (blocked)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: You know what I mean. I'm just trying to say that even if they've had a pretty good (therapist responds), you know, things have been provided for, overall things have been... not so eventful in a bad way. But there is still a... It is what it is. Suddenly your knee hurts. Suddenly, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">you just lose some of your spark or whatever it might be for people. Or at your job, you're suddenly viewed a little differently, because now there are younger people coming up and now you're... you know? Whatever it is. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">(pause) But yeah. No, no, I mean, there is no question of the vast majority of people, yeah, there are things that they regret or there are things that they... Even if there are things they don't regret, there are things that, in retrospect... there are still... there are questions. Like, people have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">unanswered... you know what I mean? (therapist responds) What happened with that relationship or why, you know, why did I fight with my dad so much all those years? Whatever it is, you know? Or with my siblings or whatever, you know. So I think, yeah, everyone has... something. I think some people are <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">just dealt a little bit more complicated and difficult circumstances. It's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: And something for you, when you get into the particulars of what your circumstances were, at some , it starts to make you feel like you're all alone, and I think it's like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, I think probably everybody... Yeah, I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Or, I guess (inaudible) (blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Because they are so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: ...existential, but like, there is some, like you're uniquely bad in some way or...

Like, it's all so unique to me, it feels so unusual (therapist responds), you know? I mean, everyone's circumstances are unusual, but I feel like, I feel like whatever unusual card you could get, I feel like I got, almost. (therapist responds) Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">I wasn't spared any, you know what I mean? Deaths in the family, being an only child, immigrants, you know like, you name it. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: You got... some of them, rather than one or two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

What...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: I mean, I'm old!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: Like, what's the point of anything? (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Well, a little, no, a little bit, yeah. I mean, it just makes me feel like, \"(sigh) This is a joke!\" I'm still trying to be a musician (ph). I have what, ten really good, vibrant, young years left. Then it's... I'm not middle-aged anymore! I'm becoming an old dude. That's like, it's not, it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">not sinking in, that's what I'm trying to say. You know what I mean? My age right now isn't sinking in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">So, let alone this short span of a decade that I have to still be kind of youthful, a little bit, a tiny bit, which I'm... Even that I'm not, I'm sure I'm deluding myself. I mean, I'm middle aged, you know. So, that's just like, \"What the fuck, man!\" And I'm scrambling to try to finish my first fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">novel! A kid that spent his whole life diligently, you know, willing himself and plotting and writing, trying to... You know, like, it's just, that's hard, that's really hard to swallow. Or someone who's, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">It bumps up against my talents. That's my problem. If I was a different kind of a person, who wasn't so confident in his talents, maybe it would be different. I'd be like, \"Well, that really sucks. And okay, well, now, I'm going my business and...\" I don't feel that way! I feel like I was destined. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">I mean, I have that (chuckles), I have like, an older, maybe an old-school mentality or something. I feel like I was kind of destined to do something important (therapist responds), that leaves a mark, you know what I mean? Not a fucking life coaching business. That's great, there is nothing wrong with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200892\">that, whatever job to make money. Even if I was a professor at Brown, that's, to me, that's not, you know like, I'm talk , in terms of art, that I was somehow destined to kind of move people, and make a little bit more of an impact through writing and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">So it's kind of like, well here I am. I mean, now it's a total race against time (therapist responds) and... It's much harder, not in writing, but in you know, in music, it's much harder because you can be taken less and less seriously. Not seriously, but less and less as a... trendy, you know, \"of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">the moment\" artist, because it's a youth-oriented thing. I mean, you know. It doesn't mean there is not room for you, but it just is what it is. (chuckles) You know what I'm saying? (therapist responds) That's just, it's hard to swallow, it's hard to take that. So that's why I need to feel like other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B2\">people are experiencing similar things, or whatever, that there is somehow, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And kind of buffers them, somehow (ph) (blocked) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Not only buffers, it does make me feel better, because I do realize I don't have children, I'm not in the battle of my life with some fucking ex-wife who's treating me like sh ; I mean, people have it worse. I'm like, I don't think I have it worse than others, but I do have a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">particular set of shitty circumstances (therapist responds) that are not easy to just like... yeah. They're just, you know, it is what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560556\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">(sighs) And again, it's hard to explain that to people. What am I supposed to tell my friends, I feel like I'm destined for great , you know. That sounds a little wacky, you know? But it is how I feel, you know. (pause) It doesn't mean I'm not going to do anything now. I am. It's just... you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200911\">again, it's just like, it's almost, it's one... I think time is kind of like, (chuckles) kind of like death, but it is. It's kind of like, there are really not much you can say about it, you know? Like, if someone loses someone, you can be as sympathetic as you want. In that person's moment, in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200912\">moment, it doesn't matter what you're saying, you know. You can bring the lasagna, you can do whatever the fuck you want. There is nothing you can say. And I think that time is similar. (therapist responds) And that's very difficult. There is nothing to be said. Everyone could be going through exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200913\">the same thing that I'm going through, but if I was to really sit there and really... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) (blocked)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, because it doesn't even make them want to cry or it's like, it's a beyond... It's a very deep kind of black hole type thing, where it's like, I just, there is no... (therapist responds) (pause) So, I think in that case... you know, that's where I think that like... you know, either in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">philosophy, or with life coaching, or... You know, in that way, I think it's a good combo to have like, therapy, but also... It's, I think it's a delicate thing for people like me. You almost have to actively forget, so you can fucking move on and actually have a functioning... But at the same time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200952\">of course, you can't act like things didn't happen. (therapist responds) You have to work... you know what I mean? It's a delicate thing, I think. For me, at least. I think everybody does it their own way, but, for me, I think it's like, you have to sit with it and (inaudible), I mean, you know, it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200953\">is what it is. Like, you have to... work through it. At the same time, you also (chuckles) have enough of you that's energized enough (therapist responds) to focus on the future more and just kind of, you know... not let yourself get... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you're worried about it becoming overwhelming (inaudible) (blocked) immobilizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Well, yeah because that's how people become bitter, it's how they lose energy, it's how they give up on things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: In your family, especially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah! It's how they do things half-assed, it's how they allow themselves, all my life, right? It's how they allow themselves to be scattered, their focus is scattered, you know? (therapist responds) (blows air) So, you know, that worries me. I don't, that's how you don't end up with someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">(therapist responds), you know? Instead of just savoring who you have, you're constantly, something is, you know, because it's all this dark...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: So, I'm going to say something that's a little bit opposite to what you're saying. I was thinking about this yesterday. I hear you saying that the fear is that if you focus too much on lost time, you'll get so depressed and bitter that you get more scattered or more immobilized, don't ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">settle with somebody. But I actually think art should be (ph) opposite has happened. I think it's when you haven't been aware of time that you can afford to be scattered, you don't have to settle down yet, because there are a feeling of endless time. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560556\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. No, I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Because I actually think the more you found time, as sad as it is, the more what you want to do with the time you have has come alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: No, no, it's true. But what I'm saying is so now, now that that's the case (therapist responds), it's like now you have to, there are extremes, you know what I mean? So now the trick is to still be with that, and work through it, and not brush it... \"Oh, like, oh now I'm over it,\" you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A91\">No, of course, it's, I mean, it's completely traumatic. I'm just saying that there has to be a balance of... and I guess it's just what you're saying (therapist affirms), that's what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) (blocked)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: Because I'm doing all these things I'm doing the way I'm kind of doing them is I'm not dwelling, when I'm out in the world, you know what I mean? As much. Like it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you've been dwelling less and less, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I think. The more you've remembered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: Right. Right, right, right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: So I don't think it's going to be that memory causes more of a depression. It causes a lot of grief, but I think as that grief gets really known, so you know, and you get how much time matters, the more you use time differently in the future. You have a lifetime in front of you, in a way. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">(client affirms) Right? There is half your life left, and don't a lot of writers become, only really get into (inaudible) (blocked) starting about now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Or even musicians, yeah. (therapist affirms) I mean, but it doesn't feel that way. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's the problem. (pause) Or it does feel that way, but it also feels like... but all those people are half-fooling themselves a little bit. (therapist responds) In other <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">words, yeah, but they also know that they're old and that... You know what I mean? Like, because what's the alternative? What are you going to do? Like, kill yourself? No! Unless you're... (therapist responds) You know what I mean? Like, if you love life, you know, you want to live your life. But at <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B92\">the same time, it's like you have to play this game with yourself, or... I mean... You know what I'm saying? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">Like, I feel like we have to tell ourselves things a little bit, so that we won't lose our minds. (therapist responds) Like, \"Oh, no, you're 70; you still look great!\" Well, yeah, you do look great, but you are 70, you know? Things are falling apart and you know that you're 70. (therapist responds) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">Your time is very limited. That's an awful, that's a crazy thing to come to terms with. I mean, I think of this doesn't even have to do with my issues. Some of this has to do with just being an artist and (therapist responds) being sensitive and, you know. I think other people know those things and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB2\">they just don't, don't have...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Think about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah like, \"Yeah, we're all going to die. And?\" You know. But I think, if you have a fucked up background and you're an (chuckles) artist, I was already going to think about these things anyway. I thought about these things before anybody in my family died or... you know, so that's a, that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF1\">the tough, it's like, it's... you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560556\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You, I mean, there is certainly the artist side that you're going to feel that, no matter what, (inaudible) even at the end of this, you're going to have that existential feeling and awareness that some people have more or a little bit (ph) less than you. But I think the part that we're tying <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C11\">up (ph), this particular untying (ph) to you, it's not just an artist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">It's waking up to time, after your father having died and this tremendous lapse in time that happened in your life, right? That there is something still right now, about like, as we were talking about the Boston College (ph) yesterday. There is a little piece of, maybe there is endless time, it's still <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">hidden in that like, if, just keep trying a little bit and maybe a year from now, you'll decide that time might run out there, actually. And the more you're aware of that, you might decide you're going to go finish the degree or try to (inaudible) or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">But then it's done with, and you get to move on. You've become less scattered. You move on to the next thing. And it becomes more, the time gets used in a very different way, when it's not timeless. And I think that that's what got, a piece of what got lost in your 20s, especially your 20s, when there <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C51\">was so much trauma and grief going on (on top of whatever else had already been going on), right? That is particular to you. Someone else has a different particular story, but I think it's hard, even to feel a particular feeling (inaudible) associated with that story for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">[pause 00:26:56 to 00:28:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: It's, you know, it's... it sucks, because like, you know, between what I've gone through and the way my family is, what's awful about it is... It's hard... like, no matter what happens, I always still, I have to fight the feeling (therapist responds) that... (pause) like other people just don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C91\">get it, you know what I'm saying? (therapist responds) That like, I still have to fight, I've gotten way better, so that's why I, you know, I mean, it's part of why I've been feeling so much better, but you know, I still have to catch myself in these mom ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">Well, I'll be out, let's say, with friends or whatever. I'll catch myself being the way I used to be, which is like, \"Like, who, who...\" I'll suddenly have this like, \"out of body\" like, kind of thing, you know, this split (snaps fingers) second thing, where I'm like... Like, I don't know how to explain <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">it, (therapist responds) but in a very split (snaps fingers) second thing, I'll just imagine my friend like, as if their life is somehow easier (therapist responds) and, you know what I'm saying? (therapist affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">Like, it's more purposeful or somehow they just, \"How do they do things? Like, how do they...\" You know what I'm saying? (therapist affirms) Like, I'm like, \"Oh, they're going to the beach for the weekend. Like, what's that like?\" (therapist responds) Like, it will seem so weird to me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Foreign...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: ...foreign and strange and... Luckily, it's gotten way better now. I'm like, \"Well, it's really not a big deal to go , they just reserved the place and then they went,\" you know. But that, I think that will be a good, as that improves... because that's been a big thing. I mean, that's why <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D11\">like... Now when I'm with people, I feel so much... something just feels different, you know? I just feel more connected, kind of, and more mellow, internally more mellow, you know? Um...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560556\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Less of an outsider. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: Less of an outsider, less internally needy kind of.

(therapist responds) But that is a hard thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D51\">because, and I think that's what happens with women, too. Like, they just seem so foreign like, not, you know, it's just like, what, \"They're not going to get me. They don't... what... what's she talking about, her family vacations in Newfoundland. What is that?\" Like (chuckles) it just seems completely foreign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">And so now luckily I catch myself. Like, that's just crazy family talking. (therapist responds) What does that mean? I'm foreign to them. (therapist affirms) My experience is not their experience. I mean, what does that even mean? It's just another way of, it's like my mom's, you know, thing of like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D71\">\"It's us against the world. Like, we're unique. Anything that happens...\" You know what I mean? (therapist affirms) It's like a little bit narcissistic. It's like, even your bad shit is special. It's only you (therapist responds), you know? It is particular to you, but it doesn't mean, it's not a competition, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D72\">or it's not like a, you know, only bad things happen to you. No one else gets it, or you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: (pause) Or maybe even how could I be saying some of these things.

(pause) No, no it's my family. It's totally my family. It's my mom, especially. (therapist responds) I mean, she did it... I'll give you a small example. Yesterday, or the day before, I don't know, my uncle was over for a little bit. They were <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">going to take, he and my mom were taking my grandmother again for her dentures and all that. (therapist responds) Later that night, I popped down, I brought Cecelia (sp) down so, you know, and I want to see how, what happened with my grandmother, or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">Like, for no reason, you know (therapist responds), it's so my mom. Like, she was like, you know, she kind of laughs, she was like, \"You know, I drove, I was driving by, whatever, and your uncle was at the coffee shop, you know...\" At the Cheshire coffee shop, these Assyrian dudes get together. It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E11\">kind of pathetic, but, you know, and my uncle doesn't have friends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">So he hangs out with my aunt, who passed away, her hus , you know, my uncle, who's like, you know, 78, 79. And these Assyrian dudes at the coffee shop, and you know. And like, I literally was like, \"Well, like, so what, Mom?\" Why... but she's saying that, because she's trying to say like, \"They're <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E31\">sitting there and they're...\" Like, she's trying to say something, you know what I mean? That's my mom, always does shit like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">Like, because, who, what is the point of that? (therapist responds) I know that Uncle goes to... I mean, he can go wherever he wants. He's living his life. I don't... And yes, he goes to the coffee shop, and yes, he goes with your dad's sister's...

All the broads in the family do that. They've all, my, you know, God rest her soul, but my aunt who passed away used to do that, my mom does it, the other aunt does it. The only person who doesn't do it is my fucking grandmother, you know? So I don't know if my grandpa, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E71\">it's like this kind of... angry something, you know, something is going on, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Destructive envy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">CLIENT: And of what? What's the envy? They're a bunch of bozos, sitting at a coffee shop, talking about what's happening in geopolitics. What? Like, that's what, you know... It's just, I don't know. I don't know. That's a very negative, negative... It's a waste of brain... like, who cares? I just don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB1\">care. I literally do not care. But what I've hated about that is, you can say you don't care as much as you want, but when you're a kid, growing up, you cannot care that maybe you're not like that. But your parent is, it affects you. Then you do start, you catch yourself in moments, where like, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB2\">know, you start feeling... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">CLIENT: You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yes, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">CLIENT: You start feeling res , my uncle, they're going to the beach and... you know.

And also, the thing is, I mean I've told her this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F31\">but she, you can't change people who are like, in their 70s. It's like, \"You're doing yourself a disservice,\" (therapist responds) you know what I mean? Her new thing... I've told her a million times... We'll be talking, if my uncle asks me how this life-coaching thing is going, my mom inevitably brings <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F32\">up his wife.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">\"Oh, so, you said I can refer people, clients to you?\" And I'm like, \"Mom, these things have nothing to do with each other. Janice (ph) deals with ill people, medically sick people, all right? Just don't...\" But she has to feel like... \"Oh, my son's doing some... He's going to have an office!\" Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F51\">for her it's a big thing, to have an office, you know? It's like, \"Dude! That's just some, that's just pathetic.\" You know? And you're just annoying people. They're being nice, they're not saying anything, but it's just pathetic, you know.
