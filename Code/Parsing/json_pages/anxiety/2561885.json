I was panicking as I came back. I mentally somehow got myself not to panic last night and then today it was okay until I was trying to do the dishes and then there was all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">a sudden no water pressure and I was not able to do the last few of them. Eventually, I realized if I put on cold water . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you ran out of hot water?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I ran out of hot water. There was a little bit left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: The hot water will replenish, but you probably used up the hot water tank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Oh, that would explain it. I thought it was just that I was getting really bad water pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Separate handles for hot and cold?  So it sounds like what happens, and I\u2019m not a plumber by any means, but in my experience you used up the hot water that you had available in the hot water tank. If you have a separate valve for hot and cold, then you ought to have water pressure and you\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">have water. It\u2019s not that you used up water, it\u2019s just that you used up the hot water. And then that takes some time and the water tank will heat the new water available. It just takes a little bit of time. So when you go home today you\u2019ll probably have a full tank of hot water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: That would explain it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So when it happens to you for the first time and it\u2019s a new place and you don\u2019t know what the system is like, it can be unsettling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I was just like how am I going to do my dishes and I have leftover pasta that I can\u2019t eat because I don\u2019t have a microwave and I can\u2019t even eat leftovers. I want to be all good about cooking stuff and productive and thoughtful and I can\u2019t be responsible because I don\u2019t even have a space in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">apartment for a microwave.  Then I can\u2019t make leftovers. (crying) I still haven\u2019t conquered my oven yet and I was cleaning it out with oven cleaner first. Sydney said he\u2019d help me with that but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: So when you get really panicked, which it sounds like immediately when something started going wrong or something was unexpected, you started to really panic and it\u2019s much harder to think logically and it\u2019s harder to think creatively and problem solve when you\u2019re panicking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I just want to be able to deal with my apartment. I tried to distract myself. I tried to find the rainbow wool and I couldn\u2019t find it. I went through like ten of those bins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s another frustration on top of already feeling . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I wanted to be able to spin it and now I\u2019m like maybe I have to buy rainbow wool, which seems kind of ridiculous considering I should have all the wool ever. Seriously, I have old stock from my store that I\u2019m not selling right now. I should not have to go out and buy rainbow wool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: But you can\u2019t find it right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t find it. That took forever, getting those in and out, and there were some boxes in the way and it was trapped in the closet. (crying) I need to be able to learn how to calm down and deal with it because I know I\u2019m stuck with this apartment for the next seven months and I don\u2019t know how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">to deal with it on a day-to-day basis that I can just not feel horrible. I ordered a poster to put in my room because I thought part of it was the room with the wall being so bare, so I\u2019ll put the poster up when it comes.  I don\u2019t know if that will really help.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it will help with one of the issues, but it does sound like the thing with the water doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s a new problem. You might have to, if you ever have a big load of dishes to wash again, you know that you might not get through it all with really hot water. The space <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">issue is an ongoing issue and figuring out how to configure your space, how to make the best use of the space that you have so that you can do the things you need to do to take care of yourself, that\u2019s the ongoing problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Has your mom or dad come to the apartment with you and looked at the space with you? Have they helped you to problem solve that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: They haven\u2019t helped me problem solve yet. They were going to come up yesterday, but then the forecast made it so she didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if them seeing it with fresh eyes might help you to see if there are ways that you can arrange things or things that you can do to make it a little bit easier to do some of the things your finding difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I know Sydney has repeatedly said that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem and just that, him contradicting you, doesn\u2019t feel helpful. But maybe having a fresh set of eyes help arrange or problem solve might feel helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Maybe. The last time they were up they could only be there for a little bit because dad had a football game to get to. He was watching it with a friend on TV. Maybe if they came back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Would you be open to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I would be. I don\u2019t know what else to do. If I can trick myself into thinking the space is bigger then . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: More functional. You can\u2019t make the space bigger, but you can make it more functional. I haven\u2019t seen the space, but I would hope that there are ways you can kind of make the best use out of it that you can. And with boxes in the way of things, it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s at that point yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, not so much. The boxes are only in the living room and the closet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That makes it hard to get at anything that\u2019s stored in the closet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t usually use the closets, but that\u2019s true. It is hard to get to things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: If the boxes weren\u2019t there, maybe you could.  Maybe that closet could become something that\u2019s actually adaptive if there is a way for you to get in and out with things that you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t know when my parents could come up. Maybe next weekend. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: So you said being there was mostly okay but started to drive Sydney crazy. It didn\u2019t feel like a viable alternative anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Talk me through that. What was good? What was bad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: He was having issues with the whole lack of privacy thing. My parents say if I were to live there they would pick up the basement so I could live in the basement.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You or you two?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Me. I think Sydney could come over as much as he wanted to. It isn\u2019t a problem. There is the privacy issue, which I guess wouldn\u2019t be an issue because I would live in the basement, but there is also the . . .  Well actually, even then, in the basement the laundry machine is in the basement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: It wouldn\u2019t be a separate apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. Also the cat\u2019s litter box is in there so they keep the door closed for that. One of the two cats, I don\u2019t know which one, one of them or maybe even both of them can\u2019t go to the bathroom without a significant amount of light in there, which seems counterintuitive for cats, since they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">supposed to be able to see in really low light. Then having that door open with the light in there is making it harder to sleep. Also, he felt trapped by being in suburbia \u2013 not really \u2013 even though Stamford is a city. But not having all the public transportation or the ability to go wherever he wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">easily, especially when I have the car because when I have the car he can take the T.  At my parents\u2019 place he can\u2019t really do anything so it makes it really not a viable option. Getting a new apartment would not be a viable option either at this point. Maybe if we moved in a little bit earlier in September <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200633\">I could shave off a little bit of time there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: But moving is also a big hassle and something that creates a lot of stress for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: But it would be a temporary, one-time hassle and once it was over, it would be over. It wouldn\u2019t go on for several months like this. I guess it would take some time to pack everything up, but I can get rid of more stuff then it won\u2019t be as bad as the move from the old, old place because at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">all the yarn is in containers now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t fully unpacked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: That, too. I\u2019ve unpacked a lot of stuff. I\u2019ve unpacked the majority of it, but I guess I\u2019m not planning on unpacking any of my books or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not planning on unpacking them because there is no space for them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: There is space; it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t really committed to staying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: My lease is up in August. I just don\u2019t think it would be wise for me to do a one-year lease. I think Sydney and I are going to move in together. But even if we weren\u2019t, I would probably move home or do something else, but I don\u2019t think I can stay here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Beyond August.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, considering how miserable this apartment is making me.  I just don\u2019t know how I misjudged it so much when I viewed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: It certainly wasn\u2019t something that you talked about at all. You were excited about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: But then it was smaller than I thought. I guess I forgot about how small the kitchen was. (sobbing) I want out so much and I don\u2019t know if I should be asking . . . My parents might be able to afford . . . I can\u2019t afford two apartments. I can\u2019t and I don\u2019t know. (crying) I need out. It\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">driving me so crazy. It seems like no matter what, just doing little things is like rearranging the chairs on the Titanic or something. It seems like I\u2019m trying to fix small problems when there is still the big problem of this apartment driving me crazy. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: The question here is how does an apartment get that much power? The problem with the Titanic was that it was sinking and people can\u2019t breathe underwater. How is it that the size of an apartment gets as much power as a huge sinking boat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Because I can\u2019t get to my stuff. I can\u2019t even eat. It\u2019s impacting the way I live my life in terms of eating habits and stuff. (crying) It\u2019s because I can\u2019t have a microwave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t or nobody could?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if anyone could. Maybe. Maybe if I put it on top of the frig, but then I wouldn\u2019t really be able to reach it. Someone taller than me might be able to reach a microwave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: I guess I didn\u2019t mean specifically the microwave, but you can\u2019t make a meal in that kitchen or nobody possibly can make a meal? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: I can make a meal, but I can\u2019t make leftovers. So that means I have to cook something new each time. We made pasta last night and there is leftover pasta and I can\u2019t do anything with the leftover pasta.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t heat it in boiling water?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Wouldn\u2019t that overcook it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You leave it in long enough to get hot. What did people do before there were microwaves?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: They didn\u2019t eat leftovers or they ate cold food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: They heated them up in other ways. Part of this is rather than resigning yourself to an uncomfortable fate, getting creative. If you want to heat up leftover pasta, it\u2019s going to take longer than a microwave, right? A microwave is super easy. You press a minute, start, the food is warm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Plus you have to do more dishes then if you have to rewash the pot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yes. So it\u2019s not the easiest way; but rather than letting yourself be trapped in an impossible situation, you have to create something different. So yeah, if you want to heat up leftover pasta you can do that without the sauce on it. Save it without sauce. Boil some water. Leave the pasta <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">in there long enough to get warm \u2013 you\u2019re not recooking it; you\u2019re just reheating it \u2013 and drain it. It\u2019s going to take a little bit longer, but you can still have it. You don\u2019t need to be denied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: The other solution was to bring it to work where I do have a microwave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Sure. Then you can have leftovers for lunch. That\u2019s another way. That way it\u2019s a way to get two meals out of something without necessarily the extra work.  Part of having your parents look at the space or taking to me about it or looking at it through Sydney\u2019s perspective \u2013 because the apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">is not driving him crazy, and yet he has another apartment to go to.  It\u2019s not the lease that he signed. But if we can think how somebody else would respond to it who isn\u2019t feeling as emotionally upset about it, looking at it as a practical challenge rather than an emotional sentence \u2013 because it sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200992\">to me like you feel like this apartment is a death sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: It kind of feels it is. (crying) It makes me so sad on a regular basis and I just can\u2019t keep on being this sad all the time. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I agree. You cannot live this sad. The piece of the equation that we want to change is how you feel; and if you can\u2019t change the apartment, then we need to change something else, which is how you respond to the apartment. That\u2019s the only piece it sounds like you have a lot of control over <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">because if living with your parents now sounds like it\u2019s not a viable option, then we have to find a way for staying in this apartment until August not to be such a death sentence. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: The only thing I can think of is not being in my apartment as often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: So taking some breaks from it might be a good tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: I wanted to go to Sydney\u2019s place last night and we were going to, but then he was like \u201cwhy don\u2019t we just go tomorrow?\u201d (sobbing) Then this all happened and I was stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I think your response is probably on two things. One was that you were in the apartment that you don\u2019t like. But also that it doesn\u2019t feel like your choice. You wanted to go to Sydney\u2019s place and he said no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: He said yes, but later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: So he said yes, but later. So two things happened: You lost control. You didn\u2019t get control of when. He got control of when and you felt unhappy in the apartment.  That control piece, feeling trapped in the apartment, feeling very dependent upon Sydney\u2019s permission to do things, his ability <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">to do things with you, both of those things have an effect on how you feel. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: (crying) Just calm down and not have to go crazy over it like a normal person should be calm. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re having a really intense reaction to this move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been there a month now and it hasn\u2019t gotten any better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: No, it hasn\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Even though I have unpacked some things and now I have a table. It doesn\u2019t end. (crying) It never ends and I just want to move on and make it all go away. (sobbing) Maybe I should live with my parents anyway even though it doesn\u2019t seem like it would be viable with Sydney. Maybe I should break <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">up with Sydney so I can live with my parents and then I can live with my parents and I won\u2019t be in the apartment anymore and I won\u2019t have to deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Can you live with your parents without breaking up with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. I would see him less often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t know. It does seem like I should be able to take care of myself, but it\u2019s hard to do with the apartment. I don\u2019t feel like I have the space to take care of myself. I don\u2019t know how someone lived in this apartment for two years and didn\u2019t go crazy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: So the person who lived there with you stayed two years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: I think he lived there maybe less than that. Maybe he stayed there one year, but he stayed a while. Maybe he ate a lot of take-out. I don\u2019t remember him having a microwave. Maybe he did. Maybe it was in the living room area instead of the kitchen area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: I guess if I could find a stand to put something on maybe I could get a microwave in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Even just a tray table, if that would make it feel more manageable to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Have you talked to your psychiatrist in the past couple of weeks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m seeing her on the 21st. I probably should. I don\u2019t know. I wonder if that new med is a problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Certainly you\u2019ve now had several weeks of very intense emotions. You\u2019ve been feeling very defeated, very hopeless, really panicky for a couple of weeks now. We can trace the trigger to moving into this apartment, which was such a disappointment to you, but you haven\u2019t accommodated to that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">and I think that\u2019s something that you want to talk to the psychiatrist about because we\u2019re working to problem solve, but you\u2019re having a hard time doing that. It\u2019s hard to get out of the thought loops that are intensifying your response. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t know what else I can do with the drugs. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know the answer to that either, which is why I wondered if you had been able to consult with your psychiatrist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I can try calling her. I just don\u2019t know. The drugs seem kind of hopeless, too, because there are only so many things you can do. I can\u2019t take anything that affects the serotonin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You have certainly had much reduced symptoms compared to what\u2019s going on now in the past. That might not be a drug issue.  Maybe there is; maybe there isn\u2019t some adjustment that can be made. It\u2019s certainly worth checking into because it sounds like some of the problem-solving stuff you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">been trying to use in trying to think in a more creative, flexible way is really hard for you to do and it\u2019s having minimal effect. You want all those pieces working together. You want the flexible thoughts working to help you, the meds working to help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Maybe this apartment is just so livable and maybe anyone would say that, you know? Maybe I really am in the worst apartment ever. I guess it\u2019s not the worst apartment ever because I saw worse apartments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And people are renting them. You had a really hard time getting an apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Sometimes I thought I would have someone look over my lease, but I could see about breaking it maybe. Maybe I would even find a new one, but something else would have to be for a year or something and I don\u2019t think I could find another \u2013 maybe if I found a sublet or something like that and subletted <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">mine. It seems like it would be another temporary move for another one. It just seems so not worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: How were things feeling for you when you were out of the apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: A lot better, although right now today I\u2019ve been feeling tense. I brought my laptop with me because I thought I was going to work on cover letter stuff, except I feel completely not up to that now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: What changed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess everything today is sort of feeling like in a haze and I\u2019m having trouble seeing. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re having trouble seeing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: A little bit. Things were a little bit blurry for a while. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. (crying) I can\u2019t explain it. It wasn\u2019t for that long. Of course, I still have the weight of the laptop that I\u2019m carrying even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get anything out of it. I carried it for nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">and I guess I feel frustrated with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: What would you need to put yourself in a frame of mind where you could write a cover letter, rather than giving up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Leave my stuff over at Sydney\u2019s place and be staying there and not be staying at my place. I really do think I need to be not staying at my place and being there and having my stuff still there is a huge part of the panic. It doesn\u2019t make sense, but I think that\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: No, it doesn\u2019t. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: I just need to calm down and relax by not being at my place, and then I could write one. Maybe. Knowing I\u2019m going back to my place is hanging over my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: So being able to focus, having some control over where you can focus your thoughts \u2013 because it seems like what\u2019s happening, no matter what you\u2019re talking about, the place where you turn your thoughts to is \u201cI hate my place; I need to be out of there and nothing will be okay unless I\u2019m out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">of my place.\u201d  It\u2019s like that\u2019s the train that your thoughts want to go on and being able to turn and take control and say, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m focusing on right now. Yes, I acknowledge that I hate my place. I don\u2019t want to live there anymore. I want to be out, but that\u2019s not where I\u2019m going to focus <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F12\">right now. Right now I\u2019m focusing on reading the requirements for this job and crafting a cover letter that addresses how I fit.\u201d So it\u2019s not pretending that you like your place or that it\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not allowing that to be the only thing that takes up the focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: Okay. I just don\u2019t think I can do that right now. (pause)  I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: I believe you. I believe that you feel like you can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: I want to. I brought my laptop. I\u2019m also just feeling like lugging around too much stuff isn\u2019t helping. Maybe if I just brought my laptop or had emptied my backpack of all the things that I normally carry around because I carry around all my meds in my backpack because then I bring it to my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">place or to Sydney\u2019s place or to my parents\u2019 place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Without having to repack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: So it seems like the thread here and the pattern that I hear in your thoughts is that you feel like you need to have things the way that you ideally would want them in order to be able to be effective at anything. In order to be able to work, you need to not be frustrated by what you\u2019re carrying <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">around. You need to not dislike your place. This belief that you need to have things be the way that you want things in order to be able to do something is really getting in your way because a lot of the time things aren\u2019t the way that we want them.  They might not even be close to the way we want them, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD2\">but yet we still have to find a way to function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t think those people are living in apartments that make them miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: No, a large part of the population is homeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Okay, but then they\u2019re not getting stuff done if they are homeless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: They might be getting a lot of stuff done. It\u2019s not a comparison. Some people have it worse than you; some people have it easier than you. The comparison game doesn\u2019t help you. This is your reality. Your reality is that you have an apartment that you don\u2019t like. Your choice is are you going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">to allow that reality that you don\u2019t like your apartment, that it\u2019s challenging in many ways, are you going to let that force you into living the next however many months like this?  Or are you going to face some of the challenges that are there and be functional anyway? We could list a whole host of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201052\">people who are living in more challenging circumstances and a whole host of people that are living in much less challenging circumstances, but that\u2019s not going to change what\u2019s happening for you. The only thing that\u2019s going to change what\u2019s happening for you is if we can find a way for you to respond <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201053\">to your challenges in a way that helps you rather than further traps you in them. It seems like this past month you\u2019ve been really trapped. You\u2019ve said a couple of things today that have potential to get you sort of untrapped \u2013 thinking about being able to stay with your parents sometimes and not others <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201054\">is a way of having that escape you so desperately want. Even bringing your laptop with you today was a great way of thinking \u201chere is a way of getting out of the apartment and work on something I need to do.\u201d  It is challenging, having to lug around all the stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: That, plus I have no clue what to write in the cover letter. If I had a clue what to write in the cover letter, maybe it would be easier to get over the other challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure it would, but you\u2019ve written other cover letters. You\u2019ve written lots of cover letters. You\u2019ve done this before and you can do it again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m kind of out of practice.

I expect myself to curl up in a little ball and cry for the rest of the day possibly. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Then that\u2019s probably what\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019ll probably meet your own expectation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.  Maybe I can get something done.

I can\u2019t really go to his place without him and I guess I could, but that would be weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: Would he be supportive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I think he wants to get out, but he didn\u2019t really get to sleep until really, really late last night so I let him sleep in so we\u2019d have this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: So so much of what happens to you in your day is about Sydney.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019d feel frustrated by that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah. I am frustrated that I just couldn\u2019t get over to his place like I wanted to. (crying) Also, when I was trying to go to sleep he wanted to use the computer and told me, eventually, that he would go to the living room and use the computer there.  He was using it on the bed next to me and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">the light was making it really hard for me to go to bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re also tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: A little, I guess. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m having trouble seeing. Whatever. I am tired. Maybe I should take a nap or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: Maybe you should go to bed early. Sleep on the schedule that makes sense to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: But early, like I want to go to bed now, I think. I don\u2019t think I could go to bed now because that would make my schedule really messed up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s probably best for you to go to bed at a normal bedtime so that you can get good, consolidated sleep at night and then be on schedule for the day. Sometimes taking a short nap is really useful, but I think having a regular pattern is actually most useful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just been so hard to get sleep lately because I\u2019ve been waking up a zillion times to go to the bathroom and I\u2019ve talked to the doctor about this issue and stuff but it hasn\u2019t been fixed yet. I wake up and feel like I have to go even when I don\u2019t and then I\u2019m just sitting there and not being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">able to go back to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2012E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t know about that. That\u2019s been going on for a while?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah, to varying degrees.  It used to be just getting up once in the middle of the night, but last night it was maybe five or six times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Is that happening during the day as well or only at night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: Only at night. I may have to go to the bathroom a little bit more often during the day, but not like that. No. I don\u2019t know why. Last night and the night before was really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019ve talked to the doctor about it and they couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Originally we thought it was the UTI, but then they gave me antibiotics and it hasn\u2019t gone away. They think it\u2019s the whole being pre-diabetic. It might be that. Other than losing weight, there is nothing I can do about it immediately, so I\u2019m just forced to get less sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re getting interrupted sleep.  Being sleep deprived, which can be a function of how many hours your sleeping, but also how restful that sleep is, gives you less of the tolerance for things that are frustrating. It also tends to have people have more intensity in their emotions and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D1\">react stronger to things. So also knowing that you\u2019ve been having this ongoing problem for the past couple of months starts to explain part of why you\u2019re having such a hard time accommodating to this change and the stressor of your apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Except that there\u2019s nothing that I can do about it and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: Sometimes understanding why you\u2019re feeling the way you\u2019re feeling. If it makes sense that you\u2019re responding more strongly because there is some ongoing sleep deprivation, then we need to understand that the response is not just due to the apartment, but a combination of things \u2013 the apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201411\">and a lowered ability to deal with any kind of frustration or crisis or disappointment.  All that you\u2019re going to have a stronger response to, so we need to think about that because then maybe changing something about the apartment or even where you live is not going to have as much as an impact as <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201412\">you\u2019re imagining it will. Sometimes when you think about \u201cwell, I\u2019ll just move to another apartment,\u201d what if that\u2019s not the magic cure? What if you\u2019re going to find something else to be upset about? Obviously, staying in touch with your doctors to see if there is something that you can do about this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201413\">but also if you know that your sleep is going to be interrupted, that makes it even more important to be able to get to bed at a reasonable hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: I have been getting to bed at a reasonable hour most of the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just the staying in bed part. When I can, I try to build in extra sleep there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: That sounds like a good response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: It just hasn\u2019t been working the way I wanted to. Last night and the night before it was so awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: So two nights in a row it\u2019s been really awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And right now I have my period, so that doesn\u2019t help either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: That makes it a particularly difficult day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: I just want the day to be over and I just want to go to sleep because then I don\u2019t have to deal with anything. (crying) The thing is, I\u2019m usually fine when I\u2019m at work. I\u2019m far enough away from everything. It doesn\u2019t matter about my apartment anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20152-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20152-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561885\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">THERAPIST: It feels good to be out and being productive. I wonder if it would also feel good to be out and doing things that are not \u2013 the work is one great place. What about when you\u2019re out and doing something \u2013running an errand or have you taken any walks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">CLIENT: I walked to get to the station to get here, so a 20-minute walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: How does that feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t feel sleep deprived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: You were carrying a lot of stuff. There\u2019s a difference between talking a walk, lugging your stuff, and taking a walk for exercise where you might not bring such heavy things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: It might feel a little bit more freeing if you were taking a walk and just carrying your keys and your phone, but not all this other stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah, I should try that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: You talked about needing to get out and needing to have a break; and getting out permanently \u2013 whether by moving or staying with your parents is one thing \u2013 but something you can definitely do is giving yourself frequent breaks by just taking a 15-minute walk. Even on a cold day you can go <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201651\">out for 15 minutes or get a change of scenery someplace to give yourself less dramatic breaks, but a break nonetheless from the space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: The problem is there aren\u2019t really any coffee stores nearby that I could easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t necessarily have to walk to a place.

It\u2019s a break. It\u2019s not a permanent solution; it\u2019s a break. It\u2019s not the ideal thing. It\u2019s not the ideal solution that you want, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s worthless. If there is one trick that you could take away from today\u2019s session it would be not to discard something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201711\">has a little bit of use just because it\u2019s not the perfect solution. I know you want that perfect solution. I think it makes all the bad stress go away. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to come by that, but you probably can take advantage of things that give you some belief. I would love for you to not throw <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201712\">those out because they\u2019re not total relief.  That\u2019s the flip side of not allowing yourself to do something because it\u2019s not idea. You can do stuff even when it\u2019s not ideal and you can take advantage of a little bit of relief, even though it\u2019s not total relief.

That\u2019s the important thing being safe to yourself, that you\u2019re not going to hurt yourself as your means of escape.  If you feel like you are going to do that then know who <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201811\">you\u2019re going to call.
