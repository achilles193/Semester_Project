I have another three weeks before I have to pay dues for the semester if I want to sing with them. So that was good. My friend Jodie went with me. Jodie also goes by another <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">name. [ph] I can\u2019t remember which name I used in here to talk about her or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: The person I\u2019m thinking of is Jodie. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s dating\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So yeah, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to continue singing with the chorus because her mystery hunt team won by mistake this year, which means they have to write next year\u2019s hunt. [1:05] Everyone wants to come in second place at mystery hunt. No one actually wants to win because winning <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">is a lot of work. But she\u2019s going to be super busy, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to sing in the chorale. But it seems like a congenial group. No one was mean about my lack of sight singing skills, so I\u2019m going to try. We\u2019ll see how it goes. I really love chorale music, and I\u2019m really sad that my church <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">choir is being so blah. So yeah, there\u2019s that. I\u2019m going on a silent retreat this weekend, which was unreservedly a good thing last year. I\u2019m a little nervous this year because the last week has been kind of an emotional roller coaster. I had fewer external stressers at this time last year, but hopefully <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">it will be good and hopefully it will give my brain a reset. [2:07] I am not taking any electronics with me. (pause) After the rehearsal last night, Jodie came over to my place to have some tea. There\u2019s\u2026 there was a kickstarter. So Helen, [ph] who\u2019s a musician I admire; I wouldn\u2019t call her a friend; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">we\u2019re not\u2026 we don\u2019t actually know each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I remember Helen. [ph]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: She\u2019s friends with friends of mine. A friend of hers is starting\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Does she live in New Jersey or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Nebraska. But a friend of hers was starting a company selling tea, flavored tea, and so she ran a Kickstarter to fund her next step in her business. And so she made 16 flavors of tea based off of... inspired by Helen\u2019s [ph] music. [3:06] So Jodie came over after rehearsal last night to sample <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">a bunch of Helen [ph] teas. And she and Dave totally ganged up on me and told me that I\u2019m being utterly ridiculous about this woman I have a crush on, that I should ask her out and be done with it instead of pining, which they\u2019re probably right, but that\u2019s scary. (pause) Dave in particular is very confused <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">that I\u2019m not being more bold about just telling people when I like them because I used to be. [4:13] The way Dave and I started dating the first time, we were walking to class together. I just turned to him in the middle of the hallway on campus and was like so are you just going to continue flirting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">with me outrageously forever or are we going to go on a date sometime. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m more cautious and that I no longer have the sense of well I\u2019ve got nothing to lose or if it\u2019s a bad thing in that I\u2019m becoming more fearful [inaudible] I\u2019m not sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: My hunch is it\u2019s more to do with being in touch with the sense of risk and hurt that can happen. [inaudible] you sort of [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562012\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. But yeah, she was friends with a bunch of my friends. And if things get weird then I don\u2019t know. [5:58] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s why I [inaudible] Maybe there\u2019s a way that you\u2019re always doing kickstarters, sort of putting things out there and waiting to see. Like last night with Dave and Jodie they were like no, what are you doing, you\u2019ve got to\u2026 that kind of\u2026 they were into it. They were backing you up. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">[inaudible] like that feels really nice, and it at least makes it easier and better to contemplate doing something, whatever you decide to do. [7:39] Is that there\u2019s, I don\u2019t know how it came about but I had the thought that maybe in some way there\u2019s a little bit of a kickstarter, like do you date this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">person, is there enough interest\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: \u2026from them to help you. (pause) And maybe a little [inaudible] too. I don\u2019t know, is this a step forward, is it a step backward, where are we, where am I, am I getting better or worse. (pause) And I imagine it could make you worry you\u2019re doing something wrong, which is not at all where I\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">what I mean. But I understand that\u2026 I guess I\u2019m thinking about it more as you wanting and really appreciating the support. It feels really nice. And it helps with things that are hard to do. [9:00] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: She really is brilliant, this person I have a crush on. She\u2019s incredibly smart, interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s her first name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Lucy [ph].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. This is Lucy from [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I didn\u2019t realize I had a crush on her until I realized I had spent three days of [inaudible] doing nothing but following her around. [11:01] And then I went oh. Well that explains why I spend all of my time at the conn [ph] with her and her pack of nerdy [inaudible] instead of the people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">I normally hang out with. I am sometimes not in touch with my feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Didn\u2019t take you that long. (pause) What\u2019s on your mind? [14:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Oh I was thinking about [inaudible] how I don\u2019t feel up for the challenge, or up to the challenge. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I wonder if in your sort of lower or more self-hating moments you can feel a little like Medusa.
