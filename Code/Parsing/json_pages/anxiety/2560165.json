I think I\u2019ve been (inaudible 00:08) the protocol, as we call it, and it\u2019s actually worked out a lot better than in the past where I would, you know, fall into maybe a somewhat routine pattern of, you know, bringing back up the thought again and not answering the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">question. But, you know, since the last session, I\u2019ve been, you know, really good at just focusing on what we talked about, what we wanted to practice. There\u2019s only been a couple times where I caught myself going down the route of getting into repetition, and I just kind of would stop that. And then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">actually, the frequency of (pause) thoughts coming up, it seems like it\u2019s being (ph) less too. So maybe it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Drat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Less practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Less practice. So, oddly enough, it hasn\u2019t I think, maybe, you know, sticking to the protocol, from what I can analyze, it helping the frequency go down because you\u2019re not getting I\u2019m not getting stuck in a pattern as much. So either way, whatever is working seems to be working, which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">good. I\u2019m not going to really dive too deep into questioning why. I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Well, let me back up to the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: You said you were able to interrupt the repetition and think (ph). Do you know what drives that repetition? Do you I mean, is there a message that you think you\u2019re receiving or as though you\u2019re getting a message that says it\u2019s important to do this or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I think the times I\u2019ve noticed it was if the way I\u2019m rethinking the thought or not answering the question feels, I don\u2019t know, odd to me or different. It would kind of almost, for a moment, catch me back in the old times, where I would, you know, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t clear that correctly.\u201d Where now <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">I try to if I notice that, I\u2019ll maybe say some different way, so it\u2019s not always the same, so I\u2019m not falling into a complete compulsive pattern, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: So it goes back to, \u201cI didn\u2019t clear it well (ph).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Sort of. Sort of, yeah. But I caught myself just a couple times. I noticed, like, okay, no, that\u2019s not what I want to do, so I maybe practiced, you know, saying it, like, a little different way. Or even if it didn\u2019t feel, in the old way, cleared, I would just move on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I like how you said it a few minutes ago, which is, I\u2019m, you know, I\u2019m not going to delve into very deeply about this. It\u2019s whatever\u2019s working is working. And I think that\u2019s a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Just stick with the protocol and don\u2019t have to worry about analysis and anything. Just stay you just work it, you know. You just work the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So I haven\u2019t had as much practice as the week in Dallas, because I thought that was kind of a bad week. But I feel like since we talked last, I was able to practice a more effective way of dealing with those, you know, compulsive thoughts or behaviors. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Anything frustrating? Any particular time of day or type of event that is more -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I think I noticed a little bit of an old, like [I don\u2019t know] (ph), the first or second session, I touched on and I don\u2019t know if this is part of the compulsive behavior, but there\u2019s times when, you know, my wife might say or do something and I\u2019ll feel like she didn\u2019t say it in a nice enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">way or, you know, I questioned if she\u2019s mad about something or upset. If, like, sometimes if there\u2019s more of those feelings, then it tends to lead me more into those thoughts. So if there\u2019s less of me feeling like she\u2019s, you know, stressing me out or making me anxious, then there\u2019s less of those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Wait. Say that last sentence again. If there\u2019s less\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: If there\u2019s less things I\u2019m feeling anxious about, because if my wife said or did or whatever, I feel like there\u2019s less negative repulsive thoughts that come up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Okay, and what\u2019s the opposite of that? There\u2019s more (pause) what? There\u2019s more questioning of what her tone of voice was or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Or I can\u2019t quite interpret. I kind of got a sense that that was a signal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. So it\u2019s like if there\u2019s more of that, there\u2019s more of the other. So if there\u2019s less upfront, then they\u2019ll be less of the latter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And so did you have some brushes with \u201cI wonder what she meant by that\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure she really was honest when she said she was sorry\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I can\u2019t really pinpoint it, but sometimes [both of] (ph) my parents were here this weekend for Thanksgiving. Actually, they were here for a whole week, and we had a lot of good times Sometimes it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s almost like if you\u2019d say something in conversation to my parents like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">whether it was positive, negative, whatever I\u2019d kind of catch myself thinking, like, \u201cWell, I wonder why she said that. Like, I would have rather had her say this instead or react this way.\u201d And I\u2019m kind of like, \u201cWait, no. She\u2019s her own person and I shouldn\u2019t be thinking how she should react to something.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">And I felt myself a little bit, you know, bothered by something whether it was, like I said, negative or positive or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Now, do you think that was an OCD moment? Or do you think that was, like, something else? Like, I mean, did you feel a little annoyed at her for having -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to tell. I don\u2019t know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: That could be just marriage, in terms of, you know, she\u2019s reflecting me and if she says it this way, they might -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s what (ph) was hard for me to tell. I didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s an OCD thing or if it was just part of my (pause) behavior and perception, where\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well, would have happened next, if you hadn\u2019t checked yourself? Then what would have gone on mentally? I mean, that would be one way to get a sense of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019d feel a little I\u2019d feel more anxious on (ph) maybe what she said or feel this little, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: But not irritated, but anxious. Kind of worried. Bothered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Maybe actually more irritated, actually. Not, like, really worried. Just kind of like, \u201cOh, gosh. I wish she would have phrased that different to my parents.\u201d You know, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: They might think negatively or they might think I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: But again, does that sound like an irritation or more like a \u201cthat\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s inappropriate. That was not very mature. That was condescending. Or that was -\u201d I mean, is it a judgmental kind of thing or -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s more -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: kind of like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s more a judgmental thing, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And the only thing we have to do is go one step beyond that, and that what feeling comes next? And if it then drops you into anxiety, from irritation, then you can go, \u201cOkay, well, let me just treat that as I\u2019m not messing with this. I\u2019m just going to let this one go.\u201d Now, what you said <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">before was, \u201cWell, she\u2019s her own person, you know. (inaudible 08:01) [you can just grab it] (ph).\u201d So that\u2019s a fine intervention about any of those, right? And if that works, by saying it one time, we don\u2019t have to figure anything out. If it does drop into the anxiety piece, then you can probably go, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">\u201cOkay, well, I\u2019m going to be suspicious that this is probably my little cycle that I do, and I\u2019m going to drop it even if I should (ph).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that\u2019s why I had a hard time of understanding if it was, like, an OCD thing or something else. Like, I don\u2019t seem to get stuck in any sort of repetition if she says something or does something. I just (ph) might kind of internally shut down a little bit and feel a little like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s that kind of withdrawing and low, feeling kind of mopey or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m not sure, you know, why, but I\u2019d like to work on that a little bit more because (ph) I\u2019m getting a better handle on I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same sort of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Well, we can try to explore it a little bit. Well, how\u2019d it go when those things happened and you kind of let them you said that she\u2019s did that work when you kind of dismissed it as, you know, she\u2019s her own person? Or did you still feel kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I felt a little bit still this kind of yeah (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: And more a little withdrawn? A little quiet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like, she was like, \u201cWell, why are you so quiet?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Nothing, really. It\u2019s fine.\u201d And I go (inaudible 09:35) you know, there\u2019s sometimes where you\u2019ll say something and I might take that a different way, and I might just kind of shut down a little bit. And I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">you know, something like that. It\u2019s not even a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Okay. Well, do you think the event is something worth processing?

Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Because I feel like a lot of times, they\u2019re such little or petty things, I shouldn\u2019t even begin to have a second thought, you know. [That\u2019s the thing] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: So even if she made a mistake here, I\u2019m just going to move to compassion or forgiveness or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just going to allow it to go on by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Right. It\u2019s weird because, a lot of times, it\u2019s like, for some reason, like, a cue to me is, like, tone of voice is such a big cue. And I don\u2019t I even noticed at work the other day, there\u2019s this guy that\u2019s got hearing aids. And he talks really kind of loud, like, almost like he\u2019s yelling at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">you. But he\u2019s not mad or yelling. But my first instinct was, like, \u201cWow, he\u2019s really getting worked up [in here] (ph).\u201d And then after the meeting, I was like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s just kind of how he talks.\u201d Whereas my wife might say something and she might be really sincere and genuine about it, but her voice <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B2\">might not go up in pitch, so it might not seem as uplifting as I would -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right, so you\u2019re sensitive to that kind of tone and so forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s kind of weird because I feel like sometimes it\u2019ll come and go, as far as my sensitivity on, like, a, you know, verbal tone or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right.

But when you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">get to, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I think I would err on the side of OCD as an obsession, because otherwise, every event. You\u2019re going to call every event into question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah [that would get really annoying] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: So you tried that, where you just went, \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019m just going to let this go.\u201d And you said at least one event, you kind of went back to this kind of low feeling. Or did that last? Did it happen more than once?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I feel like it just it kind of lasted for -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It happened enough for her to notice it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I honestly didn\u2019t really know what completely, like, set it off. I couldn\u2019t think of one thing that, like you know, I was trying to think of one thing where I could have that unsettling thought again and practice like we did. But [it seemed like] (ph) there was a bunch of little things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">that kind of made me feel, you know, anxious, and I just kind of shut down a little bit and just got a little quiet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: And so do you have any perspective on where if that wasn\u2019t OCD, do you have any perspective on where that pattern might have come from in you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Make any sense from your past or any kind of sensitivity around relationships like this? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t have anything really concrete, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: And when you had that kind of low feeling, if you were to put a message on that, what would be the message? I mean, I\u2019m making something up. It\u2019s like, oh, you know, my life\u2019s not going right. Or I feel out of control of this relationship or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: I think it would just basically be like (pause) frustrated or maybe\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Or what would be the sense that would be the reasonable facsimile of frustrated? What is the message? What are you frustrated about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: I guess [I\u2019d be] (ph) frustrated at the way, like, she might have come off in something she said or did, but I don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Perception. How your parents might have perceived her in this example. What was frustrating about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s I\u2019m more worried about what other people would think or say in conversation, if there\u2019s something she said that I didn\u2019t really, you know, agree with or something, which doesn\u2019t make much sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well, again, it makes sense when the issue is, \u201cShe and I are one. How she comes across is a reflection on me. I feel a little embarrassed that she\u2019s presenting herself that way because that makes me look bad.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Maybe that is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Or, \u201cPeople are going to judge my wife negatively.\u201d That\u2019s (pause) on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s part of it. I think that kind of makes sense. We\u2019re [so almost one] (ph) that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s a kind of symbiosis of her and I, and so two of us make one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: How do you think one ought to respond to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Probably go back to (inaudible 15:52) protocol and if something she\u2019s saying or doing isn\u2019t something I\u2019d really say or do, maybe I\u2019d just take that thought in again and just kind of let it go and not worry about judgment or if somebody\u2019s judging her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Okay. Although it sounds like you\u2019re getting hit by it anyway, you know. It\u2019s one thing to you know, to the degree that we\u2019ve been working with the OCD stuff. And I think this is right now we\u2019re talking about something slightly different than the OCD. But, you know, once you start having <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">that low feeling and you\u2019re starting to go (sound effects), \u201cThis is a reflection of me.\u201d Or even if you can\u2019t quite articulate it. It might be interesting, in those moments, to kind of stay with it a little bit and use it. In this example, you weren\u2019t even aware that that was going on for you? Or you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B52\">weren\u2019t aware that you were projecting it out, that somebody could notice it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I wasn\u2019t really aware that it was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: That you had become quieter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just kind of slipped into that a little bit. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Okay. So if you were wife identified it to you, kind of reflected back, like, \u201cI should have been quiet,\u201d you might have been able to go, \u201cOh, I think I know where all this started\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: And then (pause) so, you know, one move to make is self-compassion. Fine, I\u2019m having that reaction. Don\u2019t really understand why I\u2019m having that kind of reaction, but I am, and (pause), you know, it\u2019s a flaw. Minor flaw of mine. And I can forgive myself or accept myself for being that way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">maybe. So we have the reaction, and then we have a reaction to the reaction. So we have a response to the reaction. And so, when you have the reaction that kind of goes (sound effect). So one response is to just take, you know, just sit for a little bit. See if you can reflect on and see where your <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">mind goes, and see if any, you know, flash comes up or memory comes up. Or you could even invite yourself to dream about it. And you might, you know, [you never know] (ph). The unconscious comes up with some data sometimes. You can do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">So you can open up some space to see what might come up. And the second is to do it, the curiosity, from a self-compassionate place, as opposed to a \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me that this is happening?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with her that she\u2019s doing that?\u201d Because it sounds like you and I are thinking that her <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">infraction is minor if an infraction at all. It may not be anything. So we don\u2019t have to spend time trying to analyze why she might have said that. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s been my unproductive time was trying to analyze, \u201cWhy\u2019d she say that?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: What did she mean by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And so that, that\u2019s the OCD piece that we would want to go ahead and go, \u201cI\u2019m not going there.\u201d Because if you go there, then you can\u2019t go where we\u2019re talking about now, which is, \u201cWell, I wonder if I can learn anything about myself.\u201d You do it (inaudible 19:10). It\u2019s like, these things <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">happen enough. I don\u2019t have to understand this particular one. But I\u2019m watching and trying to learn and gather some information as it comes. Make myself available to it. And be okay that it happened. Which, again, is a little different than just letting it go, because you are having feelings. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB2\">don\u2019t think we should dismiss your feelings. Acknowledge your feelings. You don\u2019t have to chase them or anything. Go, \u201cOkay, well there\u2019s that.\u201d And if you could get yourself to start talking again or even let her know. I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: What did you say to her this time? You acknowledged something, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I said, you know, \u201cI\u2019m feeling fairly anxious right now, just from some things (inaudible 20:01) come up in conversation.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m feeling anxious.\u201d I said, you know, \u201cI\u2019ll try to work on not, you know, shutting down or getting all quiet when, you know, something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">maybe doesn\u2019t go my way (inaudible 20:18) or something,\u201d you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: And did she inquire further about that to try to figure out what specific because you\u2019re alluding to something in the conversation. She didn\u2019t go, \u201cWas it something I said?\u201d She didn\u2019t do that? I probably would have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was, honestly, because (inaudible 20:34) so petty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But she did ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: [You\u2019re right] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And were you able to remember what it was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: And how\u2019d she respond to that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: It was basically something like, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. That\u2019s not even (ph) what I meant at all.\u201d Or, you know, something like, \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t being wasn\u2019t trying to come off rude about something,\u201d you know. But it\u2019s usually never the it\u2019s never the fact that I\u2019m thinking though. It\u2019s always about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">the opposite, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Say that again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: So usually, if I\u2019m thinking, you know, she came off, which I would maybe say to her, you know, rude or brash. She would never mean to come off that way. It\u2019s me and the whole, like, tone perception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And do you think it\u2019s a hundred percent you? She has no ownership in things that she says in these examples?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: I think I probably elevate it to a height that it doesn\u2019t need to be, but there is times when she is a very direct person, and she knows it. And there\u2019s some times where she\u2019s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s a little rough for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: And she\u2019s like, \u201cI just stuck my foot in my mouth.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cI know that I sometimes should think a little bit more before I say something.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: So when you bring up this example like we\u2019re talking about, you know, one thing you say to her is, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not actually telling this to you to get you to correct my thinking. I\u2019m more, like, just trying to be open about what triggered it. And I\u2019m working on this and thinking about it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">trying to figure it out.\u201d And then, \u201cThanks for noticing. And I\u2019ll try to come out of it.\u201d So after you have that little exchange with her, then how are you doing? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I mean, does that mood, that feeling, stay shifted all after she calls you on, \u201cHow come you\u2019re quiet\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Not immediately. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re flipping a switch. But at least helps me seem to kind of move past (pause) whatever triggered it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because I think that\u2019s the other piece, is to have when you find yourself sinking in, is to be able to see if you can reach out. And if it\u2019s safe enough to reach out to her and say, \u201cI\u2019m kind of going through that period now.\u201d Then that may be kind of a helping hand to get you into <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">contact again. Because you go quiet, you go up here, in the head. And so she can come out here and kind of state what it is that\u2019s going on without having to feel contrite or remorse or (inaudible 23:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: At least what I do following (ph) is, you know, acquire whatever time it is. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s super long-lasting. Like, you know, if it\u2019s at night, I\u2019ll wake up in the morning and it doesn\u2019t even cross my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Right. But it\u2019s uncomfortable for you and you\u2019re curious about what\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s fine, you know. We can go down a different path. We can look at childhood and all that kind of stuff to figure that out, but let\u2019s not. I mean, we can. Let\u2019s just see what we can do about being in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">moment with [it all] (ph), and it would be totally acceptable to kind of trace some things back and to see if we can get some sense about that. That\u2019s an all right way to do the therapy. But right now, we\u2019re trying to do more grief therapy oriented stuff (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: So similar to the protocol before with this type of thing, I should more kind of relish in the uncertainty of what I was feeling, and then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: No. No. I think the anxiety about \u201cwhat did she mean by that?\u201d we can put that in that category. And I would just kind of recognize it and go, \u201cI\u2019m not going there.\u201d Here, we\u2019re doing an authentic exploring. It\u2019s, like, not embellishing it. Not to try to feel worse about none of that of stuff, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">but just, like, let\u2019s there\u2019s a part of me that I don\u2019t quite understand yet, and I want to open up some space to be curious. Because I think you feel bad and then feel bad about feeling bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: Is that does that make sense to you? You know, it\u2019s like you get that kind of, I keep wanting to say, low-key feeling, but that\u2019s not quite right. It has to do with energy and so forth. But you kind of sink a little bit, and then you seem a little disappointed in yourself or something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">that you have that feeling. And so we\u2019re trying to lift that off so that we can just be okay with it and see what happens. And, you know, as soon as you have some kind of critic come in in there or some kind of judgment about that, then that squelches any kind of learning that comes. So we (ph) can <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201032\">lift that off and go, \u201c(inaudible 25:33) nothing comes up, nothing comes up and it\u2019s okay that I do this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">And then the other thing is if it seems easy to do, even before she calls you on it, to be able to go, \u201cGosh, you know, I had this little event.\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily tell her what it was. I mean, one of the things to explore is to hold the specific in check, because it\u2019s not about the specific. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">It\u2019s about, \u201cI think you said something.\u201d \u201cWell, what specifically did I say?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, I don\u2019t that\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking at. You know, I don\u2019t I can already tell you, you know, what you said is not important. And I don\u2019t need you to, you know, correct me and remind I know. I\u2019m exaggerating <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201052\">these kind of things.\u201d So I go with those two directions, which is trying to lift myself out a little bit to make contact. And also, be curious and see what\u2019s going on and dissect it a little bit. But you have to be careful around that dissecting, all right, because it\u2019s not so much don\u2019t dissect <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201053\">what she said, but dissect what else is coming up for me, if anything.

I just want to reiterate that (inaudible 26:56). So for instance, say, I don\u2019t know, something comes up where she says -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: Well, let\u2019s go to the past. So go ahead and talk about one that did come up. I mean, you don\u2019t have to be specific about it, but here we are at Thanksgiving, talking to the parents. This thing happens. And then what would you do? (Pause) If you were to do it differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: Recognize I feel anxious or whatever, and just kind of think, \u201cAll right, you know, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay that I\u2019m feeling anxious,\u201d but just not really dive into trying to figure out why. Just kind of accepting that feeling and not, you know, feeling frustrated that I\u2019m feeling frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B1\">and going down that, you know, kind of double-negative path. And I know she finds me slipping into a quiet state or if I notice I am, I can say, you know, \u201cI just kind of had some thought. I just want to let you know, and I don\u2019t need to get into, you know, specifics.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you left out the \u201cI\u2019m getting that sinking feeling.\u201d So the anxiety, I\u2019m not going to if the anxiety is about why, analyzing why that just happened, I\u2019m going to let that go and not analyze it. But what do you want to do about the kind of falling into yourself feeling? Based on <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D1\">what we were saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: Do I say just accepting that feeling and just not, I guess, relishing in it? And just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I\u2019m accepting it. Have compassion for myself. I don\u2019t really understand it, and that\u2019s okay not to understand it. But I\u2019m going to have compassion for (pause) this little nuance of mine, emotionally. Anything else that we talked doing in that moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: I feel like there was. I\u2019m trying to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Just keeping my mind open about, do I notice anything about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 29:06) Let me just kind of relax into [feeling this] (ph) kind of feeling. What\u2019s the feeling like? I can notice it. I can say it to myself. So I can kind of report it to myself. And just, you know, (inaudible 29:22) have self-compassion and I\u2019m not running from it. I\u2019m going to, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">you know, (inaudible 29:26) the mindfulness that they talk about. Just to be mindful is to be able to step back and feel compassion and notice it. So you kind of take that mindfulness into the fire. Right now, the fire is not feeling really good. And just see if any information comes up.

(Laughter) You know, I mean, if we\u2019re, you know, right (ph). So we\u2019re really so there\u2019s three pieces of anxiety around the analysis and, you know, why is she doing that. Having the feeling and being (pause) okay having the feeling. And then, being open to seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D1\">what comes next. And the third is to, if it\u2019s possible for you, to reach out to her and just acknowledge, \u201cJeez, I think had this transaction here and I can tell I started to sink back a little bit. And I\u2019m coming back.\u201d So to speak to her is to pull out for a bit. It doesn\u2019t\u2019 mean you\u2019re going to stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D2\">out, but at least you don\u2019t have to be alone with that particular piece. Nothing that you need from her, other than to acknowledge what you just told her. And then that\u2019s fine. If she wants to check in later, ask you how you\u2019re doing, you can do that. So those are (pause) three moves around that piece. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D3\">(inaudible 31:03) Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Just for my notes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">The only thing I\u2019m I was trying to do a little searching on why would I why would some of the things come on, you know, (inaudible 31:40) the past?

I mean, she was up and down <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201231\">and all around, and I think she had, like, severe bipolar or something. There would be times when she\u2019d just kind of, like, get tripped off and just kind of, like, go off on me or something. And, you know, like, I\u2019m usually a pretty easygoing, relaxed guy, till I get caught off guard.

I know sometimes there\u2019s, like, a (pause) so if someone\u2019s critiquing my work, at work, you know, I might get this really rush of anxiety at first. Like, oh god, I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re telling me I need to do this different or that different. Like, I kind of get this rush of, like, \u201cShit, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B1\">no (ph). Like, they\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m right.\u201d And, like, (laughter), you know, then I kind of get this, you know, thought of anxiety where, \u201cOh, no. I have to go back and change that, go ahead and do this different. And oh man, I\u2019m already behind anyway.\u201d And, like so, like, I guess it\u2019s kind of a similar\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">THERAPIST: And what\u2019s the \u201cthey\u2019re wrong, I\u2019m right\u201d part?

Or I have the correct outcome, but they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, I think you need to do a little bit of this different and maybe just change this (inaudible 34:33) faster.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201531\">And I\u2019m, like, thinking to myself (inaudible 34:38) it works. I kind of get like, \u201cDarn it. Why do you want me to change it?\u201d But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">THERAPIST: But now that I\u2019m going to have to change it, because you\u2019re the authority, then it\u2019s going to put me behind and now I can\u2019t get it all done, and then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: And do you think that\u2019s outside of normal limits, in terms of your response? Or does that seem like a pretty normal response for somebody to have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: I mean, I don\u2019t, like, write back any angry e-mails or say anything bad. I kind of just take that in. and then after five or ten minutes, I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right. It\u2019s really not a big deal. Like, they\u2019re just trying to be constructive criticism here, when (ph) they\u2019re trying to help me do something <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B1\">a little bit better.\u201d So I kind of it goes up to here, and then it goes down, because I realize, like, it\u2019s really not a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: That sounds great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: You can get out of that in five minutes. That sounds as good as it gets. I mean, I\u2019d be happy with that, if I were you, in terms of, you know, somebody comes and says what I know to be sufficient is insufficient, and then, because of their authority, I have to make all these changes. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201611\">annoying and frustrating and anxiety-provoking if I\u2019m already stacked up with work and all that. If you can get out of that in five minutes, that\u2019s a pretty resilient kind of response. So I wouldn\u2019t be messing with that one. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah. That (inaudible 36:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: I\u2019d be happy with that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah, that was a similar thing, where if somebody would say something, I would kind of first be like, \u201cOh.\u201d And then like, \u201cOkay.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a little of what you do with your wife. You said, \u201cOh, wait a minute. She\u2019s her own person, and it\u2019s okay for her to be that way.\u201d And again, if you can resonate to that message, you know, take it in and allow that to be a kind of executive message to yourself and cool out, then that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201691\">great too. So again, if, you know, you were writing down those three things that we\u2019re doing. But that one can circumvent everything if you go, \u201cOkay, well there\u2019s that pattern. I don\u2019t need that (ph). You know, no big deal.\u201d And if you can say that, and that works, and it helps you, you can go right <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201692\">to there. Not do anything else, because that\u2019s like what you just said about work. And you can treat it like a habit for a bit (ph) that you want to change. And, you know, if it doesn\u2019t, we want to mess with as few knobs as possible here, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B\">So we have to after some kind of little behavioral maneuvers to get out of it. And if those don\u2019t work, then we back up and make it a little more complex and back up again. But if you can treat it like that, I think that\u2019s a fine first response. The only thing I don\u2019t want you to do about that like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B1\">I\u2019m your boss or something, right? is to be suppressing a bunch of stuff in order to do that. You know, if you can if your whole self kind of lines up with, \u201cHey, you know, there I go, having me think she\u2019s a reflection of me, and I don\u2019t need to go there.\u201d And if your body might kind of line up <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B2\">to that, with that, then that\u2019s as good as done.

Not my perception. I feel like I haven\u2019t been ultra-sensitive to different things she would say or do until, like, the last six months or so. And I don\u2019t know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Does that coincide with anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20171\">CLIENT: Not really at all, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20173\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t coincide with the OCD in general, getting or some of the obsessions getting stronger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20175\">CLIENT: Maybe. I mean, I haven\u2019t really tracked anything, but yeah. So for me, more, you know, it kind of goes back to the (inaudible 38:48). Like, oh gosh, why do I do this? Why do I have these thoughts? Where this is kind of, like, well, jeez. I shouldn\u2019t even be, like, bothered if she says, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201751\">\u201cI really didn\u2019t care for the burger you made,\u201d or something.

So you want to go, \u201cOkay, well that\u2019s interesting I just had that response. I don\u2019t need to get all worked up like this, but there\u2019s that pattern again. Okay.\u201d (inaudible 39:29) you can kind of, you know. Don\u2019t have to get attached to it, but you also don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B1\">to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me that I\u2019m -\u201d you know, you don\u2019t want to degrade yourself about it because, again, that squelches any kind of creative intelligence about the problem.

And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B3\">at work when they make that change.

And then there\u2019s no problem solving going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">So either mother takes care of her and gets her out of there, you know, whatever. Or her mother gets mad. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m just going to -\u201d you know. Because she\u2019s either the rescuer or the persecutor of her little six-year-old, however old the girl is. But there\u2019s no problem solving going <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201811\">on around the anxiety of getting out. And so, I say that to you around the squelching of the \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even have that reaction.\u201d We\u2019re not going to get anywhere when that comes in, so you have to quiet that in order to see what else is around. Is there anything else you think you need to be focused <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201812\">on the next bit (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">CLIENT: I think just those two things, or the two I was previously working on. I feel like I was doing pretty well, and then kind of the new\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20185\">THERAPIST: Are you going to have any stimulus in the next couple of weeks around this? Be hanging out with friends or in situations? Do they happen less with friends [or with] (ph) your wife, than it does around some people like your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20187\">CLIENT: It seems like it\u2019s (pause) less when it\u2019s just one-on-one with me and her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we\u2019re talking about (inaudible 42:34). It\u2019s interaction with other people around, so if it\u2019s a group and there\u2019s conversations, interactions and things, that\u2019s where it would occur.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah, more come up, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018D\">THERAPIST: And do you think there\u2019s going to be any of those opportunities in the coming -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2018F\">CLIENT: [There should be] (ph) with holiday stuff. Now we have a few different things planned with events (ph) and whatever. So [and our next time] (ph) was the 19th. So about, what, two-and-a-half weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20191\">THERAPIST: Does that sound all right to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20193\">CLIENT: That should be fine, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20195\">THERAPIST: So we\u2019re doing good around the OCD stuff, and we\u2019re going to just see how that goes the next time. And then we\u2019re working on this other piece, which is a (crosstalk 43:16). We\u2019ll see how that goes and see if we get a protocol in place. See if you learn anything new. Take notes around seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201951\">(ph) does it come up, even if that\u2019s why you pay me the big bucks, is to help understand. You may have just a response or reaction or something. You\u2019re going, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did that.\u201d But just bring it in, and maybe two heads will be better than one around those kinds of things. And under the <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201952\">overall umbrella of this \u201cfine (ph) that this is happening to me,\u201d right. It\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I want to look at it, because here I am in therapy and I have an opportunity. And even if this continues for me, I can cope with this. The only thing I\u2019m going to, you know, really focus on is not being <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201953\">hard on myself about it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20194-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20194-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560165\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20197\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s helped me the most. I feel like I\u2019ve made progresses accepting that something I\u2019ve recognized for the last, you know, 27 years, I never really dealt with until now and accepting that I\u2019m working on improving myself. It\u2019s helped me, where in the past, it was just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201971\">like, this negative, like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Darn it\u201d thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20199\">THERAPIST: It\u2019d be great if you were able to keep catching that. I mean, you think a little bit about our relationship. If you don\u2019t sense some kind of compassion from me toward you and I\u2019m just a, you know, I have poor bedside manner but I got ideas and so forth, you can imagine how much more difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201991\">it would be to be interacting with me. And so it\u2019s that, you know, the whole idea of being compassionate with myself, allowing myself to have these responses. I\u2019m going to look at them, but I\u2019m going to look at them from a non-critical way, because the other way hasn\u2019t seemed to work very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think it helps too that (inaudible 45:19) my wife is real supportive and she knows that I\u2019m working on things, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s really causing you know, we don\u2019t ever yell at each other, get in fights. Like, we just don\u2019t do that. We\u2019re both pretty compassionate. But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2019B1\">tell her sometimes, you know, \u201cI\u2019m really struggling internally with some things I\u2019m working on. I just want to let you know.\u201d And she always says, you know, \u201cI fully support you. Let me know of anything I can help with.\u201d So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s great.
