I guess it does feel like I\u2019m, I don\u2019t know, feeling things are kind of taking action or trying to make plans and stuff. [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">at 00:02:19] busy and anyways I\u2019ll be more consumed by that and not dealing with things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I imagine you might feel a little whirl (ph) where or something like that when you\u2019re here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Right. I guess I feel like, I don\u2019t know, I guess like I\u2019m supposed to talk about things that are bothering me and I guess I don\u2019t, for most part of the day I don\u2019t allow things kind of to bother me or kind of [I just] (ph) deal with things. But, I guess all the worries and anxieties about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t really thought about them or processed them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re maybe feeling a little bit in relation to me like you haven\u2019t done your homework? That\u2019s not exactly right but it makes you feel a little bit like that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I just feel like I don\u2019t know what I want or just kind of process things instead of being whatever, distracted by everyday things. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know I guess I just feel like I\u2019m not sure of what I should do or I don\u2019t have any control anyway, just going to be pressured at work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">and just be and do those things. I don\u2019t really have time or energy to process other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s just also really frightening to process things. I mean to sort of open yourself up to what your emotional experience is and see your confusion, uncertainty. That can [inaudible at 00:10:24] vulnerable and overwhelming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. I mean just going into things just makes me feel worse and in terms of there is no solution and I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m usually angry and I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019re not more eager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Yes I mean in the end it just goes like there\u2019s nothing that can be done or nothing I can do or I don\u2019t know what I want or out of it so what\u2019s the point. For example, my parents; in the end I don\u2019t want anything from them. I feel like I just have to be something they want but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I don\u2019t want to deal with that. I don\u2019t want to I can\u2019t sit there and try to listen to them and try to figure out their problems or be some relief or help for them. I don\u2019t want to do that, so what\u2019s the point? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I guess in a similar way I imagine it all must also be kind of difficult to let your friends sort of I think as you could anyway making this kind of implicit demand that you focus on all these things and change how you decide what you are or something like that in a way that feels like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">not really going to get you anywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right, I mean me voicing my anger or what I dislike or, it doesn\u2019t change anything and I can\u2019t come up with a solution or something that\u2019s real or lasting. Yes, in the end it\u2019s kind of a problem. Yes, I mean there\u2019s a worthless circle push in there. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Well except that it does, I think actually I [inaudible at 00:16:34] another way to put that. Sometimes it does I think tend at times to really bring the bad. I mean for example if somebody dies and you mourn them it doesn\u2019t make them any less dead. And sometimes it feels pretty shitty <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">to do but it also helps. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562210\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: I just feel like it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s there\u2019s no kind of getting away from whatever, I don\u2019t know. Just kind of the hate or the anger and yes, just constantly there and coming up in different ways and there\u2019s no relief or time doesn\u2019t help them; it makes it worse. Other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">make it worse and make me feel worse. It comes up only when I\u2019m trying to be distracted at work or whatever it comes up. There\u2019s no getting away from it or there\u2019s no, I don\u2019t know, processing or dealing with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: So, I\u2019m sorry I think I had something kind of backwards before. Saying that it might seem too like your parent\u2019s house. I actually don\u2019t think I quite described it right. I think what you\u2019re describing is you feeling in some ways a bit like your mom\u2019s been trying to deal with stuff with your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">brother and saying that she just can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t know what to do or how to change what she needs to do and yet she\u2019s worried about it all the time. That it\u2019s clearly very present for her all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">Now there\u2019s an unclear difference in that you\u2019re trying very hard to find somebody to deal with this and make it better although it\u2019s unclear how to do that. And you\u2019re feeling I think kind of hopeless about it. But it sounds more like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I mean it feels like there\u2019s no way of dealing with it. Yes, and I feel like there\u2019s so many things that are like that, not just my brother; it\u2019s everything. And, so <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Or there\u2019s no, there was not time or place to kind of process things. That never happens [pause] because I come here or also I\u2019m consumed by work and then if I go home I\u2019m just consumed with hate and so there\u2019s no <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Can you say that again, if you\u2019re here you\u2019re here you\u2019re consumed with work and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: With work and what I should be doing and what I\u2019m I\u2019m making a play of things and then when I go home it\u2019s consumed with hate and there\u2019s no place or time to kind of process or think or sort of just deal. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Sorry but I\u2019m not clear on how really consumed you are by those other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess [pause] yes, I don\u2019t want to think about it.
