It involves putting a bunch of stickers and paper and glitter on a page and then using that as a backdrop for putting pictures or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Pictures (ph), ticket stubs, or whatever else, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, the whole thing seems pretty hideous to me.

I did wind up with one of yours today (inaudible at 0:08:59). [0:09:01] (Pause) (inaudible at 0:09:27) there's something that's in a way very you and I think also maybe pretty Italian (ph) in, we've had a fairly elaborate lunch and brownies and pictures and artwork. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah, I'm pretty aware of that. [0:09:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: I'm aware of it before I got here. The lunch is how I grew up. My mom cooked day and worked. When I come home to make dinner, I think of how routine that was for her, and it still is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: How amazing that is. This isn't our homemade yogurt. It would be more us and less my mom if it were homemade yogurt. She doesn't (ph) make homemade yogurt (inaudible at 0:10:42). The lunch is not extravagant from the point of view of where I'm coming from. [0:10:57] But everything else and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">lunch is pretty me. If you're not going to go out with me to eat or go to a museum, I'm going to make this as much like those things as I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:11:32)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I sort of do it everywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause) [0:12:00] You sound a bit self-conscious about it or about my pointing at it. And (pause) it makes me imagine... it makes me think that, in a way (pause), I think you kind of want it all to just seem like it happened and kind of had its effects...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Without there being attention paid to kind of what you did or how you arranged it. [0:13:03] And... as though... yeah, I don't know, you're a little worried about what I'd make of your motives or something. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: I think I just want to show you a lot and share a lot with you. I thought a lot about what to do on my bike ride home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause) [0:14:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: I thought a lot about what to do even before I left. Okay, it's 3:20. I'm more hungry than I thought I would be. I had a bunch of snacks in the morning. (Pause) It's raining. (Pause) What's it going to be like to go straight to Jay and be wet and hungry (pause) and be on time? What's it going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F1\">to be like to pick something up that isn't quite going to hit the spot or... and is going to make me late and going to cost money and not hit the spot? [0:14:58] And I have to decide where to go. I couldn't think of anything that was more satisfying than that. Okay, how late will I be if I go home? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F2\">What should I do when I get home? Should I change? What should I change? [A whole lot of] (ph) different things. Should I warm up my food? And then all the while, what's Jay going to think? What's he going to think? What are his impressions going to be? Is he going to ask me about my lunch? (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F3\">Maybe I shouldn't bring my bike in because then he's going to know that I biked here. He's going to say be careful. That would be great if he said be careful. Yeah, there's a whole lot of premeditated thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:15:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: And I think none of it would have started if I didn't have stuff to do while I was here, eat lunch and be wet. If I had eaten lunch and I weren't wet, I wouldn't think much at all about (pause) what will happen (inaudible at 0:16:20). And I wanted to show you the artwork anyway. Yesterday I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200931\">wanted to show it to you. And I wanted to give you brownies on Tuesday when I made them. So those things would have happened. I wouldn't have thought too much about it. So it's a whole... I think it's a whole lot of, not performance, but (pause) stuff that I really genuinely want that has to somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200932\">fit in the room and in the time and still make a lot out of my time. [0:17:16] (Pause) I'm glad it's over (chuckling). It feels over.

It does not seem performative. It... [0:18:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just want all these things... I want to share all these things with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It's more like you're... that's what it sounds like to me. You want to share all these things with me, and you're worried in some ways thinking about how much you want to as well as about how I'm going to react, how much it's going to mean to me, and how excited I'm going to get about it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">or into it, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.

No. (Pause) I think maybe you're worried, too, that I'm seeing it as performative rather than kind of expressive. [0:19:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. It doesn't seem like you do see it as performative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: We're not supposed to use that word anymore because it's wrong?

I use the word performative a lot. That's (ph) something that's coming up that I notice a lot? And we looked it up, and performative seemed like something completely different. (Pause) [0:21:00] Performative. Being or relating to an expression that serves to effect a transaction <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">or that constitutes the performance of a specified act by virtue of its utterance. A performative verb such as promise, whereas performatory, of or relating to performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: So... but why does it say performative also? (Pause) I don't know. I don't know which one to use. [0:21:58] (Pause) What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I don't know.

I have had for a long time. [0:58:00] (Pause) It feels like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB1\">(inaudible at 0:58:12) is forming or needs to form or might be the... (Pause) I don't know. I don't know what expectations I have. But it was my relationship with myself, the ability to sooth and connect with myself as a response or as a response to feeling lonely and disoriented. [0:58:55] Or, if when <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB2\">that happens or when it appears, it seems to make those feelings go away or buffer them a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

I expect you're coming from such a different place that... or such a different context and a different perspective, that the magnitude of this for me (pause) can't resonate with you in a certain way, because you have the benefit of some other stuff. [1:06:08] Your having <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF1\">gone through it yourself or experience with other patients or openness to uncertainty, maybe with no idea what's going to happen, and none (ph) of those things color your receiving how much of a loop this is throwing me for. But maybe your tolerance of, how long does this take, how (pause)... not how <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF2\">long it's going to take, because that suggests that we're waiting. [1:07:01] And it doesn't feel like we're waiting, but how slow the steps... how slow the journey...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">THERAPIST: How long you're going to have to stand this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">CLIENT: No...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT: How circuitous it feels. Maybe you just have a lot more tolerance for it. So I feel like you really do understand, but you understand in the way that you can (pause), which might be... maybe you completely understand, and it's the same understanding that I have. I don't know. But the differences <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201C71\">between you and me seem really important in this question.

(Pause) Everything about coming in another day in the week feels good until I think about all of those mind traps. What does it mean? How does it sound? It sounds like kind of a lot. It sounds... it's going to sound like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D71\">kind of a lot to other people. [1:11:58] It makes me feel even more entangled and susceptible to even more pain if one of us disappears. It creates a really nice... or maybe it would create a really nice... even more a sense of stability that maybe I should be developing as a result of something else. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D72\">Or maybe instability is good. Maybe that Monday cycle of being just about ready to tear my hair out... but it wasn't as bad this week (pause), maybe that's... (chuckling) what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">THERAPIST: It's a little like your mother's voice to me.

But one, she said, well (pause), you don't really want to go in another day in the week, because there can't be that much to talk about. (Pause) [1:13:56] I said, you don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF1\">know that, do you? (Pause) And I think she knows that there is... there are endless important things to talk about and that it's a really good fit for me. But I don't know what... what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">THERAPIST: No, I didn't have a definite thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">CLIENT: Then have the opposite reaction, which is, of course you want to go in more days. You would love to sit with Jay every day of the week and talk. That is something that you would love to do. That is obvious to me. The other thing my mom said was, you really want to be... I don't know what's the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E31\">word she used. [1:14:58] But it's like, because then... careful or something, because then Jay really becomes a part of the fabric of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Hmm.
