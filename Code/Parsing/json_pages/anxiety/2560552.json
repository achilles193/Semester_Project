Um. So I was at an Assyrian picnic thing yesterday that they do over the summer. And I noticed that, like the past week, I saw Dave on Tuesday and it happened a little bit there too. But on the one hand I have gotten so much better about not caring about finding someone to be in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">relationship with or whatever. But on the other hand it is part of the not caring has been just being sad about it and not dwelling on finding someone but just accepting the fact that it makes me sad (laughs) or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">But anyway, so at the thing last night it was like, you know, I mean because I partly do want it. It would be cool if I met a cool Assyrian chick or whatever. You know, I had one eye open. I was kind of like, you know. There usually is no one. But there was one chick, whatever, and I didn't take it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">so seriously or whatever. And I very slyly found out who it was and whatever, blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">But even that, I was like I don't know why. I think things like that are kind of depressing me more than Not in the way they used to where I get really dark and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: It is just in a sad way. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Where I feel like I am at a weird age where, she is probably like 24 or something. Do you know what I mean? That is just too. I am just at a weird place now. Do you know what I mean? It is hard to It is just not easy. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Hard to? [That sounded like something you didn't finish.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I mean a lot of them are just young. And that is too young now. You know? I mean even late 20's is too young. I mean it depends on the person. But generally, you know. Yeah, it is just much more difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So that makes you sad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it feels like, it is like I said, it is like I am not, it doesn't make me go to a dark place the way it used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: But, yeah, it is like, pfff, this is the reality now. You know? It just is what it is. It is not the end of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: But it is, you know. (pause) Yeah, because when I was with Dave I felt, yeah, I felt a little (pause) He started talking to these two chicks. I mean I was also kind of annoyed just because he brings his dog everywhere now. And I love his dog but it is almost like that is his security blanket <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">in a way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I mean it is also obviously very smart. I mean the clich s is true about if you bring dog somewhere and everybody wants to talk to you including attractive women. But I was like, \"God, here we go.\" You know, it is like so when I hang out with him now I feel like Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Like he pays so much attention to the fucking dog (laughs) and I am like, \"Are we going to have a real conversation or?\" I mean I love Sparky but, you know. Anyway. But even there I was kind of like, I don't know. I am just not I don't know what is going on. I almost don't feel the I want to make effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">So when he was talking to these two girls I kind of wanted to but I didn't. Do you know what I mean? I was like, \"I don't know.\" I am just not (pause) I don't know. And we were talking about it. He seems to be totally okay with not caring. I remember I think I was telling you. I don't know if that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">is really true or not. But, yeah, I don't think I am that okay yet. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560552\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I mean I am okay, but I am not I think maybe because I have this added cultural, it is more, it feels more torturous to me in a way. I mean because he is not even dating, he's not doing, you know. I mean I am doing fine in terms of just if I want to. But I don't know if just need to somehow confront <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">more of this Assyrian thing and just maybe that would free my mind or my ability to just take a leap and commit more with someone who is not Assyrian. I don't know. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Because then the other sad thing that happens is with Assyrian chicks I am always shooting low because I have to. Right? There is just not a pool of people to choose from. So the ones who are attractive or whatever they still, you know, if they were not Assyrian they wouldn't be my top, you know, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">So that is also kind of sad. It is like, \"Wait, so what am I doing?\" So I don't know. I don't know. I mean I know guys do that. They are like, \"I am going to marry an Assyrian girl.\" And that is what they do. They pick one that they are attracted to enough and who they like enough, whatever the hell <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">they decide. And then they just go for it. You know? I don't know if I can do that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">Not to mention that I am not even usually their type anyway. You know, I'm not. There is that too. You know? I am just not. For whatever reason, whatever luck or skills or charm I have with non-Assyrian (laughs) women I don't have with Or I have initially maybe but they don't really want to, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">It never goes anywhere. I don't know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You have feelings about being excluded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Feelings about being excluded come up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. That is what I am saying. It has always been like an outsider. When I am with non-Assyrians everything is great except this one kind of important I don't show it. Do you know what I mean? So in a way they know, but they don't know. You know, like my friends are, if I am Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">yesterday, Jeremy's, my Assyrian friend's girlfriend is not Assyrian. And when I saw people and I was talking she was just kind of like, \"Whoa! Like you really speak Assyrian.\" You know? It is like, \"Yeah, I do.\" It is just like I am not like a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">Like Jeremy doesn't really His Assyrian is more like cute. He knows some phrases and words and he tries to say some things and you know. Do you know what I mean? So there is that too. Like when I am hanging out, when I do have a girlfriend or something, they love it. They love that I am this or that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">but I don't think they get how deep that is. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">It is not just like, \"Oh yeah. I am proud of my heritage.\" You know. Do you know what I mean? So then that makes me feel kind of, it is a pretty big chasm that I don't think they get. You know? And then with Assyrian chicks they don't really get this other huge I mean my life is mostly lived as a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">very American guy. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And they don't get that as much because they are so fucking enmeshed in Assyrian things. You know, they are raised a certain way. They are not They think they are kind of worldly but they are not. You know? And really they are, at the end of the day, way more conventional.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560552\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: You are sort of saying that the culture they value (cross talking at 00:08:14).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. They might be a little artsy, they might be this or that. But, yeah, at the end of the day they want stability, they want, yeah. They are not, yeah. I mean not that I am so unstable but I think, I mean obviously I have a vibe of not being Mr. Business Guy or something. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: So even though, I mean I, you know. (pause) Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: What just stopped you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What just stopped you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I just saw the Jacques Lacan book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: And I always wanted to know more about that guy but it is difficult. No, I was thinking about it. Yeah, I mean the more I have thought about it, I mean I am actually pretty stable. (laughs) I mean I have got a fucking home, I have got Do you know what I mean? Like it is not, but I am not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">guy. Do you know what I mean? I am not going to throw on the khaki pants and the polo shirt. Do you know what I mean? Not that they all want that but they want that more than, you know. So. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">Not to mention, I mean it is funny because it was actually really cute the way it worked out. First, it was actually kind of fun. This time I didn't, because I wasn't dwelling and I kind of didn't care. I mean I guess I really didn't care. But I invited my Mom over because I had made my Mom go to this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">I was like, \"Mom, all your friends are going to be there. They all want you to go all the time.\" They do it every Thursday for July and August. It is really nice. You know? It is home cooking basically. And I don't go to a lot So it is kind of nice to see people I don't normally see and whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">You know, it is community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">So I was like, \"You are going. I am going to go with Jeremy. So I want you to go.\" So she was there with a big group of friends or whatever. It is the Assyrian health corps. So it is a big, you know, all these ladies. They are lovely people. You know? So I was like, \"You know what? I am going to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">what I have never done before but now I am going to start doing.\" I just called my Mom over. (laughs) I said, \"Mom, who is that girl?\" You know, they love that shit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: So she immediately got, you know, they couldn't quite figure it out. So then I asked my good friend who I went fishing with, his nephew, he is like 20 or something, and because he went over to that table and was talking to them. So I invited him. So I was like, \"Get over here.\" You know, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">we were talking and he is a really good kid anyway so I kind of like You know,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">I feel like I am the way my Dad was to maybe these friends of mine that tell me about my Dad. Do you know what I am saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: So I was like, you know. So I was like, \"Are you dating that girl,\" whatever. So he was like, \"No, no, no. It is like a family friend. She is older.\" And I was like, \"How old is she?\" Whatever. So it was kind of fun. It was kind of cute. Like I don't do shit like that. Who does that? But it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">is such a community kind of thing. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">It is like you are at a big family function or something, you know. And you can't go to a picnic and you can't just walk up to someone's table and And there was no one I knew at the table, otherwise I would have. But I didn't know anybody there. So anyway. But, yeah, I was like, \"Oh yeah, dude, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">will talk to her if you want,\" whatever. He was like, \"She is kind of stuck up.\" But, you know, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560552\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">So in that way it is good. I mean I am not For me it is the bigger question. It is not so much about that girl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, but in the past it would be that moment would be catastrophized. Do you know what I mean? It is not about that anymore. It is just a bigger question of what these things represent. Because now what am I supposed And he was so nice. Like as I came in, \"Here is your Facebook thing.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: You know, it was like, \"I will put in a word for you if you want or whatever.\" I mean, what am I going to do, send this girl a random note on Facebook? I mean I guess I could but I don't know. (pause) All these things are just kind of, it is silly in a way when you are part of a community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">Oh the other thing is of course we have a couple of mutual Facebook friends. It is a small community, people talk. I mean chicks, they talk whether they are Assyrian or not. But especially in that, you know, everyone is kind of. So there is that as well. \"Do you know this Arto (sp) guy?\" or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">You know? They do that shit. You know? So I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">It is almost embarrassing in a way because my track record is so bad. Do you know what I mean? Like it is the exact opposite. You know? So some of them are going to be like, \"Oh yeah. He asked me out.\" You know? And who knows what they say. Like I don't know why they didn't go out with me. So who knows <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">what? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">\"He's an artist who doesn't have money.\" I don't know what the problem is but Because I noticed that two of our mutual friends are girls I had asked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: And of course it figures all the pretty ones are, the few pretty ones that I would even bother asking out, are all friends with each other. You know? So it is like, I don't know. It is just very high school. It's very high school. It is pretty lame. Because what ends up happening is, it is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">a big deal, but I do feel kind of like, \"Who are you to not go out with.\" (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">They are just weird. Do you know what I mean? That is one thing that kind of rubs me the wrong way. It is like I have dated a lot of really nice, wonderful, pretty I mean, you are some girl who lives at home with a real estate license and like what is it? I don't know. I don't know if they are I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">don't know what it is but it does rub me the wrong way a little. (pause) (sigh) I don't know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">I think it is just, you know, I am just realizing this could be it. Not \"it\" like it is over. But I am just realizing, yeah, this is what it is now and I could maybe not be married. Or forget married, I could not maybe have a really serious I don't know. Because I can't seem to go that extra step <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">with non-Assyrian, right? You know? I haven't been able to. Why? I am sure there are other reasons (laughs), not just that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: But I am realizing that that is kind of a big deal.

I was thinking about Jeremy yesterday. Right? Here he is with his non-Assyrian girlfriend and Oh, that is what it was. He is telling me about how they went to Ohio to her family. I have never been able to envision myself doing stuff like that. Isn't that weird?

Remember there was that girl Megan I was dating for a while with autistic? Right? I met her family once, (inaudible at 00:15:53) in Newberry Port or something. There was just something. It doesn't seem right. Do you know what I mean? And that is not good. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">mean I am from here.

There <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">was something, I can't explain it. I met her brother. Cool guy. Very nice guy.

I think it is just I would like to think. Maybe I am realizing that maybe I am just smart enough that that part of me is very awake. And it is like, \"This is great.

I don't know if that is just in my mind. I don't know if it is part of me that is looking out being more like, \"No, I'm not.\" Like it is kind of old school in a way.

Look at the past. I was in love. Even Meredith, right? In my mind it was, \"What is going on here?\" Her Mom is a former beauty queen. They were homeless for a while. She is with some weird guy now. I was like, \"What is that world?\" That is not for me. I can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">figure that It is not that I want to be enmeshed in some fucking crazy Assyrian family.

Do you know what I mean? It is like going to this fucking picnic. I don't want to be doing that all the time. I don't want to volunteer. I don't want to be enmeshed in the whole thing. But when I am there I like that dose. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">it feels really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">You know, I like seeing these people talk in Assyrian. You know, it just feels like home to me. You know? Seeing the kids. You know I feel like, well, that is so cool. Like look at this couple. Look how cute their kids are. They speak Assyrian. They speak English. You know? There is something sweet <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">about that. I like that. You know, something very rooted or very grounded. You know? I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">Whereas all my You know, all these people they don't know who they are.

I relate to it on a \"let's date.\" (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">And we have a million things in common but the one thing we don't have in common is kind of a big deal. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">So, yeah, I think the sadness now is I am just realizing, \"Well, but it is also not perfect if \" Do you know what I mean? When I have met Assyrian chicks I either have to kind of settle on their appearance or things we have in common or whatever. Or then we have different. Yeah, we do relate on all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">these things but then we don't relate on I don't know. It is a bummer. It really is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">I almost wish I had been raised more conventional.

Or that I would be more like Jeremy and some of my Assyrian American friends where that guy doesn't think twice. They don't, you know. Whatever works. I mean whoever they love they love and that is that. You know? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">their parents don't care.

Do you know what I mean. I am just not because I am so used to these black <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">and white kind of worlds that bubbles. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: And I just have trouble. I can't seem to I get very self-aware and I get very like, \"What?\" Everything seems like a It is jarring almost. You know? I am like, \"What is this furniture? What is this\" (laughs) You know? Like their habits, the way they are. Everything is just alien, you know, to me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">When I went with Michelle (sp) to Newfoundland, right? To her family. I was like, I did it. You know, it was fine.

One day my family might not, my Mom is not going to be around. You know? So it could be that her family, like maybe it is a desire I have to be like, \"You know, I want to continue what I feel with my family.\" I want to feel that with, you know. I don't have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">to see them all the time but I want to feel like, oh, I can go and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Like it is home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Her Mom makes similar food or we can talk in Assyrian and have a, you know, I can feel that sense of continuity or something.

I just thought of that now actually. Maybe that is part of what it is that I just feel like one day that could be Like if I do have a kid, right? I'm older, my Mom's older. God forbid if she wasn't around. So then what does that mean? The kid then really is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">to be raised my friend Jeremy. He will be kind of proud that he is half Assyrian or whatever. He might be very proud, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">But that is not the same thing. You know? It is just not. There is no way for that kid, unless it is so enforced to speak Assyrian. You know? Assyrian parents have trouble getting their kids to speak Assyrian. Do you know what I mean? So I don't know if I want that. You know? I don't know. It is tough. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">It is a really tough thing.

But also to what degree are you looking for that like sort of your Mom again, the Mom you didn't have? You know? And does that Evansville family <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">just feel so foreign to what it is that you are missing inside that it just doesn't fit the mold?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560552\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">CLIENT: Hm. It is possible. Although usually with non-Assyrians their moms are usually way cooler. You know? They are super nice, they are super, you know. So I don't know. Oddly enough, you know, I just realized this. With Julia's (sp) Mom and Dad I felt more comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">THERAPIST: You told me about her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think there is maybe something because they are so grounded. They are Germans. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, that is different than Assyrians but there is something about, like they are German. They have a sense of an identity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">THERAPIST: European even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah.

They understand something about history and tradition. I don't know. I don't know what it is but I felt comfortable with them. We went to her sister's house near Cologne. I felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D1\">comfortable. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">It was different but it was different in a really good way. I was like, \"Wow, this is cool.\" You know? Like they are so, they are warm but everything is so cool and European. Like everything is. But, yeah, I didn't feel I could have felt weird there. It's fucking Brubeck (ph). It is way up near the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F1\">Baltic Sea. It was the dead of winter and it was a really bad winter. That is the recipe for anxiety attacks.

I didn't feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: So that is interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't feel that way. There is something about people that have a sense of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Like just even solid cultural identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: That is important to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Like the more, I don't want to say homogeneous, but just, yeah, something that is Whereas here, yeah, I guess I just feel like everyone is floating. It is just like this hodgepodge of, I don't know what it is. And if you are not really from that, some people I think are fine with that. I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">seem to be fine. It doesn't work for me somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: So maybe even just the commonality of where you come from really mattering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: That that is a relation that even if she is German -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: that identify is really important to her family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: That you can relate on that level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Even if it is not Assyrian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: Exactly.

And they asked him, \"Yeah, have you ever dated an Assyrian.\" And he said, \"I can't because I feel like I am dating my cousin.\" You know? And I have always wondered if there is something going on in these kind of traumatized little communities where, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D1\">know, these broads are marrying like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">This one chick who I kind of, you know, tried to pursue who initially had a thing for me, she married another dude.

Like for them Assyrian dudes are just too much like their brothers or their fathers. I don't know what it is. They are not, I don't know. Or it is the ones who they know that they are pretty.
