I also remember... well I didn\u2019t remember, I knew that I had this kind of... when I worked at UConn for that year, whatever it was that I taught, they... it was mandatory that some of your money went into a... some kind of state <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">pension fund, whatever it is. So I remembered that a week or two ago, and I\u2019ve got like $1200 in there. So I\u2019m just going to withdraw it. I mean it\u2019s going to only end up being probably more like $900 or $800 after they cut whatever, but at least that\u2019ll be a little extra something.  Because the ESA <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">thing didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve got to pay $200 for that, for Cecelia. The airline just doesn\u2019t allow any...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] for cats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: No, it can only be dogs, yeah. So I called and did that yesterday. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: That allows her to ride below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, cargo or cabin. You have to pay, yeah. I got the dimensions and all that. So worse comes to worse if they say... I mean I\u2019ve reserved it for her so that\u2019s all set, but they were like the only thing that could happen is you could get to the airport and they, for whatever reason, they can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">be like there\u2019s just no room in the cabin. You might have to put her in cargo. But they\u2019re like probably not. We\u2019ve already put her in for... yeah. So what I had to pick up was Assyria, they\u2019re so funny man, they still they don\u2019t even know their own laws about pets because they\u2019re like who gives a shit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\"> They don\u2019t know. So I called the embassy and the way the woman answered the phone at the embassy was the way... it epitomized so many things about Assyrians are just immigrant... this is our fucking Assyrian embassy in DC. She really went hello. That was... I was like is this the Assyrian embassy? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">She\u2019s like yeah. Jesus fucking Christ. So she had no idea. I was like does this health certificate need to be endorsed by the USDA before\u2026 she\u2019s like I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s like well just... she\u2019s like just endorse it just to be on the safe side. Okay. So that\u2019s why I had to pick up this thing, I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">to send to the USDA telling them stamp it and send it back. So anyway, yeah, it\u2019s been a full day already.  Left the house around 8:00, was just writing; I started a new essay. And I\u2019m just like errands and dealing with my phone; I don\u2019t want to pay a shitload of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I did that. Then I\u2019ve got to call my car insurance and have them stop that. Yeah, it\u2019s crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s becoming more and more real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s cool, I mean... and it\u2019s... I just feel excited.  That\u2019s the... yeah, I feel kind of anxious with... I mean you know the other thing I was thinking about today was a lot of the anxiety I tend to feel, not a lot, but I mean... I also just don\u2019t like flying. I don\u2019t get sick, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">panic or anything, I just... I\u2019m a thinker, so it\u2019s just.... doesn\u2019t make sense to be flying in the air at 700 miles an hour. It\u2019s just so weird to me. So I\u2019m not a big fan but... so a lot of times my anxiety or nervousness is mostly just that. It\u2019s just... I just want to actually get there, and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">the ordeal of getting there is just not my favorite. Although I mean I\u2019m fine once we\u2019re in the air and all that. It\u2019s just weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562552\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so what about flying? It feels\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I mean it just seems like it should be impossible. I mean it\u2019s a huge fucking enormous thing flying through the air at 30,000 feet. That\u2019s pretty insane, while you\u2019re just watching Seinfeld in your chair. I mean that\u2019s pretty fucking weird. Amazing but it\u2019s just hard for me to zone it out all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">the time. But, yeah. The other thing that happened today was my friend... the doctor needed just some address in Assyria, so just do you have an address where you\u2019re going to be or whatever. So this was the first time I got to see my friend\u2019s address where I might crash a little bit, to actually see <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">it.  And their zip code was 0001. I was like that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s small town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Welcome to Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Small country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know, yeah. It\u2019s just one day at a time. I\u2019m also being kind of careful with this girl that I\u2019ve been texting with every day.  That painter girl from San Diego. I want to be a little careful with that because I... she seems really awesome and everything but I don\u2019t want to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">there and... to a place I\u2019ve never been and be entangled. You know what I mean? I just... so I mean I guess I won\u2019t since I\u2019m being thoughtful about it but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Entangled with\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Hopes or... you know what I mean? This or that. She could be the most annoying person I\u2019ve ever fucking met in my life once I get there. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: She lives in San Diego, part time San Diego, part time Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: She does what I plan on doing but she somehow keeps going back and forth. She has an apartment in Assyria, and I think she owns a little club or runs a little club.  I don\u2019t know what that is. And she paints. And then she\u2019s in movies or something. I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s set up a really nice life <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">for herself. I think. I don\u2019t know if she comes from money or whatever. I don\u2019t know what that is but she makes it work somehow. So what I like is she\u2019s not a native because they\u2019re different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: She was born here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I think she was born in Cairo. She was more like these friends of mine who... they came here when they were 13, 14, 15, 20, whatever. She did set design for movies or something for a while. I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s a very interesting person. But I\u2019ve just been very conscious of okay, this is great. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">It could be awesome but I\u2019m just going to have fun with our little exchanges and when I get there we\u2019ll... I mean we\u2019ll see what happens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of cautioning temporary Bless you. [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, well it\u2019s just what we\u2019ve been talking about almost every time. It\u2019s just... I know I\u2019m being a bit hyper-vigilant about it. I just... it just feels good to be that way right now. It\u2019s like I know I\u2019m going to get there and not. Or even if I get there and she is the most annoying person <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">in the world, yeah, I\u2019ll be a little bit disappointed and bummed, but it\u2019s not going to put me in a tailspin. But even that I want to guard against.  It\u2019s like I just want to go with really low to zero expectations and then be pleasantly surprised. Or if not, then it\u2019ll just be like well whatever. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">mean it\u2019s\u2026 but I think... like I mean today I\u2019ve been... I\u2019m working on a new essay, which has to do with... I decided to write an essay about my Mickey Mouse record player that I had in North Carolina that was my best friend, other than my little guitar I played... got after that. So I decided to write <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200413\">a little essay about that and about the first number of 45s and records that I bought. Or that my mom bought or whatever... whoever bought it for me. So I think that\u2019s good. It\u2019s a good sign.  I think it\u2019s very healthy to be able to think back to those memories and to really think them instead of feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200414\">like they\u2019re some kind of weird... I still feel that way about San Francisco, just that, like I said, it just feels so... but now I\u2019m looking back at my childhood and those are more... you know what I mean? Like at the mall. And it was so weird at the mall. It was like... it was an outdoor mall, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200415\">the coolest part of the mall where the record shop was, this weird underground place with a yogurt shop, a photo booth, a record store, and a kind of pretty risqu\u00e9 lingerie shop. That\u2019s what I remember about this. And I fucking loved it. I mean ice cream, records, and pretty girls, and a photo booth. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200416\">It was awesome. But that\u2019s... it\u2019s more concrete now. I\u2019m starting to remember those things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562552\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: I was wondering what was coming up around the first records you bought. What did you write about? Mickey Mouse record...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Just about being a lonely kid and a latchkey kid and how that record player was like my best friend. I remember carrying it around the apartment and just plugging it in wherever. It was like a lunchbox that you open up and his arm\u2019s the needle. That\u2019s kind of where it all started, all the creativity. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">I mean in a way I\u2019m trying to write about how a lot of artists, I think they start reflecting on how did I get... become an artist, and especially in my case, where I don\u2019t even know how I learned to play the guitar. I don\u2019t remember. How do you learn? I don\u2019t... how do you go from banging on the piano <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">to really knowing how to play the piano. It\u2019s weird. So kind of about that and, I don\u2019t know, just kind of other... it\u2019s like a lot of... about a lot of things I think.  But\u2026 at first I was going to make it about my... the red guitar and this and I was like you know what, I think these are all different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200453\">essays because they\u2019re big chunks of... I mean just that record player I could write a lot about. And getting the guitar was a whole other ordeal. All this stuff. So yeah, I think I\u2019m charting my development, like how did I do this stuff, or what it meant to me or whatever. And now it\u2019s so great with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200454\">the Internet you can... I hadn\u2019t seen that record player since I was 12. I just did a search, boom. Exactly the way I remember it. I wish I knew what that red guitar... I don\u2019t remember that so I can\u2019t find that. But I don\u2019t know who made it or what it exactly looked like.  But the other recorder I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200455\">had, that my mom used for her interviews, I found that. It was this 1980s professional Sony. So those are all separate phases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: And also just creating an attachment to objects...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562552\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: ...can be really important [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, very intimate relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, or even as you\u2019re describing that downstairs mall, it\u2019s like that\u2019s so... the record store, the photo booth, the lingerie, that\u2019s so your mind in a way. It\u2019s sort of... I can imagine that feeling kind of like a home away from home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Well even the ice cream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Ice cream, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Kind of like cozy comfort food. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: That sounds like you. It might not sound like every person, but it\u2019s so your attachments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was so like that. You could never do that now. That was so 70s, 80s kind of. I mean it was a risqu\u00e9 store, in a fucking mall. I don\u2019t know how they did that. Or how I even got to go in there with... because I never went to that mall alone, so how... that they would just let me go in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">there, both my family and the store people. It\u2019s crazy. And... but I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Were you with... would you go into that area with your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: I was always with adults, yeah. Yeah, because I was too young to go there by myself. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: They wouldn\u2019t let you go... run off, though, to your own section [inaudible] that old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t remember that. Maybe they did.  I don\u2019t remember. Maybe back then it was more like they wouldn\u2019t be as paranoid as they would be now. I don\u2019t know. That I don\u2019t remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: You weren\u2019t going in the lingerie store with your mother, or were you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I\u2019m saying... well not just my mom but like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: With other family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, the family, my dad, my mom, whatever. Or if her sister was visiting or... I don\u2019t know, I just remember being in there sometimes with family. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s [inaudible] in other words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean that\u2019s what I remember because there\u2019s no other way I could have gone in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So someone was shopping for the lingerie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: No idea. I think for them it was kind of like coming to the Square in the 60s. I think it was a bit of a freak show. Or not a freak show but it was like oh, look at that, look at that. Weird. So in some ways I think it was half a joke. But... so maybe that\u2019s why I thought it was just funnier. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">But I don\u2019t know. Or maybe they were more concerned than I remember but not concerned enough to be like you\u2019re not going anywhere.  They weren\u2019t yelling at me. So maybe I didn\u2019t go all the way in and I just remember just a little front part or something. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like I was walking around <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">and they were shopping for shit. I know that wasn\u2019t the case but... yeah. And the record store I do remember being allowed to kind of wander a little bit. So I even went back and found some of the records that were more obscure, like a George... I have this 45 by George Harrison. I was like I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200713\">kind of see what it looks like. I was like what the fuck was that song? And of course the guy has like 3 million... but I found it.  Wikipedia, it\u2019s like a list of all his singles. And I just looked at the ones that were around that year or two, listened to all of them, and I found it. Or like Elvis, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200714\">weird cover of him standing on a painted road with a rainbow or some shit. Found that one. Yeah, crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Comforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, those were the... put them on, I would lip sync to them, and that\u2019s, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how I learned to play the guitar. I have no idea. But it must be. I don\u2019t know how I learned but maybe that\u2019ll come back to me. I don\u2019t know. But I can\u2019t quite remember. I\u2019m assuming it was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">banging on it while listening to these songs. It\u2019s cool.  I think this blog is a great way to kind of work on a book without thinking of it that way. You know what I mean? A lot of these things could be much longer but they\u2019re blog posts so they\u2019re... you know what I mean? So it kind of actually takes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">the pressure off of a lot of things. And after you publish it you can go back and revise it, obviously, so it\u2019s kind of a good way to... especially this forum, the blog, the site that I use is so made for just writing. This guy\u2019s made it... it\u2019s the same guy that did Twitter. It\u2019s just really easy and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200753\">looks nice and just focus on the writing instead of just all this other shit. It\u2019s pretty cool. So I\u2019m kind of using it as an organizational... I still have a shitload of titles and things and it was [inaudible] all in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562552\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: Like a place to start gathering your memories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, because he\u2019s done such a good job of... you go into your little dashboard and just... there\u2019s just a very nice list of things and it\u2019s all... and I can... very sparse and clean and\u2026 especially because some of them relate to others so you can edit. Oh, you know what, those aren\u2019t two essays, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">that\u2019s one essay, or whatever. You know what I mean? You can kind of play around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Find your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: With all the... I think there\u2019s something special about it being sparse [inaudible] overstimulation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, kind of like my apartment, the way I\u2019ve just... yeah. Or just how I\u2019ve been organizing my days. Like that chick Selena wants to come over today. I\u2019m like no. I\u2019m going to my Assyrian friend\u2019s house to have some whiskey and just hang out. That\u2019s what I\u2019d rather be doing. I asked the chair <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">of the department at the university, I was like I\u2019m kind of writing... I\u2019m ramping up my output and getting ready to publish [inaudible] so I was like can I start saying that I... that\u2019s where I work. You\u2019ve got to send a bio and this and that. So I just want it to be more concrete. I mean that\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: Do you have a center to [inaudible] or what are your days going to look like when you first get there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to write off the first two months I think. It\u2019s a write off. Because I think it\u2019s just going to be all sensory overload, just absorbing and just kind of being... a lot of mixed feelings and this and that and just... I think every day there are going to be moments where I\u2019m sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">somewhere, I\u2019m going to be like holy shit, this isn\u2019t just a caf\u00e9, it\u2019s an Assyrian caf\u00e9 in Assyria, where everyone\u2019s fucking... I mean just that I think those kinds of things are going to keep hitting me. Oh look, all the signs are in Assyrian. That\u2019s fucking weird. Or oh look, we\u2019re walking by a building <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200852\">and holy shit there\u2019s Mt. Ararat, that\u2019s like a fabled mountains where Noah\u2019s ark landed.  I mean it\u2019s just weird. So I mean this is all going to be a lot of weird shit. People. I\u2019ve heard that when you first get there, especially if you already know some people, it\u2019s just a deluge of meeting people <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200853\">and hanging out with people, then meeting other people and being invited here and being invited there and all that. That\u2019s my... that\u2019s what every single person\u2019s told me, so that\u2019s the sense I get. So I think I\u2019m just not pressuring... I think those first few months, like month or two, just need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200854\">kind of just be. You know what I mean? But then what I see, what I envision, is hopefully... but that\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m worried about. I really want to make sure I have a relatively quiet apartment. These countries... America\u2019s the only place where this whole peace and quiet thing is a big deal.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200855\">You go to Europe and stuff and people just... it\u2019s the weirdest thing, just everyone listens to this shitty techno music and there\u2019s a little bit more.... or a little bit less personal space things in that part of the world. So I just really want to find a place where... because the plan is desk, Cecelia, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200856\">and just a lot of writing, a lot of just... I mean in a way it\u2019s perfect. No car, a lot of walking, which will be really good. Not just for exercise but just gets your mind... and then yeah, just a lot of writing. And playing music. But mostly, I think, writing. And more organized because this shit\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200857\">got to get done. So\u2026 so yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019ll be interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562552\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t [inaudible] work before...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Oh no, sure I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There\u2019s just nothing I can do about that right now. And just like... you know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Oh, I know that, I just didn\u2019t know if that was a part of the plan was to something [inaudible] job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: It absolutely is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it absolutely is. Not just temporary. I mean like I said, if I found something really good, I mean if I found something amazing that\u2019s full time, and then I would just flip things and be like you know what?  I can only teach one or two at the most at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200911\">university. This is what I want to be doing right now. But I think what\u2019s going to happen is just find something that\u2019s part time that\u2019s good and just even keep it when I\u2019m at the university. Or I know that everyone there is like you\u2019ll always be able to make money tutoring, you\u2019ll always be able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200912\">make money... I was saying, their websites over there, there\u2019s always something about them. Even the good ones. That you\u2019ll get to the last paragraph and be like oh, that\u2019s weird syntax and weird word choices. So I could even kind of contract type stuff. So that one I have no choice but to just trust <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200913\">all these people that are telling me to just not worry about it.  And this one woman, who I really think is going to be helpful, the one I was saying from Yale, so I\u2019m hoping something will happen fairly soon. And then tomorrow I\u2019ll find out when those classes start in the summer. That way I\u2019ll know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200914\">exactly how long do I need to... like first of all, what does that pay, but second of all, how many months do I have to kind of just get by until I have a real\u2026 yeah. Because I really won\u2019t need much, but once this apartment\u2019s rented, I mean whatever my mom sends me from here will pretty much pay my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200915\">rent. So no car insurance, no major other bills, just Internet, whatever. I shouldn\u2019t need that\u2026 initially, I shouldn\u2019t need that much to just kind of be okay.  We\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t know. One thing I\u2019ve totally forgotten, too, about renting an apartment, I totally forgot, that it\u2019s fucking Assyria. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200916\">mean I could always just get there and be like you know what? For one month I just want to rent this place. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562552\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re not going to have a year lease you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">CLIENT: There are places, there are plenty of places where there\u2019s so many people visiting, it\u2019s just a different place. Be like hey man, I want to rent this apartment. I\u2019ll give you $400 for the month or whatever it is until I get my bearings and find one I really, really want and... yeah. So I might <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">just do something like that when I get...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: Rather than crashing with someone else for two months or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Well no, that was never going to happen anyway. I was very... I don\u2019t want to do that.  But instead of rushing, just be like look, I\u2019m just... let me rent a place for a month and get my bearings and figure it out. Or ask my Assyrian\u2026 I just thought of this now, but ask my Assyrian friend who <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200991\">has the apartment, be like hey man, I\u2019m going to be there two weeks anyway, can I just pay you and stay there four weeks? Why didn\u2019t I do that? I should just do that. Because I mean I have a feeling their place is really, really nice. They come from a lot of money and they\u2019re nice people. As long as <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200992\">they don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s not the summer months yet, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s becoming ever more tangible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, no it is for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: The details are coming alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, yesterday I went to the store and bought a pair of jeans a shirt and stuff. I\u2019m like wow. It\u2019s funny. I\u2019ve got to buy some black... just a pair of black shoes. I\u2019ve got to start weighing. They\u2019re such bastards. If your luggage is over 50 pounds you\u2019re fucked. Which I don\u2019t even know how <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">people... that\u2019s... I don\u2019t... that seems very light to me.

You know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, no, of course you can, but $200 for Cecelia, another whatever the fuck, $100, for a stupid \u2018nother luggage?

I mean in some ways I don\u2019t mind. I think it forces you to just be like what the fuck, how many jackets do I need. I mean two pairs of jeans, whatever, two other pairs of pants. I mean it\u2019s not a... it\u2019s not the desert. I mean once I really need something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">I\u2019ll go get it. Yeah, things are a little more expensive there but whatever. I mean those kinds of things.
