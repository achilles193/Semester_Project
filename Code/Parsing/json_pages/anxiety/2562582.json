Let me know, if you can, beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Is there a certain day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Wednesday, Thursday should be okay. Is it bad that I\u2019m taking Cecelia to Assyria? I was thinking about this. I somehow feel guilty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Feel guilty?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Some of my friends don\u2019t get it. They\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re attached, but it\u2019s a cat. You\u2019re taking her thousands of miles with you. It\u2019s kind of a hassle.  Then I do feel kind of guilty because my mom loves her so much. Part of me thinks it would be the right thing to do, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">leave her, because it makes my mom happy. Then I\u2019m like no, it\u2019s my cat. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: So you feel guilty towards your mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: God, I\u2019m so attached to this fucking cat I want to take it with me halfway around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Why should you feel guilty from your attachment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if guilty is the right word. It\u2019s making me think whether it\u2019s better for the cat to leave her in the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Not good for her then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. Whatever, I\u2019m going to take her. I\u2019m too attached.  My friend was like, \u201cAt the most, they might bribe you at Customs at the airport. Just have some cash on you. They\u2019re going to see you have a fucking cat and they might just be like \u2018Yeah, I can get some money out of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">guy.\u2019 At the most, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. And also print out all the laws that you saw online in case they are like \u2018whoops \u2013 this cat . . .\u2019 Then you can tell them that it\u2019s actually a law right here, so what do we need to do to hurry this along?\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re ambivalent about it, about doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not. I want to take her. Since there is a way to take her, I want to take her.  Also my friend was like, \u201cDude, it\u2019s a country. People bring in cats and dogs all the time. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one bringing in a pet? From Asia and stuff, people bring in dogs.\u201d I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">I\u2019m maybe just surprised at myself for being so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: That sounds more the question, what does it mean that I\u2019m attached?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that I\u2019m just so attached to this cat. That\u2019s the thing. I told some of my friends, \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. I know I\u2019m saying this because it\u2019s my cat, but honestly, I\u2019ve never seen a cat . . . She\u2019s just so full of love and so affectionate. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m just so attached to her.\u201d  And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">in some ways, I feel like if I left her with my mom, my mom loves her, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for the cat either. She\u2019s used to sleeping a certain . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You. She\u2019s attached to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. And cats get over that. I know they\u2019re not dogs, but still if there were a way to take her, why wouldn\u2019t I take her? And I told my mom, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get you one like her?\u201d It\u2019s a rag doll. They\u2019re all beautiful. She\u2019s like, \u201cNo, but I love her.\u201d \u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to take care of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">her.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d I guess it\u2019s nice. I like seeing my mom \u2013 she gets so happy with her, so I don\u2019t know if I should just surprise her and just get her one and then she\u2019ll just be like she was with Cecelia. Once I\u2019ve bought her then, of course, then she loved it. She says she doesn\u2019t want to actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">have to take care of all the logistical stuff that you have to do to take care of a cat, but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562582\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not so sure she means that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: On the one hand, I get that she really does mean it. Between my grandmother \u2013 brushing it, cleaning it, making sure it\u2019s okay, feeding it twice a day or whatever \u2013 it\u2019s a commitment. On the other hand, I see how happy she gets, so I don\u2019t know. On some level it\u2019s just another way to busy my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">mind. It\u2019s like a distraction. I\u2019m getting more excited to go now. I\u2019m starting to feel okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Does this mean that you\u2019re buying a plane ticket soon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I should. It\u2019s going to be even more expensive if I buy it two weeks before, so yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Have you looked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. There is one route that\u2019s the one I want to take. The other ones are way too long and too many stops. There is a simple Darien-Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Assyria, so that\u2019s the one; but that\u2019s not every day, so I\u2019m looking at it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: To me you sound more excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, it just feels right. It feels like a good adventure. Shake things up, kind of \u2013 job, cheaper lifestyle. There are really not negatives that I can think of. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Are there a few you can think of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: To going? Not really negatives, just things that you have to give up. Obviously my friends, my family . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean. There are negatives; there are losses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Reasons you wouldn\u2019t. Those really aren\u2019t reasons for me not to. I\u2019ve never been like that. If I feel like there is a big move I have to make, I suck it up and I do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean reasons that would make you not do it, but if you\u2019re looking at the pros and cons, every single thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I guess I just don\u2019t think of it as a negative, because that has a bad connotation; but yeah, you\u2019re right, there are things. Of course, I\u2019m going to miss people. I love Darien. Yeah, of course. Of course. Overall, I do have a comfortable set-up here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: There is your band.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. Them, too. Not enough to . . . They don\u2019t outweigh the good stuff that probably seems like is going to happen there. Also, the thing is so what? Even if those things don\u2019t happen I\u2019m going to turn around and come back to Darien, which is all still going to be here. Yeah, maybe we won\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">be able to get the band back together, but that\u2019s not enough of a reason.  (pause) Now it\u2019s almost like a weird waiting. I\u2019m in this weird place now. I know I\u2019m going, so part of me has already kind of checked out somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: You feel like you do know you\u2019re going at this point? You\u2019re sure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I know that may sound strange to ask you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: No, because I\u2019ve asked myself that. It\u2019s good to be articulated because, again, what I\u2019m doing is so different this time.  I\u2019m such a different person. I can even go in March and come back in fucking April. I could come back two weeks later if I want. I\u2019m not signing my soul away to the devil <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">or something. It seems like a great opportunity. If I get there and it\u2019s somehow a complete fucking nightmare, (laughs) I am going to get on a plane and come back to this, which is all still going to be here. When I think of it like this, why wouldn\u2019t I go? I\u2019ve never been there, so I have many good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">reasons to go there. There is nothing keeping me there. If I don\u2019t like it I\u2019m going to come back. That way it deflates some of the \u201coh, this is such a huge . . .\u201d as if it\u2019s some sort of no-turning-back kind of thing, which I don\u2019t want.  That\u2019s generally the way I\u2019ve been. Everything has this loaded, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200593\">symbolic . . . There is no reason for this to feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562582\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Do you have a sense about when you\u2019d like to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: March.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Definitely March?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And why March versus April?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: The cold will start thawing. April because why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re ready to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, what am I doing? And also because at the end of May is when really tourists, the people that live in Assyria over the summer, it\u2019s hot as fuck. It\u2019s like Darien but without enough air conditioning \u2013 that humid, hot . . . So I don\u2019t want to show up in June kind of frazzled. The summer is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">going to go like that, trying to find an apartment in the high season.  Go in March, ease into things while things are still in a regular, every day hustle and bustle. I have one or two friends whose apartments might be empty. It\u2019s that time of year where their families might not \u2013 you know. It might <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">be easier to stay there. I can just maybe crash somewhere quickly and then just find a place. Also before I actually start work work, I\u2019m already acclimated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Settled down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel comfortable more or less. I\u2019m not lost. I get on the subway and here\u2019s the school; I\u2019ve been to the office. I don\u2019t know. Also just to enjoy it. It\u2019s not Berlin, it\u2019s Assyria, so I just want to soak it in.  I know that everyone has said it just takes time to do. It is a kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">emotional, unreal kind of experience because it\u2019s so built up in the diaspora. As much as I\u2019m going without those romanticized things, it does hit you when you get there. It\u2019s a very beautiful landscape, whether you like it or not. There is just so much. It\u2019s so ancient. It\u2019s so beautiful. Also financially. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">Just rent this fucking thing. If my mom puts $400 in my account every month, that\u2019s my rent.  If I get some job doing whatever . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Is it like a work Visa?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: The school will be doing that. With Assyria she was like \u201cnobody really cares here.\u201d They\u2019re so happy to have people come and who are qualified. It\u2019s not an EU-type of cluster fuck. As a matter of fact, what will probably happen is I\u2019ll just get a ten-year pass, like a citizenship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Hmm, that\u2019s easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like $300. I can do everything but . . . I can buy property and I can work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a passport and everything.  When I get there they give me some kind of \u2013 not a Social Security number, but a work number, to be able to pay you. That\u2019s the good stuff. It\u2019s a cluster fuck on some level, but on the other hand they\u2019re still not that bureaucratic black and white, so it\u2019s pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">cool. (pause) I also want to get there sooner than later because my mind will be at ease. Getting there and realizing that I am teaching two or three classes. I feel like I need to be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562582\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you need to get there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Because right now it\u2019s like sure, one or two classes, but really when I\u2019m there they might even be like, \u201cWow, you came.

All I\u2019m going to need is a grand <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">a month. $500 rent, $10 for fiber optic cable, no car, no nothing, some food, so making around $13,000 for a semester \u2013 Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d start teaching in the summer then? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the other thing, I might be able to teach summer courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: That would be the hope, I assume?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: That\u2019s my hope because if I get there early I can pick up a class or two in the summer. Also there are just a lot of jobs there. Maybe I can do some marketing shit on the side. There is all this stuff. All their websites are kind of professional, but I could do a whole business of just rewriting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">their websites, all these Assyrian sites. They seem perfect, then you get to a couple of sentences and are like no, this is clearly not a native speaker. If I did things on the side and made $100 here and $200 there . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: You could fill in, you think, in some ways getting to the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Exactly. I\u2019d want to hit the ground running with some income, especially if my rent is almost going to be paid from here. I can start working and doing some stuff.  I think I still want to do that even when teaching. I\u2019ll fucking do some shit on the side. I don\u2019t care. Revamp some websites or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">whatever. Teaching three classes; are you kidding? Especially when they\u2019re not like graduate seminars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: We need to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Wednesday? Awesome. Have a great weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: You, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
