We talked for almost an hour, actually. I feel like 85% of the time, our phone conversations are sort of like \u2013 he\u2019ll call to check in very briefly when he is on the way to do something, and then one or the other of us will be like, \u201cWell, gotta go.\u201d Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">\u201cGood to talk to you.\u201d Then, very occasionally, we sort of hit the point where both of us actually want to talk, and then it goes from there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">I was telling him about this conference that I went to, and talked to the (inaudible) people and (inaudible) that. It was good. (pause) I asked him \u2013 I don\u2019t remember how this came up, but he was sort of telling me about something. I think we were talking about, like you have to do a psychological evaluation <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">at some point, like right before you get ordained (inaudible at 00:01:42), or something like that, like when you\u2019re already in seminary, basically. He said that he sort of (inaudible at 00:01:59) that, and I\u2019m like, \u201cGone back to talk to the guy and talk about what he was going to do, and especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">to talk about stuff about Mom,\u201d I think, at this point, he was ordained the year that I was born, so I think he met Mom in seminary, and I think they probably got married like his second year in seminary, or something like that. So I asked him, \u201cDid you know before you married Mom, the scope of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">issues with her?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo.\u201d (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I think I sort of threw him. I said, \u201cYou might not want to answer this.\u201d He said he would be up for talking about it, but probably not over the phone. I think he was worried that c you know, in some ways I was asking because I feel like I was asking because of what\u2019s been going on with me and James. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">But I think he was worried that I would draw parallels too strongly and too firmly, and he was very clear. He was like, \u201cYou know, the stuff that is happening with you and James is very, very different from what things were with your mom.\u201d (pause 00:03:35 \u2013 00:04:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Yeah. I don\u2019t know that much about the early days of my parents\u2019 marriage. I\u2019m very curious about it. (pause 00:04:20 \u2013 00:04:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">He said once like, \u201cAt some point, there\u2019s competition. If you thought I was angry with you growing up, you should have seen me at X time.\u201d I don\u2019t exactly remember when X time was, but sometime before I was born. I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d and he\u2019s like \u201cWell, maybe.\u201d (laughter) I think it was sort of a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">\u2013 he made the joke, and then he immediately felt like maybe that wasn\u2019t a good joke. (laughter) I was like, \u201cYep, not that good of a joke.\u201d Still a little prickly there. Give it another decade maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So James was the captain of the volleyball team in college, and it was a very close-knit community with a lot of deliberately cultivated traditions. And so one of the things that they say is, \u201cIt\u2019s never too soon to make a joke about something.\u201d (laughter) Which, you know, like \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">of feel like volleyball, too, embodies all that is terrible and also good about college kids. But they actually sort of lived up to it. The year after James graduated, when the coach and one of the other students died in a car crash, somebody made a joke about Isaac dying, like, while they were in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">hospital after Isaac died. It was pretty terrible, but I think it was also what everybody wanted. I think it helped them. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562250\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">So every time I get like, \u201cIs it really appropriate for me to make a joke about this?\u201d I remember Isaac Hall\u2019s (ph) thing, \u201cIt\u2019s never too soon.\u201d (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">Another friend of James\u2019s named Isaac \u2013 (inaudible at 00:07:57) Victor, because he works with him in the same lab, just managed to make the compound that he\u2019s been trying to make for, not only his entire doctoral degree, but like four students before him have spent their entire careers on it. Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">Victor was pretty pleased.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Wow, an alchemy project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Pretty much. I mean, he said he thought of the idea, and he\u2019s like, \u201cYep, about 25 years ago is when I first thought of this idea,\u201d so that was nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">(pause 00:08:40 \u2013 00:09:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just thinking that somewhere in there between your deciding it was too soon for your dad to make that joke and remembering the volleyball team is how much you want to be able to handle stuff like that in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Even when you can\u2019t. (pause) Like there\u2019s some secondary question about sturdiness (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Mmm, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s really important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I\u2019ve been watching \u201cFriends\u201d because of the movie coming up, which I\u2019d kind of like to see that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that good. Anyway, I\u2019m re-watching this show, and it\u2019s a really great show. There\u2019s one episode near the beginning that just every time I watch it, I think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">\u201cAh, I really wish he didn\u2019t deal with this.\u201d Like, he\u2019s talking\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t know anything about\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Okay, it\u2019s a good show, but there\u2019s an episode near the beginning where one of the main characters \u2013 his sister was murdered like a year ago, and we find out later out in the season that his parents think he was the one who killed his sister because he has type 4 epilepsy and was in the middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">of an episode and sort of catatonic when they came home, and he had blood all over him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Anyway, and so he\u2019s taking antidepressants because he\u2019s sad because his sister died, and he decides to, abruptly and on his own volition, decides he doesn\u2019t want to do this anymore and decides to go off them and has a very bad reaction to dropping antidepressants cold turkey. They never tell us what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">they are \u2013 probably because they\u2019re not being very specific and didn\u2019t want to actually do research \u2013 but including nausea and weird behavior and also hallucinations. At the end of the episode, he decides to go back on them. The way that it\u2019s framed is that he\u2019s trying to \u2013 that he\u2019s taking antidepressants <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">and continuing to do it because he\u2019s trying to avoid dealing with all the unexplained stuff about his sister\u2019s death, as well as all the (inaudible 00:12:59), so it seems like a copout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">And that just makes me so mad (laughter) in many ways. I think the larger point is to talk about his parents who were like, \u201cWell, you know, you should take medication instead of actually grieving because we don\u2019t want to deal with your grief because it\u2019s inconvenient,\u201d and that sort of (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">00:13:25). But it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, medication withdrawal is a real thing.\u201d It can be tough and scary, and it\u2019s not a moral weakness not to want to hallucinate your dead sister. (laughter) I don\u2019t know; I tried to talk to James about it, and he sort of listened, but he also was saying like, \u201cWell, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">you just don\u2019t really understand what he was trying to do with this,\u201d like, \u201cLet me explain the theme of the show to you.\u201d (laughter) And I\u2019m like, \u201cI got it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562250\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, I love when he does that. (laughter) Yeah, so that was so funny. \u201cNo, no, I understand what he\u2019s doing here,\u201d and I think that the points that he is making (inaudible at 00:14:29), I think he makes rather well. The problem is that the things that he\u2019s saying have unintended <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">\u2013 that what he\u2019s writing says things that he didn\u2019t mean it to say. Everything that you write says something that you didn\u2019t mean it to say, but it\u2019s incumbent on you to pay some attention to some of the things that it might say, and do your research. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I followed (ph) the point about this implication of a kind of moral failing or weakness of character related to the effect of the withdrawal seemed unintended, in contrast to the kind of difficult and intended point about his parents saying, \u201cNo, don\u2019t grieve now. It\u2019s inconvenient for us <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">to [just end them].\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I think he also did intend to say that the character was a weak character. I think he was trying to say that the character is somebody who doesn\u2019t want to face what\u2019s in front of him, and is sort of hiding from this truth. I just think it\u2019s a really unfortunate choice of ways to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">say that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">But, I guess I sort of started telling you, it\u2019s not that big of deal, but it just gets me, and I don\u2019t want it to get me, but it just does. I don\u2019t want it to bother \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t take medication. (laughter) It\u2019s something like this is sort of an academic point for me right now, but [at moments] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">(ph) it\u2019s very frustrating to me that I don\u2019t take medication because it\u2019s very frustrating to me that I\u2019ve spent a year or two trying to find some things that would help, and it doesn\u2019t help. Um, yeah. Um\u2026  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">I have sort of like this constellation of sensitivity that it\u2019s hard to be okay with. I\u2019m getting more okay with it, but (pause) yeah. (pause) The other thing I find very frustrating about the episode is that his mom is like, \u201cYou know, lots of people take antidepressants. What has it been? It\u2019s only <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">been like six months; you just have to give it a little more time to work.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cSix months? Really?\u201d (laughter) Who is this guy\u2019s psychiatrist, because you should fire him. That\u2019s not how it works. (laughter)  And the whole way that they write about it is so \u2013 you can tell that the writers don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">have any actual experience with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Kind of remarkable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s really surprising to me, or you can tell that \u2013 either they don\u2019t have any actual experience, or they don\u2019t care enough to write things accurately because they talk about these very extreme withdrawal symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I\u2019m like, \u201cI get that that\u2019s sort of a plot point, but there aren\u2019t that many standard antidepressants that have those withdrawal symptoms, in part, because they wouldn\u2019t be prescribed so widely if they were so\u2014\u201d I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just \u2013 it gets under my skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562250\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause 00:19:13 \u2013 00:20:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">Well, I think it\u2019s because with yourself, you can become (ph) the same way. Isn\u2019t it the same thing to \u2013 you\u2019re kind of mad at yourself, or feel like it is a moral failing of yours, if it is too soon for your dad to make the joke?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) It\u2019s like the same thing as what? I lost the comparison.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure. The same thing as the (pause) \u2013 you felt like it was unfair of the writers to present this guy as having a moral failing for not being able to deal with his withdrawal symptoms from the medication. You\u2019re mad at them for essentially saying he was weak. As you\u2014? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s exactly right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: And I guess it seemed to me similar when you were talking about the thing with your dad because you reached right for the volleyball team in a, I think, at bottom (ph), kind of admiring way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: At least on this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, no. It is sort of admiring, but even as I say it, I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d (laughter) No, I think you\u2019re right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But I guess, to me, what the volleyball team brings out, is that it\u2019s really important to those guys to feel like \u2013 at least, a big piece of it was \u2013 whatever happens, this is a sign that we can deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: If we can be funny about it, if we can joke about it, then it means we\u2019re kind of handling it, or we can handle it.

(pause) I feel like, with James, when I talk about things that hurt me like that, (pause) I feel like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: The show? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, like the show and just other places where I\u2019m sensitive. I feel like somewhere things break down because I want to be saying, \u201cThis hurts me,\u201d and what he hears is, \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be doing it this way because this hurts me,\u201d or like, \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for people to do this because it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">hurts me.\u201d And sometimes I think that it is, and sometimes, just people get hurt \u2013 you just get hurt; that\u2019s how it is. (pause) But I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know.

You wanted to say you weren\u2019t feeling that great, that it\u2019s kind of hard to put your thoughts together or something, and my hunch is that that\u2019s difficult or gets under your skin in a similar way. It makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">you feel like you\u2019re not as together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: In a way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: I think the thing with not being able to articulate things and not being able to talk is also like I feel like it\u2019s on me to be able to explain myself so that people can help. So if I can\u2019t say it, then it\u2019s somehow my fault that things are hurtful to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess, I just feel like it\u2019s particularly a thing here, but it\u2019s also just in my life. I feel like it\u2019s really important that I be able to be clear about what I say, that I be able to use my words. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s actually the same thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I think so, maybe from a little bit of a different angle. (pause) It seems like wanting to ward off a slightly different kind of vulnerability to the other person. Maybe it\u2019s not that you have to be sort of together and able to handle X, Y, or Z, but it\u2019s definitely on you, no matter how <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">upset you are, to be clear and articulate so that you\u2019re not putting that on them, or you\u2019re not putting yourself in their hands in a kind of semi-coherent way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562250\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I get that it\u2019s scarier, and I get that in certain circumstances, that could be worse.  When it\u2019s somebody you don\u2019t know very well, or you\u2026 I guess, to me, the clearer thing seems to be that it really puts you in danger <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">of getting hurt worse, especially if the person gives some indication that they don\u2019t want to deal with it, like they don\u2019t want to deal with you with it, or something like that. I mean, it seems closer to the risk of \u2013 I can\u2019t (ph) imagine you\u2019re driving somebody away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: But, I guess, for example, I\u2019m thinking, like between you and me, I\u2019m not aware that, in general, the times when you\u2019re having a more difficult time explaining yourself, it really\u2026 It could go this way, just continue to be what happens, where then either I don\u2019t get something, or you wind <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">up explaining something in a way where I\u2019m on totally a different page, and I say something that hurts, or you feel really misunderstood. That happens sometimes with you, but not, I don\u2019t think, what needs (ph) to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Um-hum.

I think one of the things \u2013 feeling like I have to be able to explain myself is \u2013 it seems sort of ridiculous to me that anyone would try to understand me if I make it harder for them. I feel like if I can\u2019t explain things well, then people aren\u2019t going to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">an extra step toward me to figure it out and [see what happened] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: I see.
