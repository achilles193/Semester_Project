It generally happens with Jeremy a lot and it sometimes happens with my parents.  It\u2019s the same anxious confusion about what to share and how to do it and how fast to do it, what the order should be, what the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">pacing should be. It\u2019s not premeditated. As I\u2019m telling the story I\u2019m constantly gauging what\u2019s sinking in with them and where they\u2019re reacting, how much they\u2019re going to be able to share with me during and after.  (pause) it\u2019s like I just want the information to get to them. I don\u2019t really want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">be involved in telling it \u2013 or I do, but I have to be so specific about that process; and then there is not that much time left for what I think they care more about, which is connecting about it.  If I really cared about connecting about it only, I think it wouldn\u2019t matter so much how I said it. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">like connecting, but maybe I feel like I have to connect in a specific way in order to feel good. I don\u2019t know. It certainly happens with Jeremy a lot. I\u2019ll come home and want to tell him something and I\u2019ll be worked up about how he\u2019s going to listen and what\u2019s going to reach in and tell him [ ]. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I imagine the pickle you\u2019re in there (laughs) is that there are lots of micro-moments of connection and disconnection; and it\u2019s different from, let\u2019s say, meeting somebody new and trying to connect with them because you have an agenda. You don\u2019t just want to connect, you want to connect around <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">something that is important to you; and so I think that\u2019s part of where the push and pull gets set up because your two goals are to convey something that matters to you and to connect around it.  There are lots of micro-moments having that happen and not having that happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yes. It throws me off. It\u2019s so effortless for me to meet new people. After an entire day of it I get tired, but in terms of the actual interaction or just regular people that I see every day because then I don\u2019t care as much. Those are the easiest interactions for me. I do; I connect with the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">doorman and the cafeteria woman and the custodian and the administrator; and with all of those connections, it doesn\u2019t matter to me what I say to them. Whatever I say is good and whatever they say to me is good.  It\u2019s going to be fine. When Jeremy asked me to marry him \u2013 did I tell you that story? It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">very cute. The day after he asked me to marry him, we called like 35 people. It was the same (chuckles) incredibly labor-intensive process and laughing because it was [an impression of] (ph?). . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking about that. Four?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Four [impression] (ph?) four-hour wedding invitation and thank you note process, which was like seven months of \u201cJeremy, when are you going to carve the fucking block?\u201d \u201cJeremy, when are you going to carve the fucking block?\u201d We did a lino cut; he did lino-cut carvings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: For the thank you cards and invitations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: The invitations, Samantha painted. The \u201csave the day\u201d was a hand-carved thing and I did the border for each, but he did the actual letters. It was both of us not doing it and then doing it and not doing it and there was a lot of nagging.  Basically, it just took forever and then it was eight <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">or nine months from our wedding and it was like shit, we need to write really good ones. We wrote (sighs) like journal entries to each person, like \u201c. . . and the Fagor pressure cooker. We most enjoy cooking pigeon peas and this kind of beans and we recently just made this and this and we use it all <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">the time. We love it so much. Thank you so much for . . .\u201d Blah, blah, blah to everyone and there were 150. So this phone call (laughs) (inaudible at 00:09:27) was kind of like that. There wasn\u2019t any of that and we were so happy.  There wasn\u2019t really a negative thing to write the thank-you notes, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">the phone calls were like every person had to \u2013 I thought that every person had to hear the whole story. I really wanted to give lead time for what they had to say about it and what they had to say to us. Most of it was on speaker phone. Jeremy and I took turns doing most of the talking. On that day, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">Jeremy was like, \u201cGod, Allison, can\u2019t you figure out a different way to tell the story?\u201d He was really annoyed that I had to use the same arc.  This happens once in a while when something big happens and I want to tell a lot of people. Or it\u2019s something really, really important to me and I only want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200195\">to tell a few people, but I tell it the same way. This reminds me of that. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t think of a different way to tell it. It was really hard for me. I tried to use synonyms. (laughs) That\u2019s not really what he meant. He meant the entire arc.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562292\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: You have a thesaurus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s the extent of my diversity.  I think I know what he meant. I still can\u2019t figure out how I would do it. If it were Jeremy, he would let it completely unfold with each person in a different way. He wouldn\u2019t have any agenda except that Allison and I are getting married. I was way too <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">attached to how it happened and making sure that people knew that Jeremy was so great for what he did. I had a lot of agendas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I think that maybe also part of what\u2019s tricky is I think it\u2019s easier for you to think more about wanting the connection part and not as easy or comfortable to think about all of the agendas that you have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like yesterday\u2019s story was probably packed with agendas, but I haven\u2019t unpacked that. I don\u2019t talk about Jeremy much with you. That was not lost on me and it was significant; and I guess I had some agenda around this is the first time I\u2019m really talking about Jeremy a lot \u2013 or like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">second or the third. I guess I wanted to make sure that I got it right, that I got him right for you.  Then there is \u201cI wonder how much Jay knows about things?\u201d (pause) I started watching you for that and asking you about it, like wondering [when to ask.] (ph?) (pause)  I think it was pretty important <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">for me to convey to you that I let go a bunch on Monday night \u2013 that was an agenda \u2013 and that was really hard for me. Maybe I thought you\u2019d be proud. (pause) I guess I don\u2019t express frustration about Jeremy really to anyone anymore.  Those are old feelings that are feeling new again, so I was sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">exploring that, like seeing how they were different from four or five years ago; seeing how they were the same. (long pause)  I\u2019ve got some things that I don\u2019t really remember. Three little things that I remember are me and some guy that I was sleeping with who is not Jeremy, walking in a very part <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">of Los Angeles, my wallet in my left pocket and my phone in my right pocket and some huge thing \u2013 a musical instrument or something \u2013 that I was carrying.  I was supposed to be hyper-aware of pickpockets. I am often. You sort of just get that sense in really crowded developing world cities and in Los <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200215\">Angeles they\u2019ve got pickpockets. It\u2019s a little silly to be hyper-aware of that in Waltham, but I am. I have that sense about me. I kept checking my pockets. But I have this instrument so it\u2019s hard. The guy sort of reminded me to be careful. We were walking and that was one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562292\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">The other thing is that I guess we got to our destination, which is this big, old house where there was a huge family gathering. It\u2019s a pretty classic dream setup for me. There are different parts of my family and Jeremy\u2019s family, lots of people, lots of different rooms.  I was going to sleep with this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">guy or wanted to or had some really mixed tense thing going on with him. I\u2019m sure Jeremy was somewhere with all his family around and all in the hallway. I sort of had a lot going on in my head about this guy and the family, how it was all going to work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">The third scene was like I had explosive diarrhea but somehow landed on the toilet seat cover.  It was very thoroughly covered with poop and I was cleaning it with toilet paper. It was taking forever and it was very, very gross. It was also very scary that that much poop had managed to go somewhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">where it had never physically been possible. I think my mom came in and I was embarrassed or nervous and she was trying to help me or see what was going on.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">I also dreamt \u2013 separately, I think \u2013 that I had finally asked you what you had majored in in college and you said \u201cFrench\u201d (both laugh) in this very \u201cJay\u201d voice. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: My associations to the first and third of those are to what we\u2019ve been talking about, the sense with the arc that you are similarly vigilant and don\u2019t want to lose time. You want to kind of keep it all in. But then as we look at it, (laughs) I think it feels like \u2013 ugh, that\u2019s just more of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">your crap and it\u2019s more visible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: My crap? Yeah.  It\u2019s actually like it\u2019s uncontainable. I can\u2019t keep it in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I guess also \u2013 I didn\u2019t think of this until just now \u2013 it reminds me of the thing about there almost being a kind of aesthetic which, I guess, feels very much violated, like the grossness that you mentioned and feeling ashamed about it, I think, seems contrary to this effort to come across <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">or present yourself and what you have to say in a certain way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that. I think it\u2019s like somebody appears really intricate and confused in their language. It usually stems from a lot of cloudiness in my mind \u2013 in my own experience and in other people\u2019s experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some deliberate premeditated effort to have you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">something very specific or have you think of me in a very specific way.  This is too big and too confusing, too complex. And then being with you and having you share it with me is too big and too important, too complex; and I\u2019m feeling around in the dark is how I feel. I want it to go a certain way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">but I\u2019m not really too conscious of what that way is when I\u2019m saying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562292\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">THERAPIST: Is that a little like the last dream, where it partly conveys what you don\u2019t know about where I\u2019m coming from and what I\u2019m interested in? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes. And some of that shows up with Jeremy, too. I don\u2019t feel like I know him that well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: Maybe what I\u2019m interested in turned out to be kind of foreign anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Maybe, but I think that\u2019s a stretch. (pause) I would like to know what you majored in in college. I think about asking you like every other session. [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:51) the dream [ ]. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll think about that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: You have blocks and crayons and colors and paintings. I don\u2019t know if you do paintings with children. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve thought about it much, honestly, since we talked about it.  I guess . . . (long pause) You seem to be enjoying this. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m laughing for the simple reason that I\u2019m anticipating that you\u2019re going to say \u201clet me think about it.\u201d  The question is pretty fun, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: I also wonder why you both think about and think about asking me what I studied in college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s like an [extensive] (ph?) thing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually that important to me, but sometimes a thing will lodge into my mind about what I really want to know about you and instead of just asking it the first time, usually I\u2019m worried that you\u2019re going to pay attention to when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">I\u2019m asking it and deflect. And for some questions, I really, really don\u2019t want that. I\u2019d rather not ask than to be [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:03).  So I think that\u2019s one of those questions that pops into my head half the time once, and then it\u2019s like this really isn\u2019t the right time to ask. But I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200432\">I have a bit of a complex about not being answered \u2013 and that\u2019s your fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Sure. And I would imagine it\u2019s like bringing a \u201ckeep out\u201d sign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s what it feels like. I would imagine that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to you that I\u2019m doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It does. It definitely does, but it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re just trying to keep me out and trying to redirect me to something that you think is more important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So I\u2019m being kind of sneaky and deceptive, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly sneaky. You have three ways when I ask you a question. You either answer or you say \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer\u201d or you wonder about why I\u2019m asking when I\u2019m asking what it might say or what it might suggest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: So that\u2019s pretty clear to me. And the third one is not deceptive, it\u2019s like you\u2019re saying \u201cthe striking thing about that to me is this other thing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: The way you put it before, it\u2019s as though I am saying I think this is more important than the piece of information that you want; something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: I see. Yes. Yeah, it does have that feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: I think the psychoanalytic process matters more than your wanting to be close to me and my being close to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562292\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes \u2013 or that\u2019s how I feel when you do that. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s probably one of the big things. I guess it makes me think of Jeremy\u2019s ADHD stuff. That\u2019s my thing that really gets in the way between you and me; and that I, in an analogous way, don\u2019t seem to want to let go of or deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a little more hurtful with you because Jeremy wants to let go of it. He wants me to let go of him. I don\u2019t know how much. I think he\u2019s probably very, very attached to it. But he sees that it causes me pain and he has tried in various ways \u2013 though I don\u2019t think in the right ways or hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">enough.  It\u2019s sort of like this huge, valiant struggle for him. Sometimes it feels like he just can\u2019t do it. He just can\u2019t do it. With you it feels like a decision that maybe you made before meeting me about the way that you\u2019re going to be; or maybe the field made it for you. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s all <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">entangled with the method and history and [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:25) a little bit. It feels like you\u2019ve done all the intersection; you have contemplative practices that bring things up for you, probably every day, and still you\u2019ve decided to stick with the way that feels like it puts the psychoanalytic <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F3\">process [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:07) \u2013 the type of feeling close that I want.  You\u2019re not na\u00efve about it the way that sometimes it feels like Jeremy is. You\u2019re not avoiding it, though maybe you are. I can\u2019t imagine that you have avoided it for more than a year, so at some point you\u2019re not avoiding it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F4\">(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: This issue is on me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s not on you.
