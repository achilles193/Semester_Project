I told Monica [ph?] that this was what I was doing, but I haven\u2019t [inaudible] the kids. My original goal was to make those hats that have the scarves that come down and have little pockets, but that ended up being a lot more time. And they\u2019re actually\u2026 it was fun <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">to figure out how to do it but the knitting itself was really boring. (pause) I tend to be interested in a project about\u2026 until I can figure out what it\u2019s going to look like, and then I\u2019m done, which is not really good. [1:17] (pause) So I spent a lot of time yesterday sort of being very hard on myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">and getting very angry at myself. And (pause) I don\u2019t know, eventually I was like well, yeah, I think I\u2019m just really sad and lonely, and it\u2019s easier to be angry at myself than to be sad. [2:27] (pause) I thought about Dan [ph?] a lot yesterday. (pause) Started rewatching Downton Abbey. It\u2019s just as <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">good as I remember it being. [4:40] I stopped it to tell James a funny part and he laughed, and he was like you also found that funny a year ago when you watched it for the first time, which is not really surprising. (pause) Yeah, I was about as connected yesterday to other people as I generally am. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F4\">I talked with [inaudible] some and I talked to Amanda some, and I sent Jerry [ph?] an e-mail. She is having to have some, I think, painful confrontations with the other members of the company that she\u2019s a member of. I guess she\u2019s basically being shut out. And that\u2019s pretty shitty. [6:55] Yeah, James <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F5\">and I talked. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. James and I ended up having a pretty silly conversation about baby names when we were\u2026 as we were both going to bed and sort of sleepy. I\u2019d read an article about how to name your baby, mostly because it was on Facebook and I was bored. And there is\u2026 apparently there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F6\">a site you can go to where you type in a name and it shows you a chart of the popularity of a name over the last century, which is endlessly amusing. So we sort of talked about that. And my family has four family names that they just name everybody the same names. So there\u2019s nine Wes\u2019s and Jason\u2019s and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F7\">Ulysses\u2019 [ph?] and Oliver\u2019s. [8:21] And James hates all of these names, and I know that, and I was just messing with him. I don\u2019t know, but we had this conversation and, I don\u2019t know (pause) and I\u2019m sort of embarrassed to be talking about this conversation that I had with my husband about what to name <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F8\">our imaginary children when we have them, which why would I be embarrassed about that, but I (pause) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Well one possibility that comes to me is that it was an intimate conversation and the (pause) you have a feeling that that sort of opens you up to my criticism or disinterest. [9:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what it is. (laughter) I mean I am, I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re ever going to have that ever. I feel like I, at some point, used to be\u2026 I mean certainly when we got married, that\u2019s sort of why I married him. I just felt extremely secure with James. I know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">our\u2026 I know what we are together and that\u2019s not going to change. And I know he still loves me and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20012-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562094\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] kind of double [inaudible] for things to get much less secure with him in that\u2026 it sucks in the first place but also undermines something that you quite specifically found really important and reassuring about being with him in the first place. [11:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, it feels like I\u2019m just always anxious with him, a little bit, because I always feel like (pause) yeah, I feel like I have to do some set of things to sort of hold us together or hold him up [inaudible] or that\u2019ll be it; he\u2019ll leave. But that\u2019s really new, or relatively new. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">[13:03] (pause) So then to add to that last night, and he sort of tries to take care of me and I get anxious about that. And yeah, [inaudible] (pause) I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m thinking about moving [ph?] this engagement ring. So I texted Amanda and James\u2019s mom to say we found it. And Amanda I told about it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200172\">and James\u2019s mom, I just assumed he had told about it. But no, no, she was like oh, I\u2019m so glad. And then later he was like did you tell her that you\u2019d lost that? I was like no, I just assumed you did. He said well\u2026 he said I wasn\u2019t sure that it was gone yet. I hadn\u2019t given up yet. [15:07] I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200173\">generally the whole time\u2026 the whole month we were looking at it, 20 days, I was sort of (pause) I both sort of couldn\u2019t believe it was gone and I also couldn\u2019t believe that we would ever get it back at the same time. (pause) Yeah, I guess sort of the same thing with James. I both can\u2019t believe that\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200174\">it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s gone but I feel like the security that I have with him is gone. [16:33] (pause) And I\u2019d get that back and (pause) I don\u2019t know, I sort of feel like I\u2019m talking around something. I can\u2019t really\u2026 I don\u2019t really have much to say about it but I can\u2019t let it go. And so I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200175\">getting frustrated for myself. Part of it is some of the stuff I really wanted to talk to you about last night and it is not\u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel as urgent now, or I don\u2019t quite remember what I wanted to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: Is some of what you feel you\u2019re circling around just how awful it is that that sense of security is gone, or eroded? [18:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like (pause) I\u2019m not sure this is quite it but it sort of feels like because I don\u2019t feel secure in James, I don\u2019t feel secure in anybody. And it\u2019s feeling really lonely. [ph?] (pause) But I don\u2019t know what to say about that. [21:57] (pause) I\u2019m trying to sort of [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">trying to just say that I feel sad and lonely, but I\u2019m not [inaudible] all of the other things I say to myself to distract myself from that. But (pause) And I\u2019m stuck [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Are you\u2026 maybe you\u2019re worried that you\u2019ll have a hard time handling it if you talk and think about how lonely and insecure you\u2019re feeling. [28:53] Maybe a bit while you\u2019re here but maybe especially after we\u2019re done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) It\u2019s sort of a strange thing that I come in here and I talk and when I leave I just sort of have to put everything away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a completely strange thing. I [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m pretty good at that but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily good for me. [29:54] Sort of the opposite happened yesterday in couples counseling. I was pretty sad in the morning and just sort of woke up sad and also anxious about it. And James could tell when we were driving over but he didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">really say anything about it. And then we got there and I was like okay, time to do this now. And I mentioned that I had been sad to Dr. Jannis. [ph?] He was like what? He just can\u2019t tell. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. But it makes continuity hard. It does. (pause) It sort of feels like living out of a suitcase, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">if that makes sense. In some ways. Once you put everything away you don\u2019t want to take it all out again. (pause) I don\u2019t know, I worry that it\u2019s not fair to you to just come and be sad. [32:00] And yeah, then I\u2019ll stop worrying about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562094\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: Maybe rather being preconvinced that it\u2019s not fair to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s burdensome to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, to\u2026 but most of the time, even when I\u2019m by myself, even when James\u2019s left the apartment, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s like I can tell I\u2019m sad somewhere but [inaudible] It\u2019s always like yesterday was better than other days because I could just be sad. (pause) Sorry.

[33:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: No, I guess I just really don\u2019t want to be boring.

We already talked about these things and we dealt with them, and now they\u2019re happening again. And why is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">the\u2026 I just feel like I\u2019ve been circling through the same things over and over.

(pause) And I just keep having (pause) But at the same time, I don\u2019t know, I feel like in some ways if I stopped having to deal with it I wouldn\u2019t recognize <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">myself anymore.
