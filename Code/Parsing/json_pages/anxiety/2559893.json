Maybe you didn't talk about the orchids and then I suggested that you try an easier plant. Also, orchids are so weird, because when they don't have flowers, they're sort of bad-looking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">They're very heady plants.

It reminds me of the groups of five checkmarks that I made-it was like 100.

We had just come back from a week at the beach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">It was kind of like similar, same feelings as what I have sometimes, now, except there's not a purity of pain, now.  There's a lot more dirty pain and on top of the clean pain. But the clean pain was like...\"This hurts so much. How am I going to live until the next time?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559893\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">It's like an ache.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">I must have figured out that counting would bring relief, but I don't know where (inaudible at 00:09:52) it was in the house.

September, October, November; 30, 60, 90; and then half of August and half of December. A hundred and twenty; maybe a hundred and twenty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">Heady Jay. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">There wasn't this dialogue, going, \"Hey! I figured out that counting is something I can do!\" It was just like I was in my own world...with this achy, debilitating...feeling the pain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Jeremy thinks that I loved my parents and my family life so much that I didn't notice the bad things-not that they were there and they were not welcome at home. But, obviously, this pain-there's no space for it. I guess I didn't notice that that was something that could have been there at that-when <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">I was young.  Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">Jeremy's interpretation of...my pain, now, is that he is-a direct quote-he's \"a good margin less lovely\" than my parents. And so I'm noticing a lot of things that their loveliness covered up about the world and myself and him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think so, either. I do think that's a rude awakening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: I mean, you couldn't say something like that unless it's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Hmm. Yeah, you couldn't. Well, it's sort of typical of him. He's pretty self...self-critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: [Isn't he] (ph) self-deprecating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: Self-deprecating, which is paired with a very strong...perfectionism and-I mean, all of it, I think, comes from a very strong fear of fear.  Fear of-who knows? A lot of fear, but sometimes it comes out in a self-deprecating. And often, it comes out in a...\"I'm right, you're wrong.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">He is usually right, if you're playing along with the game that somebody's right and somebody's wrong. Like the way the towel has to be hung best so that it dries. Or the way that the rubber ring inside a pressure cooker has to expand so that it forms the best seal and doesn't make a huge mess. Or the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200911\">way you pour grains from one container to another so that it doesn't make a huge mess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: Or the way you don't-the way you should remember not to put a certain peeler on the end-grain walnut cutting board because it leaves a black-it reacts and leaves a black, chemical residue. These are things that I do often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">It's hard to argue-no, my way of putting the towel back, which is completely...haphazard and thoughtless and the towel isn't going to dry at all this way. Yeah, that's the wrong way, if you want the towel to dry.  Anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">Those are some vignettes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: Three kinds of towels, by the way: kitchen towels; bathroom, hand towel; and bathing towel.

My mom has this theory about her sister, who got married at 18 and whose husband is a VP. She didn't really have a career.

[Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">So there's some truth to it, because it is the engineers who got out of India who came here in the most successful way-in a successful way; as opposed to the population that came here and start businesses. They're good but they're really less well-to-do than the people who came here, got graduate degrees-or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D11\">didn't, but came as quantitative engineer people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">So, yeah, everybody in my family, including all the people who married into the family started off as engineers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">But my mom's theory is that her sister's not having a career has made her...insecure and wanting a lot of control in her life; wanting to control a lot of things about her environment and the people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">I was just thinking about how to apply it to Jeremy's mom and how I could see that happening if it's at all true; maybe it's bullshit. But the theory about how I can see a trajectory for Jeremy that would involve...something like what his mom has experienced, which is dabbling a lot in various different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D71\">things, not working in a conventional career path.

Somehow, no one's door is closed or you-we-this wasn't a house where anyone closed doors; so my parents were in my room a lot. And David Novak's (sp?) fourth-grade picture was on my bulletin board, too. So in some sense, there was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2027F1\">a quiet acknowledgment but never...never really anything deeper. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20281\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20283\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20285\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20287\">THERAPIST: I think it's probably in the moment here, between you and me, important to you to feel like you and I are on the same page about this; and see how they were in a similar way or that, yeah, that we see (inaudible at 01:25:47).
