Go on thinking that. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Every Tuesday feels like Friday now. It's really bizarre. I've got to go into the office today because some crazy woman called me yesterday and after I agreed to help her, she starts hounding me about it and she starts crying and just... (PAUSE) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">Basically her father in law has given them a house to live in. However it's in irrevocable trust with the Brianefit of the daughter. And she's basically worried about all these things that are beyond her control. I can tell without reading this document that she has really... She's fucked. She's worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">about if her husband... Because it just says \"wife\" in the trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh wait. Sorry. Her father gave...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Father in law. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Father in law. To protect the daughter but she's not his daughter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: She's the daughter... Her daughter, the grandchild, is the Brianeficiary of the trust. So ultimately the house goes to the daughter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: The granddaughter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: The granddaughter.

Now I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, you know, she wants to make changes and do all... She's worried that, number one, if she gets divorced, she's got nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Which that was the whole reason it was set up this way. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) She's right about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, and she's upset because she has to take care of the house and she's not going to, you know... And I think to myself, you know, this woman's very selfish. And so you're given a house to live in and you're complaining that you have to keep it up. I mean, are you paying mortgage? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">Are you paying rent? You know? Map it out and go live somewhere else and see what you have to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">You've got to pay rent...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: But, you know, I'll bill her. (PAUSE) But I've got to go to Pembroke (ph) today because she slipped the trust under my door. She couldn't e-mail it or fax it. (inaudible at 00:02:23) So... (PAUSE) So I watched the kids on Sunday morning. We had a little... Ian (ph) had strep throat so he was, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">you know, wound up and just had a lot of energy and they were going to Jess's (ph) parents later in the day. And, you know, Ian was talking, Lucille (ph) taking whatever she was holding and running around her. You know... And as I'm leaving, Jess says to me, she's like, \"You know, you need to...\" She <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">says that my taunting of Ian, which I wouldn't say what I do is taunting, is causing him to taunt Lucille. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(PAUSE) Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Do you need a tissue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: I've already got some. Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I'm sure I've shown you how to make a handkerchief dance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yep. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) Bless you. Bless you. Allergies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: All this (inaudible at 00:03:55) yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Better? (PAUSE) So couldn't it just be that genetically he has my gene for taunting and that no matter what I do he's going to taunt her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Could be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: I mean, I just mess with the kid. You know? He's very smart and he's very... You know, he tries to call me on everything. You know? So I just give it back to him and he... (PAUSE) You know, a lot of the kids I talk to a little sarcastically or whatever, they just kind of give up, ignore me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">and (inaudible) but he wants to win the battle. So... (PAUSE) He's obsessed with this... I do this... \"You want to see the fastest draw in the West? Do you want to see it again? Do you want to see it again?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559698\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) He is dead set, hell Briant on proving that I am not drawing my...

You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I guess to me (PAUSE) the question really is about, you know, what's the feel of it. You know, if it's... And I guess, especially what's the feel of it to him? Is it just fun? This is part of hanging out and he enjoys it (inaudible at 00:05:41) because, you know, there's actually a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">affection and sympathy sometimes in teasing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: He gets frustrated sometimes. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Or does it feel a little to him... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I'll say things to him, you know (inaudible at 00:06:01) I guess. I'll say to him... He's doing something wrong and I'm telling him to stop, I'm like, you know... He kind of just looks at me or keeps doing it, I'll go, \"Fine. Just never, ever use the iPhone again.\" You know? But that's, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">know... That's not really a taunt. I do that to all the kids on the soccer team. I say, you know, \"If you whine and you ask me to go in the game, you're never going to play the rest of the day.\" And if they keep whining, I'm like, \"Okay. Next week you're not coming into the game.\" And then... And I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">telling like all six kids who are crying on the side line they're not ever going to get to go in again. They're believing me. So and like they keep whining, you know, I'm like, \"Okay. That's it. You guys aren't playing the rest of the season.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: You know, there's like one or two kids who believe you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: The rest just ignores you. You know? So I do that kind of stuff to Ian. You know, Jess, she just... She sees a problem and she just has to fix it and she's going to find the... You know, it can't be nature. Nature never causes anything to her. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It's probably likely that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I'm not taking his toy and going, \"Heh, heh, heh, heh.\" You know, I'm not doing that to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Well, he's her older brother so he's going to tease her unquestionably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Of course. Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: You might be contributing to it. I mean, it's not like there's just one reason he's doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: No. But there's no reason to, you know, admonish me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I'm laughing because I get that... I feel like you're doing two things at once. One of them is, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Pull out the \"it's Cameron's (ph) fault.\" Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I'm not even saying you're doing anything wrong yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I think one thing you want is like to do the usual thing you do with Jess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">Like, \"Oh my. She's such an asshole.

You're being overdramatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yes. I'm characaturing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: I think you're just taunting me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Really. You feel taunted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Like who's taunting who now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I don't know. You're just... You're enjoying it too much I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, if I'm making you feel bad, then I want to know about that. But if you're just giving me a hard time, having to avoid thinking about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Well, I guess there's some... It's not something I'm like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Well, the other thing I think you're trying to do... Well, let me just get the second thing I want to say out before we get away from the topic completely. I think you're... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">I think, in part, you want to know if I think you're doing something wrong with Ian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: No. That's not actually accurate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Okay. What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: I want you to say, \"Yeah. You know, you're probably not causing him to pick on his sister.\" That's all I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: It's fine. Just keep doing what you're doing. It's great. Don't even worry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: (SIGH) (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, like I said, the important thing to me would be the feel of it and I do think he'd likely be taunting her whatever was going on between the two of you because (inaudible at 00:09:45) he's her older brother so of course he will. Now, you may be contributing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">the tone of it or... For example, if you were making him feel really helpless and really ashamed, you know, which doesn't sound like you are but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">(CROSSTALK) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: If you were making him feel a certain way and you saw him making her feel exactly that way, whatever it was, you know, then the effect you're having would be important. You know? And you probably wouldn't want to do that to him. But, again, you know, I don't know what the feel of it is between <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">the two of you and I don't know what it is between the two of them. So... (PAUSE) I can't really say. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Well, it's like he doesn't... It's not like he gets frustrated. Maybe there's a little frustration. But he doesn't give up. Like I told him about this statute where parents are allowed to, you know, kick, punch, and poke their kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: And they're not allowed to do that to their parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: And I keep bringing it up and he keeps defending that there's no such law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: So it's not like he's crying or, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, you've got to do the best you can to get a read on what his reaction is and you can also ask him. Like, yeah, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">(CROSSTALK)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: I'm just building character for him. Just character.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Well, if he says he doesn't like it, that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: He's never said he doesn't like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I mean, you could say, \"You know we joke around and it's fun and stuff. Does it ever really actually start to feel bad too? You know, most of the time I think it's fun but sometimes I kind of wonder or worry that it actually kind of makes you feel bad. Does it?\" You could say something like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB1\">that. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">I think he would probably tell you. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I guess this is a good example which I don't find to be taunting. He had strep throat, went home from school. So there was soccer practice at five. The next day he was going to go with me to a handball tournament (inaudible at 00:12:27) And I kind of forgot that he had strep on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF1\">way to soccer practice. So I'm like going to pick him up and I call Jess to tell her that I was running late. And she's like, \"He's not going to soccer practice.\" And I'm like, \"Oh yeah. Oh yeah.\" But she's like, \"Hold on. He wants to talk to you.\" I'm like, \"Hey buddy. How are you doing?\" He's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF2\">\"Fine.\" You know, it's like, \"You know, Dad.

Doesn't know what to think. He's like, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C72\">know, wants to look out the window at the driveway.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: He was fine. If anything, he was probably, you know, upset maybe that she was laughing at him.

No more 9:20 games on Monday night like last night.

I mean, obviously you can drink too much before a game. I go to the tournament on Saturday. I would have a beer every game. You know, drink a beer... I thought that helped with, you know, just my muscles and staying loose and keeping me happy. I mean, I'm not going to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F1\">drunk drinking four beers over the course of an entire afternoon. You know? It's when you go to the bar afterwards that you're drinking in succession. That's when, you know... (PAUSE) Assuming you don't eat any food. (PAUSE) (SIGH) (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">(PAUSE) Other than that, I'm okay. I was just grasping at the whole Jess being a bitch thing. I've got to complain about something. I can't complain to her. I really can't complain to anybody about it. I don't want to complain to Marcia about anything family related. She's still... Like I mentioned <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201211\">separation agreement and she was like, \"I thought you were getting a divorce.\" You know? It's like that's what it's called in a divorce. It's a separation agreement. So I can tell she's still a little...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Wary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: So I don't want anything to follow that.

I think it was like 125 bucks. Flowers are like $35 apiece. I don't know what happened. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: They fuck you at the drive through. And they don't even deliver them. They deliver them through FedEx. They don't even deliver them with flower people anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Oh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) It's ProFlowers. They send them a box of flowers and a vase and they've got to put them all together. I did it once for Jess and she got all pissed off. You know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: Because they delivered the flowers separate from the vase? Was she upset...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just gave her the box instead of taking it out and putting the flowers in the vase myself and... (PAUSE) So I was complaining that, you know, she didn't like gifts. She doesn't like when people give her gifts. But you didn't give her a gift. You gave her a bad gift. You know? This is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201371\">the (inaudible at 00:23:37) (PAUSE) Never got me flowers ever. (PAUSE) Yeah. Marcia is having a birthday in two weeks. Twenty ninth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">I feel like I have to do something but, you know... (PAUSE) Dinner, flowers, or something. You know, like a nice dinner. You know, like Taco Bell. (PAUSE) (SIGH) (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">(PAUSE) It feels like Friday. I don't know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Huh. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: The same thing happened last week. Tuesday felt like Friday. I kept thinking it was Friday. I kept thinking, \"Oh, what do I have to do this weekend?\" (PAUSE) I mean, once I played with the kids I just basically went home and slept. It's pretty exhausting. And I think I slept too much because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F1\">I had trouble getting up yesterday and I had plenty of sleep, you know, because I took a nap. I went to bed early. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">(PAUSE) I think I'd really be in trouble if I wasn't working out. I think that's the only thing that's helping me keep in pace. (PAUSE) Because just running and handball a couple of nights a week isn't enough to get you in shape for handball. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: I see. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: You've got to be doing something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: Well, it's good. A lot of the stuff you're doing is stuff you like to do.

I have handball Tuesday and Thursday. And it's going to be like six people there. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: Thirteen... And then, you know, I want Ian to sleep over and, you know... Kitty (ph) was like, \"Oh, you're not going to practice?\" (inaudible at 00:27:41) (PAUSE) She's like, \"What are you doing?\" The first thing she says, \"You going on a date?\" I was like, \"No, no.\" (PAUSE) What does she expect <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F1\">from me? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">It's practice. I would have blown off the 9:20 game if I could have. You know? (PAUSE) I just told her she was a mean bitch. It's kind of true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: She can be a little mean.

You know, I sent a picture to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">THERAPIST: I thought she met Marcia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: Didn't Marcia go to her birthday party?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: No. She didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: This was when...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: She was going to go.

We got sent into the middle bracket playing for fifth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">So we ended up winning our next two games and we win fifth place but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: The four winners of the pools play for first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: So by losing that one point, the universe point...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">CLIENT: Had we won that we could have played for first. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">THERAPIST: And how many teams were in each bracket?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">CLIENT: Actually, come to think of it, there were three pools with four teams... No. Four pools with three teams. No. Four pools, three pools with four teams. So they must have taken the top three and then the best of the second place teams as far as, either point differential or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:31:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: What's that? Well, because they took the four teams up for the number one bracket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: So they took three winners and then the next best because they needed to play two on two, two. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: We were in that middle bracket. Instead of playing for ninth, we were playing for fifth. So... But it was fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: I kind of prefer those tournaments where, you know, you can goof around, make bad throws and, you know, it's like at the end of the game... They do this every so often. You play a senior one where all the old players get on the team. But one, Curtis (ph), had to go deal with his kids. So I've <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A31\">got the handball during the, at the end zone. Everybody's just kind of moving towards me and it's this blob. And I'm like, \"I'm throwing a hammer. Go, go.\" (LAUGHTER) It was ugly.

(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">I don't feel like I had to ride my bike out (ph) last night because I didn't want to work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">CLIENT: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:34:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So between the running and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And the leg workouts... Burpees in there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: No burpees. I do squats and pushups, leg raises and pushups.

Because he's doing it with the team like ten or fifteen bucks but it's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It works out better when you do it by yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, like it was cancelled. We didn't have a game so there was no workout. So like I just feel like, you know, the extra attention and the extra motivation, I can kind of... If I need to take a break...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559698\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">CLIENT: ...the whole system stops instead of everybody moving on and me, you know...

He was saying that they told her that... You know, because she had talked about starting her own business that they were kind of like phasing her out and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20207\">THERAPIST: Why did they fire her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">CLIENT: Things had happened a while ago, you know, that she screwed up and she admits screwing up. Like she wasn't (inaudible at 00:37:45) (LAUGHTER) Whoops. And so I think there's some confusion of her saying, \"Oh, I'm going to get another job,\" and so they felt like they should, were looking for it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202091\">or... I don't know. They were using... They were telling her that this, you know, they didn't want to wait for it to happen again, you know, where she was like doing better and not screwing up anymore. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020B\">And so, I think she was just... The whole way it happened too, you know... It's not like, \"Okay...\" You know, you're friends so you think like, \"We're going to let you go but we're going to give you a little bit of time to find another job or, you know, two weeks' severance,\" or something. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020F\">CLIENT: But it happened very confrontationally and... And he's an awkward person. And... (PAUSE) Whatever. (PAUSE) In time, you know, it'll... Marcia was never really friends with Kerry (ph) to begin with. She was friends with Mosby. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20211\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20213\">CLIENT: Like her really good friend from growing up is like really good friends with Mosby. This guy Carlton (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20215\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">CLIENT: He's a lunatic.

(PAUSE) I think they're all crazy. Mosby's from Fairfield (ph). He's definitely crazy on many levels. (PAUSE) Did you watch the hockey last night? I watched it while they were sucking and then played handball.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D\">THERAPIST: Did they win? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021F\">CLIENT: They scored two goals in the last 82 seconds to tie it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20221\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20223\">CLIENT: And they won in overtime, game seven.
