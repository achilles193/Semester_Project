(Pause) This looks vacuumed (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the carpet was shampooed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Oh, nice. How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Good, thank you.

[0:00:57] (Pause) Do you remember or (chuckling)...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Is it that important to start there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just... not important but might lend continuity. (Sighing) I cannot remember. (Pause) [0:02:00] Yeah, I guess I'm kind of in a... I don't know, clearer space (chuckling)? So I feel a little lost I suppose. I was in Ohio this weekend, so I've kind of lost touch with last week (chuckling). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">So... (Pause) Yeah. I'm desperately thinking about that friend (ph) from last week (chuckling). [0:03:01] (Pause) Oh, yeah, I guess we were speaking... one thing we were talking about was when I think of Victor (sp?), right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay. It took a while to remember (chuckling). Hmm. Yeah. (Sighing) Yeah, I went to see Graham (sp?) this weekend (chuckling). So it's very different from everything else (chuckling). [0:03:58] (Pause) [I'll tell you what I] (ph) told my mom, and yeah. I don't think I can share this with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">everyone. [Oh, no] (ph), I told my friend in Ohio (chuckling), so it's like... I just wonder how I'm coming across now. Just a little curious. Yes. (Pause) You're not curious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: About how you're coming across?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, about just the weekend and visiting (chuckling). [0:05:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Am I supposed to ask you about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see. Versus your telling me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What does it mean that I would ask? What...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: That you'd be curious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: And if I don't say anything then I'm not curious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Then I wouldn't know (chuckling). I would assume you're curious, so... (Pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm always curious, so it would imply that I'm more curious about that than other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: And I should be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, I mean, if you're not then you're not. What are you curious about (chuckling)? [0:05:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Well, if I were curious about that I'd be like, ooooo (sp?), what happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'd like that (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah? What would you like about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: I don't know. It would make it friendlier (chuckling), so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Because it's not friendly now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was just, like, oh, no, (inaudible at 0:06:24) silence, and I'm just going to start talking or yapping. So (chuckling)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well, what does my silence feel like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: No, I mean it doesn't... I mean, I know that's the procedure, but I guess I feel like, it'd be great if you said, oh, tell me about this, tell me about that (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: The procedure sounds like a surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Okay, sure. [0:06:58] I just meant the way that you do things officially, structured and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Hmm. It feels very... it feels structured?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Huh. And if I said, oooo, tell me about this, tell me about that, it would be less structured?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it would be warmer (chuckling). So that's all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: But I had this thing happen to me on Friday, but I didn't want to talk about it. I guess it wasn't even in my mind to talk about because I was feeling kind of light, like I guess (inaudible at 0:07:41), kind of silly even, until now (chuckling). And then as I was going through it, I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F1\">I guess I'll talk to you about it. [0:07:54] But I was going to Ohio, and I was late on the subway? Was just... kind of got held up for, like, half an hour, a little less than that. But I missed my 2:00 bus to Ohio. And this man there... I've described the scenario to everyone now (laughing) over e-mail, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F2\">but this man was acting very paternalistic. And he was Nepalese, so he's the conductor who kind of takes care of the bus. So he said to me in Nepali, the 2:00 bus is gone. The next one is 2:30, and I can see if I... I'll see if I can get you on there. He was just announcing it to a bunch of people who <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F3\">had come, just kind of me included? And he just kind of... then he just turned to me, move aside, and he just kind of touched my shoulder, and just kind of directed me to stand aside.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559550\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">So, I mean, I was pissed by the subway, and I was pissed that I was late and I'd missed the bus. And I was... I just immediately became aware of his paternalistic sense? [0:08:59] I mean, I didn't mind that he talked to me in Nepali. I thought, it's good, the Chinese talk to each other in Chinese. It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">good for diversity's sake and all that. Just... these are just your... these impressions come to you in, like, a millionth of a second and all that. But... so he touched me, and he pushed a little... pushed me aside a little bit. And I just kind of said, don't touch me, and I just kind of moved away. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">I just kind of said it to myself when I moved away. But I didn't want him to hear it, or I didn't want him to see that I was irritated because I thought I should have more control over my irritability. But as I was turning away he said, what did you say? What did you say? I said, nothing, don't worry <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200613\">about it. And I just kept walking, and I sat down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">And then a few minutes later, more people came and... who had missed the 2:00 PM bus, and the guy, he started writing his... their names down on a piece of paper. [0:10:01] And I was like, well, what's going on? He's writing everyone's name down, so I went up to him and said, write my name down, too, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">please. So he was like, don't talk to me. You were very rude to me earlier. You said something very rude to me. I'm not going to help you. And I was like, wait, I didn't say anything rude, and he was like, no, you did. I heard you, very sternly. And I just, fuck. What the fuck has happened? I just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200632\">and all these weird emotions just started pumping through me (chuckling). And I just lost it, and I just started shouting at him. I was like, what the fuck is this? You can't treat me like this. I mean, when a woman says don't touch me, that's not supposed to be rude. What the hell are you doing? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200633\">like... and I just stormed away. And then I realized the stupid bus didn't have a counter there at the station. And I took [the bus] (ph), and they don't have a counter there. So I was like, what the fuck am I going to do? [0:10:56] So I started crying, and then I just went back and stood in line again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">And then the 2:30 bus comes up, and he's seating people. And this stupid guy... I started talking to him. I was like, what is he doing? And he was just like, you stupid bitch. Go away, don't talk to me, you look mad or whatever. And then I just hated the blank expression on that guy's face. And this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">guy, the conductor, started seating, and he said, come on, come on, let's go. And I was like, wait, let me get on. He was like, no, I am in charge of this bus, and you are not getting on this bus. You're not getting on the next bus, and you're getting on the bus today or ever. It's my say, it's my company. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200652\">I'm not going to let you get on... I just felt like, what the hell? I felt so reprimanded like a little girl, like my dad as punishing me or something. I just was crying, and this other guy came round. He was like, don't let him do this to you [any more] (ph). [0:12:02] You have a ticket. Go fight for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200653\">it. Go speak to someone. Go speak to security. Go do this, go do that. And he was supporting me. And I was just crying, I was like, no, I can't do anything. There's not a counter, and this and that. And I was calling them on the phone also, but they were just not hearing me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559550\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">And so I go and find security, these two big, bulky guys. And he's like, what? What are you saying? What is going on? And I was explaining to him the scenario, and he was like, ma'am, calm down. We deal with this every day. And he's going to tell me... I'm going to go up and talk to him, but I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">want you to know this is your side of the story. And he's going to tell me his side of the story, so this and that. And he doesn't have to serve you. When you walk into the store, they don't have to serve you. I was like, but my money is just as good as someone else's money. Why is this other guy being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">seated before me? Just because he didn't tell the guy don't touch me? [0:12:59] I mean, what the hell? So he was going and talking to him, the security guy. And they started talking, and this guy started telling him stories, like, oh, yeah, she cursed my wife, she cursed my daughters, this and that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200673\">And I was like, wait a second. Fuck both of you guys. I didn't say... but that's what I was thinking. I was like, this is a completely deranged system. You guys can say whatever you want. I'm backing out. I'm going and buying a ticket with another bus company. And that's what I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">But I couldn't stop crying from 2:00 to, like, 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM, until almost the time I got to Ohio. I just felt so horrible, like, absolutely shaken up (laughing). And the moment he said, I'm not helping you, and he was in this position of authority and talking down to me and being so paternalistic, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">and me being helpless and not being able to do anything, I just felt so cornered. [0:14:05] And I just felt horrible (chuckling). Completely powerless. And I was just like, why am I feeling anything? Why are they like this? Why can't I be calm? Why can't I be rational? Why did I say, don't touch me? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">I regretted saying that, and then I regretted shouting. And then I regretted just not walking away and buying a new ticket and forgetting about it. I was so traumatized. Coming back, I thought, maybe I shouldn't come back by bus (ph). Maybe I should come back by another bus. I was like, no, but I bought <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200693\">the ticket. And I was thinking, what if he's in Ohio? What if he stops me? What if this, what if that? Just completely got so scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559550\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">But I told everyone about it. I was like, I need community. [0:14:56] Please send me hugs (laughing). So... and they did, and all the guys were so sweet (chuckling). So... but I was just like, man, am I a basket case? Why am I having... throwing tantrums in public? But I'm like, why is this a tantrum? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">If I am irritated and it comes across, then this is what happens. But why am I irritated (chuckling)? Why don't I know how to calm down? (Pause) I guess part of me felt like, I shouldn't be going to Ohio. I'm being punished for going to Ohio (chuckling). [0:15:56] (Pause) (Sighing) I really felt small <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B2\">and infantilized and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Well, he had the power of keeping you off the bus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Why did it make me feel so horrible? Why wasn't it just like, oh, okay, I missed my bus. All right. I'll go get a new ticket. Why wasn't it plain and smooth and unemotional? Why couldn't I just tell myself, oh, I think they do it this way, that if you don't make it to the 2:00 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">PM bus then you have to buy a ticket for the next one? I could have told myself that. Instead, it just became this horrifying thing where everyone else was getting on, and I was not. [0:17:01] It's that thing. It's that feeling of unimaginable or unbearable loss. And this is one fucking seat on a bus <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">(laughing). And it was so intense. Like, this is it, I missed my chance. (Laughing) I don't know why I feel that way, but that's exactly what I felt, completely irreparable, unbearable (chuckling). Yeah. (Pause) Yeah. Kind of like what it felt like when... I mean, that was just a flash, and this was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F3\">more intense, which is weird because that should be more intense, but seeing someone else sitting next to Victor. [0:18:03] I think... yeah, I think those are comparable. [They're weird] (ph), I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Comparable in terms of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Just that feeling that, this is it. I missed it. I messed up, and that's it. It's been taken away from me (chuckling). It's being given to more deserving people who behave, who don't yell and scream and throw tantrums and are not sexually repressed or, you know (chuckling). Not on the bus, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">you know (chuckling). It's like the list of things that I lack, so... (Chuckling) (Pause) [0:18:58] I think that list is building up, so I'm just like, ahhhh (sp?)!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: It's building?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). This weekend I realized Graham's changed. He's (ph) turning into his mom (chuckling). Not that I've met his mom, but he talks about his mom, how she was narcissistic and very judgmental, very critical. So he's very critical. It was very hard to be with him. But there were light, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">good moments. And I guess I'm trying to focus on those, and I'm thinking, maybe I'm like that.

Are you (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, to a large degree, power is a perception, not entirely, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: It is. [0:20:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Political power, maybe not. People actually have an impact on your... how you live. But power is also perception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: It is very much so. It is completely. I mean, Victor has power in my perception, and it's just perception. I mean, I'm saying not just my perception. I'm sure a lot of people might perceive him to be... to have power. But it is what he puts out, like that guy, that fucking bus conductor (chuckling), <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">I'm sorry. He... I completely saw him as a petty lord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

Hmm. Yeah. (Sighing) But yeah, I perceive... I misperceive or something sometimes. And I hate that. I hate it when I see that some people have more power over me, and, when I feel crushed, I absolutely hate that feeling. I think all this happened because as soon as he touched me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">and pushed me and the blah, blah, blah, whatever he said... and all he said was, the 2:00 PM bus has left, and I'll see if I can put you on the 2:30. [0:22:59] But just the tone and the body language and this and that, everything just added up. And the equation became, man bearing down on me and me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B32\">being... me trying to rebel and revolt in a persnickety, kind of irritated manner, reactionary manner. But, if I hadn't perceived him to be almighty and powerful, it would have been all right (chuckling). Why did I feel like, oh, my $21, and I bought it. And please, can it be good enough with the rest? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B33\">Can I get in (chuckling)? So I hate that I see it that way. I wish I could change that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:23:59] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: I think I... this is a big piece for me, because then I will be so much more productive in a lot of relationships? Like, when I'm interacting with professors or people who are above me, and I already just think of them as above me. But I get nervous, and I keep laughing nervously and all that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">And instead of doing that I would be more calm and learn from them instead of just feeling oppressed and wanting to rebel. And with Chris (sp?) also I guess. I would feel like I would appreciate him more and learn from him more instead of just wanting to rebel half the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Was visiting Graham an act of rebellion?

But there was no reason to revolt or rebel, so... I mean, I know he would... he didn't want me to go visit Graham <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">obviously (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Did he know you were visiting him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Kind of, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: What does kind of mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Well, I kind of tried to lie, and then I kind of didn't want to lie?

[0:27:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: What were you hoping for from your visit with Graham?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Well, he is very different.

But I just wanted to be with someone different for... yeah, in Brooklyn and go to clubs or bars and go out to dinner and talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">about completely different things, completely not about the politics in Nepal, and talk about fashion and talk about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">(Phone buzzing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: What does she not get?

I mean, right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: So a better solution is to go find other guys while you're with Chris?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: No, it's not. I know, I mean, I didn't want to talk about this (chuckling). That's why, because I knew you'd be like, what are you doing (laughing)? But I don't know, it's beautiful outside. I did not want to be in D.C. for yet another weekend. It's been a year since I've gone out of D.C.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah, [it seems like]...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Excuses?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Well, not only that... well, not necessarily that, but it turns into your justifying your behavior to me (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559550\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I guess I'm just saying that I had very mixed feelings about going. And it turned out to be a very mixed kind of an experience because of that, because I was preoccupied, because I felt guilty, because I felt like I shouldn't be doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">this. But I wanted to see... I wanted to actually see what it was. I wanted to explore that for various complicated reasons, I mean, knowing full well the consequence of doing it. And the consequences could be that I have to live with my mom now, or I have to find a place of my own right away, cancel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B2\">my tickets to Nepal, and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: How would that... why would that be a consequence? [0:30:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Well, if Chris suddenly behaves like every other man and says, oh, you went to visit Graham. That's it, you are out of here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: But you know Chris hasn't done that in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that's not... I'm saying, I don't want to take that for granted or be like, oh, he's not going to care. Or one time he even said... or a few times he said, oh, yeah, you're an artist. You should explore all these crazy things, crazy behavior (chuckling). And I'm not listening to any <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">of that, and I'm trying to treat him as just another guy who would feel bad, who would feel hurt if he knew and then would ask me to move out and I would have to. And... yeah. I mean, I just have... I have all these questions. Like, how does it work with others? How am I... how can I handle myself with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201132\">other people? [0:32:03] Who are my friends? What do I want? And... in a non-D.C., talk-about-politics-all-the-time kind of scenario? (Chuckling) (Pause) And Chris and I don't do that. Chris and I don't go out to bars or clubs or to... he doesn't just buy tickets to a place and say, let's go. He doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201133\">say, we're going to do this, this, this, and this today. We're going to... yeah (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Do you think that you want him to feel the way you feel with Victor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: Like, oh, there's someone better, sexier, more interesting out there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: I don't understand. I don't think I heard all of it. [0:33:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: That you want to do with Chris what you feel Victor does with you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: That his... he goes with someone who is more interesting, exciting, whatever?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: She ain't (ph) as exciting as me, let me tell you (laughing).

But it's jealousy talking, I guess. Oops (laughing). Yeah, maybe I do. But I don't... I really do treasure that he's kind and likes me and is affectionate. [0:33:59] But once I feel loved and affectionate (laughing), whatever the adjective <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B1\">is, I feel also a little cloistered and coddled. And then I just want to kind of push it aside and spread my wings a little. (Sighing) So it's a dilemma (chuckling). It's a (inaudible at 0:34:33) (chuckling). (Pause) I mean, sometimes I do think that if Chris completely changed I might not look at any <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B2\">other guy ever again. Yeah. [0:35:01] What if he suddenly started doing things that Victor did? Or just any other guy, Graham, that he said, we're going to do this, we're going to go here, we're going to have the best time. And he is completely all up in my face and completely rearranges or disorganizes <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B3\">my day, my expectations, and all of a sudden it's like a volcano of emotions (chuckling).

I think I crave that, so (chuckling)... and I have wondered, what if I had girlfriends who were crazy like that and... or guy friends, but it doesn't come to anything else. [0:35:57] And then I can go back and be with Chris. Maybe, that is, if that would work. I can do all my <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">craziness, crazy things with everyone, with my friends, and then come back home to Chris who has cooked me a meal and (chuckling) is working on a paper and we go to bed at a decent hour. So... but I feel like at the heart of it, at the center of it, what's at stake is my craft?

[0:36:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: I'm talking about how you're feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) But he said, okay go, but don't come back and tell me about it, and don't start going on about how whatever guy is treating you badly. I don't want to hear that (chuckling). (Pause) I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have gone (chuckling). That's why I think I created that scene maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">(laughing), just punish myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: Did you feel... you feel conflicted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't get ready until the last minute. I was working until the last minute, and I rushed. And... yeah. (Pause) [0:38:00] So you said that, and are you anticipating me feeling horrible about it later, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Well, you feel bad about it now (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: But I'm so perky right now, today (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: You've already felt bad about it is what I'm saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: When? At the station?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like... well, you're saying that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) When it didn't work, the intimacy just didn't work, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: We couldn't do it (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's technical (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: I don't know what you're talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">CLIENT: I don't know if I can get into it. Do I have time (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: We have six or so minutes, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: Well, like I said, he's very critical. [0:38:58] So the whole time he kept badgering along (ph) along the whole time. And that gets to me. (Pause) Sex is very difficult. It's been just a few months since I had [sex at all] (ph), whatever, intercourse. So I don't know how it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: What do you mean he was badgering you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: Oh, Graham...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah, how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: Well, so the moment I got there, my train... my bus reached at 7:15, and I was texting him constantly, I'm coming... (inaudible at 0:39:36). And he's like, okay, I'll be there. And then I got there, and I'm like, here. And then five minutes later he's like, I'm visiting a friend. I'll be there <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201671\">in ten minutes. I said... and I had a deadline, I wanted to send my work to my professor. So I'm like, oooo, if I can just find a coffee shop and send it... so I'm walking up, and he's like... oh, yeah, and it was, like, 15 minutes later he texts and says, where are you? [0:40:02] And I said, oh, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201672\">I walked away, and I'll come back. And he just got so pissed. He's like, you're so annoying. And I... that had happened last time, and I really didn't want that to happen. So the whole weekend I was just pussyfooting around him, being a yes man to every single thing he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20166-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20166-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559550\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">And he had printed a photograph on canvas paper, and he put it up on the stairwell. And I was looking at it, and I [touched it a little] (ph), and he's like, why do you touch that? Don't you know...? Haven't you been told not to touch art in museums? And like, sorry. And now I'm thinking, it's not a <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201691\">museum. Come on, relax. And he's completely not changed since ten years ago. We had a huge fight over me just marking up his book, and he was so pissed by that. So that just completely added up. And, when we were trying to be intimate, I didn't want to be intimate. I didn't like him at all. [0:41:01] <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201692\">And that got in the way. So... and he's like, yeah, I want to sleep with you. And I'm like, well, [I'm really] not turned on (chuckling). So... and actually I would have preferred that we would just be friends, and we would hang out and... kind of like how we used to be several years ago, where he would <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201693\">take me to places and buy dinner and this and that. And we'd have a great time talking, but we wouldn't be intimate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">But, since last year that one time we were intimate, it was very good. Like, it was my first sexual experience... well, we didn't have sex, but whatever. It was good for me, the best I'd ever had (chuckling). And... but this time I was dreading it. [0:41:56] I was like, I'm kind of with Chris, even <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B1\">though officially I tell people I'm not. But I am living with him, and we do get intimate, so... and he would e hurt if I did this, so that whole thing also added up. And I just was not turned on (chuckling), and it didn't work. And that whole money thing, he... so I wore these sandals, and he was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B2\">you look like a tunnel and bridge girl. You look like a Pittsburgh girl (chuckling). And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: A tunnel and bridge?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he was like, you're just coming in from Pittsburgh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: Is that what they call people...? Tunnel and bridge or tunnel...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah, bridge... something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: Sounds so derogatory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah, totally. And my... I took... I didn't... like I said, I was in a rush. I didn't pack properly. I packed two bras. One was kind of like push-up. And I've just been wearing push-up bras since last year I thought that was cool, like, it was okay. [0:42:58] And the other bra had red straps, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201771\">so he's like, you look like a streetwalker (laughing). And I told my friend. She's like, what? I've never heard a guy say derogatory things about a girl's underwear (laughing). So that's what I mean. He's completely insane (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">And the whole time, he's like, I want to put you in a summer dress. So why don't we go to Anthropologie and you pay half and I'll pay half? I'm like, but that's still... half of $300 is $150 (laughing). And he's like, so you must be on a shoestring budget because you're a grad student again. He knows <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201791\">all this, but he's controlling, and so that whole weekend was kind of bad. Well, we did still do stuff. We went to the Botanical Gardens, we went to clubs and this and that. And that to me is still five times more than what Chris and I do, which is nothing (chuckling). [0:44:04] So... I'm not saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201792\">that I'd settle for being pushed around and being bullied and being spoken to in a derogatory way, just to have fun. But obviously I'd like (inaudible at 0:44:22), but (inaudible at 0:44:28) is pretty boring (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20178-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20178-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559550\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">CLIENT: Would you rather not be touched at all, or would you rather be touched and maybe once or twice you get a slap?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Are those my only two options?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">CLIENT: I don't think of that (chuckling).

(Pause) (Sighing, chuckling) Yeah, I spoke to a couple of women last night. I guess we can talk about it tomorrow morning (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">THERAPIST: We are going to need to stop in a moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Do you want to come in on Friday?

I just looked at my schedule. I could meet at 11:10 or 11:15.
