Good afternoon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: How are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m doing all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Remember when I stopped with you in December? I was very, very upset. I think I was feeling very rejected by your insurance decision. I don\u2019t think I was actively, I don\u2019t think I knew about feeling upset apart from that but I remember feeling really utterly rejected by your decision and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">because it made me feel vulnerable and insufficient. . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">It also made me feel badly about what I thought might be motivating you in your decision. And I brought it up once I remembered. I remember being aware that I didn\u2019t like it. And you said, after we talked about it I don\u2019t think we really talked about it. I think I said that I was upset by your decision <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">or I didn\u2019t like it because it wasn\u2019t [inaudible at 00:04:02] people. I\u2019m going to try to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So I didn\u2019t have the extent of what I said to you about it and you said you had, I guess we had a conflict of opinion or a conflict of interest. Maybe not directly to that but at the end of that question and then I remember feeling like stomping my little feet. And then that was it. I don\u2019t remember, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">I don\u2019t think there was much processing or coming to the surface of anything else. But I remembered that day today and that there was probably a lot more in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I can imagine what you thought was difficult is feeling like I had made a decision that seemed to be for reasons different from I imagine your sort of thing and mine. This reflected a difference between us; you would not have decided against the people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I wouldn\u2019t. I would want to see poor people. I got really bored seeing only people who prepay out of pocket. But that\u2019s not the case with you. I know that you see plenty of people who don\u2019t have insurance. But it actually turns out I had no fucking clue. I\u2019m not in your shoes. And if I ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">have a practice maybe I\u2019ll feel completely differently. But yes, as an instinctual thing it feels bad in my gut so something would have to evolve which might be my own family, being about my people instead of wanting to be all the people. But yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But I think even now as you\u2019re talking you\u2019re sort of maybe reducing or sort of dismissing the possible differences. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong in what you\u2019re saying I mean I understand that maybe you\u2019re right. But I guess I wonder if there\u2019s some of it motivated by it\u2019s important to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">like actually if we were looking, if we were in the same situation we would be doing it the same way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes I think that feels pretty important. [Pause] Maybe it feels important because I don\u2019t know much about it. If I actually knew some concrete things about your decisions and not actually you did explain it to me. It\u2019s not like I feel in the dark about it. But stuff that you\u2019re not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">to explain to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Do you remember roughly what I explained?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: You said, well I don\u2019t know because I think some of it was influenced by your feeling guilty. But you said that the paperwork was really bad for the other, for the insurance that you were not going to take anymore. But now it occurs to me that you stopped taking all insurance. Is that true? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562288\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Essentially yes. Although at that point that just meant going off the insurance and [inaudible at 00:10:33] anything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I see. Have you been taking other insurance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Not in a bunch of years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: So, yes, so the paperwork was annoying; it took a lot of time. There is something. There\u2019s something. You\u2019re nervous or amused or kind of a combination of something. Paperwork, other people that you\u2019re training who are at your level aren\u2019t taking insurance anymore and they\u2019re charging $200 more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I guess those are the reasons I remember. And I guess you get more money this way. I think I feel really uncomfortable assuming what I would do too. I think the difference is hard, if we were in the exact same place the difference is very hard for me. But it also feels really icky too. Clearly I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">made that leap but I\u2019m not pretending that I haven\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: But at the same time you feel very uncomfortable about it, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes. I see myself doing it and say whoa it\u2019s dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yes I sort of imagine to you it would feel like questioning a parenting decision I might make or something, or somebody else might make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: No, there\u2019s a compassion in my view. My grandmother is called the Mother Theresa of Kentucky, by that community, and her mother was that figure in all the ways that at least in the way that her mom and my mom talk about it. There\u2019s a shrine with a real life-sized statue of her at the little <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">temple that she built and her devotees still visit it twice a day. I mean she was their guru. And I think it\u2019s about 50 people now who come but when she was alive it seemed like she had this incredible spiritual gift that she gave to people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">My mom said that her strongest memory of her is she\u2019s sitting cross-legged in the middle of a room meditating. It\u2019s this multi-family house; I\u2019ve been to it. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s all these levels and there\u2019s, at that time there were my grandmother, her children, her five brothers, their children, the parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">and then various people\u2019s people who needed help. So five families, there were five families. So she, the memory was she was sitting on the ground and there\u2019s eleven kids running around my mom\u2019s memory. She\u2019s just sort of quietly meditating through it all and smiling; very, very peaceful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">So to judge you for your decision feels like it\u2019s leaving some important part out that I want to cultivate or that is important to my mom or is important to me. I want to have compassion for you and your family and what you need. But when I\u2019m being directly negatively affected by it that\u2019s sort of faraway <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">over there and the judging feels much closer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">Then well my grandmother and my great grandmother would still be taking everybody\u2019s damn insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:16:36] another context. Clearly what I wanted to [part of] (ph) the upper middle way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: That\u2019s funny. Yes, there\u2019s very little middle way-ness in Waltham but as a practitioner from what I see there\u2019s a lot of upper middle way. [Pause] Some other stuff I wonder like maybe everybody else\u2019s problems are the same. It doesn\u2019t matter who you see, it\u2019s still just as authoritative. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">maybe it doesn\u2019t matter what class you see or maybe if you took everybody\u2019s insurance it would not change anything about the location or the composition because the ones you want to stay can get the screen and then they\u2019d stay. And the ones you want to go are gone. Can you help me out? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562288\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: [Pause] I guess in a way you want sort of my help making myself back into a good guy somehow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: If that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to say about it. But I guess I want to know if those three things, those three reasons that I basically remember are right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yes that sounds right. I don\u2019t mean to be fuzzy about something that I already said but I happened to not be able to remember. But you remembered, yes, that sounds probably like what I would\u2019ve said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well I guess I want to know, I\u2019m more curious than anything and I also do want to turn you back into a good guy, that\u2019s true. I\u2019m curious about whether it has changed your patient composition or if, and it doesn\u2019t need to be answered in the case you are in, but if you think what classifications <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">you see makes a difference to half fulfilling your record. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: I guess as I try to think about it more closely this is a little bit desealed (ph) to me as bus driving. And if you\u2019re a little bit trying to have me answer to you about my decision about the insurance because which I think it\u2019s probably almost like sort of pulling yourself together or maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">turning the tables a bit from your not having had an iota of say or even all that much of an explanation really about something I did to you among other people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yes it feels very bus drivy. It didn\u2019t at the beginning; it did five minutes ago. It\u2019s sort of hard to control or hard to stop myself. Not that you\u2019re asking me to stop but I guess the feeling -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Right, it kind of happens pretty simply. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yes. It feels like, it does feel like something that I wish something about that I could know it when it\u2019s happening and then I could stop it and then I could not do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard. I think it\u2019s partly a response to really feeling quite vulnerable and powerless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I think I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It kind of sticks to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: I think I also picked up some vulnerability in you and for some reason that made me want to go on the offensive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m smiling because one thought is either it made you uncomfortable or maybe it would work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I think both. I think it makes me uncomfortable that you\u2019re not sometimes I picture a stoic sort of gray old man in your place who doesn\u2019t give me any pique (ph). For the record I wouldn\u2019t be here if that were the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Right, good. [] (ph) where I\u2019m concerned, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. So it doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not that person because it wouldn\u2019t work I think. But sometimes I feel like that would be more instead of are you leading me adrift, are you next to me, are you angering me, like that. Those questions that would be really clear like you\u2019re leading me <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">or you are not affected by me at all. And I don\u2019t get those cues that you are not affected. Like just a few minutes ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562288\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: When I was something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: When you were something. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t actually sort of rest or not because it\u2019s exactly what I want but my reaction I think was just pounce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">I kind of don\u2019t like to sit on the couch in the morning for the same reason I don\u2019t like to do vigorous exercise in the morning.

Maybe [inaudible at 00:34:20] like not stretching <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">before or something or not having eaten and after not having moved and having been awake for a long time.

Or the week has gone on and on. I haven\u2019t cooled down from the week either but Mondays are generally coming from a pretty concertive and different place. Do you have any thoughts about why I pounced? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: I sort of remember something about that at the moment but I am wondering whether what you just said is a certain kind of acknowledgement of vulnerability that is sort of maybe partly taking back something that you had seen in me? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: About the insurance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well, yes or about whatever I was reacting to, yes. And then, you know Mondays I come in and I feel half baked. I feel like it reflects a little not really presenting the same way.

Yes, now that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: But I didn\u2019t react to it that way. This is what\u2019s confusing or upsetting to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: I see is that you like feeling I\u2019m that way. Naturally, I mean of course you do. And yet [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: And yet I can\u2019t handle it somehow or I handle that sort of weird.

I\u2019m not saying that because you seem exactly aggressive to me but it sounds like it might be a little that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: My persona?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: When you use words like pounce I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes well there\u2019s a lot more where that came from. It does come out because you started talking about bus driving and it went away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ve just got a few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: The association about the couch, do you still have that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s something possible to me, yes. I do take your point. I think you\u2019re right that you\u2019re talking maybe you\u2019re not being disengaged but a little unprepared, whereas I seem like very engaged with it in that moment. Maybe not prepared in a way for what you\u2019re going to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: And I feel that way now, today, in this session on Monday in the afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Like not quite comfortable on the couch or warmed up?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562288\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Warmed up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Okay, yes. That\u2019s what I thought you were saying, yes. So it seems to fit although I\u2019m not sure what more to do with it. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: I had some really me experiences in Maine. The lake has frozen over which I never, doesn\u2019t happen very often. We walked and cross-country skied and snow shoed all around these little crevices and bays and I was a bit onto the open ice. It was so mysterious on the icebergs. There\u2019s snow on top <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">of ice but there\u2019s some areas with black ice. And it\u2019s this huge body of water underneath and it\u2019s alive and you can hear it when you\u2019re on top of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">And we skied over some island and there\u2019s all these feature of the island you could never see in a kayak or something you might never see, too high. It was very cool; it was like being on a desert. There were all these patterns in the snow that you see in deserts with sand. It was a very open place <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">there was so much space there for everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">My parents live in the country. They live on this big apple orchard and it\u2019s surrounded by farms. And then there\u2019s a big annex (ph) to the east and the lake to the west and the other annex to the west. And it\u2019s all within five miles. You can just go anywhere on skis or by foot or by horse. And yet everybody\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">talking about yoga and trolleying in the river. It\u2019s an interesting blend of rural oak and cosmopolitan people who have a sense of what\u2019s happening in the world. It was very, very hard to come back to my lion\u2019s mouth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: They\u2019re savvy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Oh, thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Are they new?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s not quite snowy enough for boots. It\u2019s five blocks so we\u2019re in good enough shape but it would take a little more than [inaudible at 00:45:42]on my shoes so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:45:48].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
