AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">CLIENT: You have a charger for the 5-S?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yes, I usually don\u2019t actually -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s how lights go on for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s your lucky day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I was going to buy it at [inaudible at 00:00:18]. My car\u2019s in the shop and so I bring my laptop. And the shuttle drives me right here, I can go over to Larry\u2019s. I left my laptop in the car, which of course has my wire in it. I was at Staples; they\u2019re $20 just for the wire and I guess I bought <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">a bunch of other stuff that I actually needed. But I wasn\u2019t upset about leaving my laptop. There was a piece of I guess plastic was hanging down from my axel and you really don\u2019t notice it until you\u2019re driving on the city streets that are curved up like that from all the construction; it drags. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And normally that would be something that would bum me out because I\u2019m crazy busy and when am I going to take my car in. And, but I had to take it in for the oil change so it really just never bothered me like it would. And I mean I\u2019m still, this isn\u2019t some sort of cruel joke on Cameron. I met with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">a client yesterday, hired me. I\u2019m meeting with a woman tonight. I\u2019ve got a she should hire me but I don\u2019t know that she will. I\u2019ve got a consultation today where this is what I\u2019ve got to learn how to do. It\u2019s a woman who number 1, I can\u2019t really understand her that well on the phone. Number 2, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">wants to do a phone consultation. She kept trying to get advice out of me and I said I don\u2019t have time for set-up. I don\u2019t know enough of the facts; I really can\u2019t tell you what you need to do. And she of course disagreed when I told her what the law was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So I\u2019ve got to find a way to basically not, give her the right information, let her not take it, and then when she gets sued hire me as opposed to just not taking her phone call. And there\u2019s probably some point in the future where I wouldn\u2019t even bother helping this woman maybe, I don\u2019t know. I hope <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">not; I hope I always have the opportunity but I\u2019m busy. And I\u2019m getting an inquiry plus a day whether by the website or not everything of course is going to pan out but it doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s all right; I\u2019ve already paid for a year\u2019s worth of this paid search and I\u2019m two weeks, assuming I build <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I\u2019ve got two tenants under retainer. Well one of them I\u2019ve got to follow up and that\u2019s my Section 8 so I\u2019m not really expecting anything from those folks but their landlord will pay me. And then another kid came in, it\u2019s a Pembroke case, just they screwed everything, the landlord screwed everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">up. The woman who does the rental, her husband comes out and yells at the guy, threatens to kill him, threatens to kill the dog. You kind of have a right to not have that stuff happen to you. Kind of diminishes your value. So that\u2019s a fun one; those people will be paying my fee. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And, I\u2019ve got oh in fact I have to check that voice-mail I\u2019ve got a guy in Plymouth who hired me to do a Power of Attorney and his wife is at the business. And the business just called me about something but I went in and I spoke to the social worker and she took my card and I think I\u2019ll send her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">a note and some more cards. She said yes we get people all the time. I was kind of surprised that the business doesn\u2019t have anyone to refer for the law. I\u2019m going to take a class. Some of the people asked me about it. And there\u2019s certain things that are sort of beyond what I can offer and it\u2019s good <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">to have that certification. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">But, yes, I got really drunk Saturday night and I\u2019ve learned my lesson. I get a really weird Wednesday I\u2019m going over to watch the dogs for Marcia. She\u2019s working and she sends me a text that when I get to her house to call her so I responded rut row. And then I\u2019m going down to her house, I was at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">a farm committee meeting, and I realized that the next day I had to go to business and notarize a document which I had to leave with them and my notary stamp is in Pembroke. So I started heading for Pembroke and she wrote don\u2019t worry about coming back to my house. And I flaked; I never called her and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">then the next day she said you never called me. I said I flaked and we spoke and her friend Laurel had called her up and said that I was smacking her on the ass and grabbing her boobs, which I know I smacked her on the ass but I\u2019ve smacked Marcia\u2019s 80-year-old mom on the ass. I guess it\u2019s improper behavior <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">but and Marcia starts it off with this here we go, another one of my friends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Wait, I\u2019m a little confused. So I thought you got really drunk on Saturday night and learned your lesson?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Well, I didn\u2019t learn it Saturday; I learned it after Laurel basically called Marcia and said Cameron is and I thought -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: This was last Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: This was last, well it ended up being Thursday that I finally spoke to Marcia. And <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Sorry, I\u2019m just a little confused. You said that the Saturday you got drunk was the previous Saturday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: So last Saturday, not this Saturday -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Ah, the one before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: The one before that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay, all right because the reason this didn\u2019t come up last week is because you hadn\u2019t heard from Laurel yet. I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Laurel talked to Marcia on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yes, okay, now I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: And there\u2019s a host of things I\u2019m leaving out that I did. I screamed at her in the car and just typical stuff I do. And this was a weird conversation with Marcia because I have no defense to it, I said how do I keep every time I think things are going along great I\u2019m fucking it up. What\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">and she kind of suggested that, and of course I said I don\u2019t even remember doing it and stuff, which is maybe you\u2019ve been drinking too much. And so then I got off the phone with Marcia and called Laurel and apologized to Laurel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Laurel said oh no big deal just, and she kind of said she did it in the guise of drinking too much, not Cameron\u2019s a pervert. But another friend of Marcia\u2019s that I had an issue with, who Marcia and I made some joke with her and they all took it seriously, told Marcia that Brenda and I were flirting once. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">So that was always a joke. Laurel\u2019s a big, fat 50-year-old woman. She\u2019s very nice but so I got a little anxious about that but I just kind of I got a text back from Marcia thanks for calling Laurel, that was cool, whatever, apologizing. And the tone of the text was a complete 180, can\u2019t wait to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">see you tonight, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">So but I think the big thing is, is that Number 1, I\u2019m on a lot of medication and that this is kind of the same thing that was going on where I was doing shots of Jameson, I\u2019m drinking hard alcohol. Saturday night we were at the House of Blues and I\u2019ve got my favorite bartender there and he just gives <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">you a little bit of tonic or cranberry with your vodka so I was trashed. And we ended up going out this Saturday to a show where we met, and because she had dogs we couldn\u2019t stay in Andover so I drove down there, we drove back up. And I got to her house; instead of having a vodka drink I drank a beer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">And when we got to, we went to dinner and I got a beer and I had one drink. I think maybe the guy I went to may have bought me another drink but by the time the show was over and we were at the car I was plum sober. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">So I think it\u2019s kind of the same thing where once I start drinking hard alcohol it hits me quicker and that means I\u2019m going to want to drink more quicker, it\u2019s like a spiraling effect. Where I drink a beer, my stomach is not, except for Guinness, I really can\u2019t drink beer very quickly. And if it is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">Guinness, Guinness is very low in alcohol and I don\u2019t get into that situation where I feel the need to keep getting fucked up and drink more and more and more; I can go and have one beer or two beers. So at least for a little while -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:11:07] development, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: I figured out that I just don\u2019t want Micah to win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s telling you not to drink?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: All the time. [Laughs] So, but <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: How about this one, how about we don\u2019t want Cameron to lose? That\u2019s better than Micah not winning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: That would make me a non-winner. That\u2019s what Marcia says to me when she beats me in Yahtzee. She says you\u2019re not a loser; you\u2019re a non-winner. Not that she always beats me in Yahtzee. Well, you know, it\u2019s just semantics. But I\u2019m rolling with things better. I had the kids a lot this weekend and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">I kind of rolled with that. The kids had their birthday party and Marcia didn\u2019t, I wanted her to go but she didn\u2019t want to go; she didn\u2019t want that to be the first time she met Jess or whatever. Plus, old friend Erica was there and she wouldn\u2019t even make eye contact with me, Jess\u2019 old friend who said <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">all those things about me and whose mom was crazy. Basically she wasn\u2019t a help to me. Talked to her husband, no problems. She just wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Just think of [inaudible at 00:12:28] win or losing. What I had in mind was as you\u2019re saying with the drinking often you lose. That\u2019s the point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m more concerned about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yes, I know, Micah not winning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yes, because I don\u2019t drink any more or any less. [Laughing] But, so things seem to be moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Good, that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Like today -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: The work picking up has made a huge difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yes. And I\u2019ve been getting up every morning early, getting to the office or just today I just got up and I didn\u2019t really even had a whole lot to do but at least it got me up and thinking and I did some things. And, last night I fell asleep on the couch watching Criminal Minds and woke up, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">whatever. But still I was up at 5:00. Sunday I was in bed all day, a week ago, because I was hung I was and I think I\u2019m having this tendency, even though Saturday night I didn\u2019t get really drunk I had a little buzz. I think I might\u2019ve had a vodka drink when we got back to Marcia\u2019s. But I just think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">by Sunday I\u2019m so damn tired I literally slept all day and I stayed there Sunday night and just slept. I think that is part of just kind of being out of shape. That I\u2019m doing a lot, I\u2019m going upstairs, I\u2019m trying to, I\u2019m saying I might even try to work out. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">But it\u2019s not like depression sleep because it\u2019s not night after night after night. If I had fallen asleep last night, the normal thing would\u2019ve been for me to wake up at 10:00 or wake up and be tired. But I was, boom, at 5:00 I\u2019m up, didn\u2019t even think about going back to bed. I didn\u2019t have a coffee <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">until 7:15 when I went to Starbucks because I didn\u2019t realize that Andover Honda didn\u2019t open until 7:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">So the money\u2019s I think the idea that money\u2019s coming in like normally it would be a day, today, where I\u2019d fly up to Pembroke just to see what checks I got and I wouldn\u2019t have gotten any. But I\u2019m expecting thousands of dollars. But I think I don\u2019t need it today. I waste two hours of my time on gas <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">and just being in the car. And I got to go up there, turn around, and come back. I might not even get there for today\u2019s mail. I got this phone consultation at 4:00; I got a meeting with this woman in Plymouth at 5:00, 5:30, whatever. Why am I trying to kill myself, and I\u2019m probably going to go see Marcia <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D2\">tonight. So I figure take your fucking car in, there\u2019s no reason that you have to go to Beverly today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">And so I\u2019m just being a little still doing the dumb things but I\u2019m just not getting upset about it. Driving to Pembroke, it threw me for a loop but I wasn\u2019t bitching and moaning and yelling and screaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yes, just like I mean part of the way it seems like you\u2019re, what feels to you to be having more work is that the world isn\u2019t just fucking you over. And so when something happens that previously would\u2019ve felt like the world fucking you over, doesn\u2019t feel so much like that because things are <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">happening too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Well, forget my laptop, all right I\u2019ll work on my phone. Oh I have no battery. Oh, you know I forgot my firewire; it\u2019s in my laptop bag. And oh I got to went to Staples, did some shopping, and I\u2019ve still got some time and I said oh, Dr. Chad might have a actually I thought for sure you\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">have one. So I went to Larry\u2019s and started typing up a post for my Facebook page. But I spent all of my I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting any business out of it but I got these clients who are buying a small condo. So I want to write them an e-mail kind of explaining what I think they should be prepared for. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">Now that e-mail is basically going to be my post. So I\u2019m writing a post and I\u2019m going to turn it into an e-mail and say hey go look at my post. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">So I\u2019m finding some ways to get around my stupidity. Not always, and something that I think is lurking there is the way that this business is coming in. If I fuck something up, there\u2019s no contact that\u2019s going to stop sending me business. It\u2019s the Internet. These people are calling me, connecting with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">me and hiring me just because of a [very nice] (ph) interpersonal relationship. And, so I think there\u2019s a little, there\u2019s less pressure and I feel like I\u2019m going to be doing this enough that it\u2019s going to be second nature for me. I\u2019m going to be in the court all the time and dealing with these issues <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">And the client I had there (ph) I\u2019m blowing everything off, I haven\u2019t been doing anything, she hasn\u2019t sent me any more money, blah, blah, blah. But she gets a 14-day notice to quit. That\u2019s her retaliatory eviction because within 6 months she\u2019s reported him to the but now I\u2019ve got to start getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">going so I\u2019ve got my contractor going down there to look at the house today. And I\u2019m not worried at all because I know it\u2019s a retaliatory eviction; I\u2019m going to have to just [inaudible at 00:18:46]. And now I\u2019ll sue him in Superior Court. I don\u2019t know but, so yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">There\u2019s no pressure about the Natick (ph) thing. I got three close three purchase closings this month and they\u2019re all nice ones. One of them my buddy Paul sent me so I\u2019m going to give him 40% of the title insurance. It\u2019s a cash deal, simple. And I mean the title insurance premium is going $1,700 so <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">I\u2019m still going to be making a good chunk. And so I\u2019m not even, I don\u2019t even feel anxious about still being so far behind. I still have rent to pay and I\u2019ve gotten a little better with the website but I\u2019ve got to start spending money to make my life easier. So I\u2019ve signed up for E-Recording so I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200692\">have to like Andover I wanted to I have purchases in Cambridge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">Well the last day of the month to go stand in line at Andover it\u2019s going to be an hour, two hours, three, or you pay someone $50 to do it. Or I could\u2019ve done $10 a document which would add up but I can get a subscription for $300 through the title company, $450 (ph) per document. And I could charge <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">the buyer or the seller, whoever is responsible for the recording fees the $450 on top of that. So $300 is going to save me from having to run in. And I\u2019ve done the same things with Barnstable Registry and Virginia Beach Registry where I can print stuff online and this is extra money. I\u2019ve got an outlay <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B2\">for the subscriptions but it saves me from having to run somewhere and most importantly having to do it for a couple of documents [inaudible at 00:20:57]. I mean I\u2019m notorious for forgetting to print something out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">So there\u2019s this kind of, I feel like I\u2019m still in the hole but it\u2019s not going down and I\u2019m kind of in place and just about by the end of the month I\u2019ll have money to pay back to Flo, I might start sending you a dollar a week or something. If the money comes in that people say they\u2019re going to send me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">plus these closings, it\u2019s going to be a great month. And I\u2019ve already got a closing lined up for April. And Gus, an original member of BNI (ph), did my old website, he\u2019s buying a house down in Massachusetts. So that\u2019s a referral I have for Vivian and I can do the closing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">So things seem to be cranking along. I\u2019m not worried about the Chicago Title thing anymore. It\u2019s even on my list on file to claim with my insurance company and let the chips fall where they may. I\u2019m not going to authorize any settlement, fuck that, I don\u2019t know if I have that right or not. But just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">things are, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not getting upset and I\u2019m not getting anxious but just they\u2019re rolling over me a lot easier, especially the car thing. Originally I was frustrated and now I\u2019m just, it just goes away. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">Things are going well with the kids. I was, I thought I behaved pretty well for the most part last night. Wasn\u2019t snappy or I get a little firm with Ian because he just doesn\u2019t listen to you. But Jess, and she\u2019s driving me crazy because she\u2019s broke and one of the reasons I\u2019m such a hole because we <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">had to pay $5,000 in taxes; she gave me $500. So I had to put the rest out of there out of I don\u2019t know what, rent money or whatever. Lord knows when I\u2019m, if and when I\u2019m ever going to get the money back for that. She wants to buy the house. I asked for money for health everything\u2019s like I don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200712\">any money, I don\u2019t have any money, I don\u2019t have any money, I don\u2019t have any money. It\u2019s frustrating because she\u2019s going to live her life and do what she wants but landlord-tenant is not where I wanted to land. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">Conveyancing wasn\u2019t where I wanted to land. Estate planning, none of this is what I wanted to do but this is where I\u2019m going to be making money. So I\u2019ve got to get the divorce done and [pause] I don\u2019t know. Here\u2019s a question. Originally I was going to use the square reader but I never set it up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">I really haven\u2019t let people know that I do take credit cards. PayPal has one now too, PayPal here, and it\u2019s slightly less commission but the thing I like about it is the money instantly appears in your PayPal account. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">And I think with this landlord-tenant thing, I\u2019m going to have more people who aren\u2019t going to have the cash for a retainer. And it comes with this little PayPal here, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover. Is that unprofessional if I put that on the window of my office? I know there are some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">people who are going to say that, the same people who say don\u2019t do free consultations because that makes you seem cheap. But it isn\u2019t all bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">It\u2019s like with Jess, having her reputation and her whatever it is she is afraid of by advertising and marketing and doing the things you need to do to get divorce cases, she\u2019s not making any money off that. And I guess I answered my question but do you think it is unprofessional to have that on my window <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">with my chamber sticker and ? I think people would walk by, they would see attorney at law, see that I took credit cards or as they came in for a consultation they would see that because even on the bylaws it says that I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve got to change that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: Doesn\u2019t seem to me to be a big deal but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes. The big deal is that if someone\u2019s giving me a retainer, the reason I never really set up credit cards before is because the money\u2019s supposed to go into your trust account. But if they so you\u2019re paying yourself for doing the work and if they dispute the charge, they pull that money out <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">of your account. Well that\u2019s your [inaudible at 00:26:57] account and that can, number one, bounce the account if the money\u2019s not in there and number two, if the money\u2019s not in there you\u2019ve got to put the money in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">But with these landlord-tenant cases, I\u2019m getting $1,500 retainers and so that should be something I could cover if it bounces but I could do it all through the PayPal. If it bounces it\u2019s going to bounce through PayPal. So I just take the I\u2019ve got to figure out how PayPal sucks the money out but don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">have them suck it out the trust account. And then I can actually set up the trust account as one of my transfers and as soon as it\u2019s in there set up the transfer. It\u2019s probably not a completely, the way the Board of our overseers would like to see it but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen to the frequency <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">that, I don\u2019t see a lot of people using credit cards. But I think some people will and it\u2019s a difference of these fucking payment plans where people owe me money and, you know how it is when people owe you money. They never pay you. So, yes, I think I\u2019m going to put that up. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">I think it\u2019s important now to get this remodeling going and done. I keep telling my designer let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go and he says okay [inaudible at 00:28:38] and nothing happening. I don\u2019t know, he may have ordered the cabinets and that\u2019s just one up. At least get the cabinets and especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">this month when there\u2019s a little bit of cash flow. I think that makes a difference when people walk by and see a nice office. So I don\u2019t know. Things are still going good. Things are going well with Marcia. She complained that the next time she\u2019s going to see the kids is the end of the month for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F2\">Globetrotters. So I said well, come have dinner with us. I understand why she didn\u2019t want to come to the birthday party. And of course it\u2019s going to be somewhat awkward for me but I think we should. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">THERAPIST: Meaning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: She means Jess or ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: Yes, that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: Oh okay, yes, that I understand. I thought you meant just having dinner and that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yes, so it\u2019s going to happen and I don\u2019t know. Whatever. [Pause] And I haven\u2019t even seen that this direct marketing thing is going to work. I\u2019d like it too because the landlord-tenant stuff is not easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: The direct marketing for closings? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: Dollars, yes. There\u2019s meeting realtors and very, what I think are -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yes, I just [inaudible at 00:30:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: real intangibles but seller wraps are, you get a seller wrap every once in a while and you\u2019ve earned your money. Or don\u2019t earn it; you work more than, but most of them are a title. There\u2019s no problem with title. Sometimes I feel ashamed for what I charge. That\u2019s another thing. I\u2019ve got these <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">clients who bought a house. They fucked up the wetlands and they signed an agreement not to and they\u2019re supposed to had fixed it. I get a call again from the attorney and I said listen, I\u2019ll see if they want to hire me for this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">So I sent them an e-mail. I said this is what they represented to me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I would have to do an investigation to get up to speed. You should call the developer to find out what\u2019s going on. If you want to hire me you can do that too. There\u2019s the e-mail, sort of asking some stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">and then there was another one oh by the way what\u2019s your hourly rate? And I said it\u2019s $225 and then $2,500 retainer, knowing that they don\u2019t have that money. But if I\u2019m going to take on a case like that, I want to make sure, I can afford now to make sure <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll take the case, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: if I take the case to make sure I can pay. I know the woman\u2019s mother does my taxes; she\u2019s my CPA so she does my taxes. And that she can get a loan. But I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve mentioned the retainer before. So, and stuck at the $195 for a while and now I\u2019m worth more than that compared to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200991\">what other attorneys are charging. And the Section 8 people, if they have to pay it\u2019s only going to be $195 but when I ask them in court for money it\u2019s going to be $225. So, I don\u2019t know. Business seems to be going in the right direction and it\u2019s but I\u2019m working; I\u2019ve got to work. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s right to do the work [inaudible at 00:33:11].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">CLIENT: Well yesterday I was even at the point where I had all this stuff to do and really wasn\u2019t I did what I needed to. Got caught up with my titles, I\u2019ve got a closing this month at the end of the month, a cash deal I\u2019ve got to do the title for but I\u2019ll do all that today. Make sure my people in <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D1\">April that they tell Bank of America use me as their closing attorney. And then make a letter. I really don\u2019t have a whole lot to do. I\u2019ve got some discovery on this one case but I want the first check from this guy first. So I don\u2019t even feel there\u2019s a point where I was feeling overwhelmed. Oh God, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D2\">I\u2019m busy; I\u2019m going to be busy forever, blah, blah, blah. And last night as far as I thought well I\u2019ll watch Criminal Minds. [inaudible at 00:34:02] watch Criminal Minds, there you go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">Still went and got a bunch of Chinese food that I puked up this morning but I\u2019ll work on that. So [pause] I think even Marcia has kind of noticed that she said she was going to meet with her friend Arya last night and Arya just came over in the afternoon. And I think part of it is of course she wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F1\">her own time or whatever, but I think she also recognizes that when I go over there, that\u2019s cutting into my time as well and part of my stress is from not getting slept on. I kind of felt that a little bit and also to be okay with it. Have fun whether I agree or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Wait, I\u2019m confused. Have fun -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: With Arya. Yes, and of course she was texting me all last night because she was watching the Housewives of Beverly Hill, I think with Arya though but that\u2019s fine. Once handball starts out all hell\u2019s going to break loose. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Are you going to juggle work, Marcia and handball?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">CLIENT: And my workouts. I want to get there today if I can get on but probably should start seeing him now. There\u2019s a chiropractor in the group and she does acupuncture as well. And I don\u2019t know this might be a good opportunity she\u2019s in north Westford. I can\u2019t go to Essex Court any more, it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A71\">but maybe she can start. And I need the chiropractor just to keep my back or whatever but there was one day where I was revved up, just fucking revved up. This was back when, years ago went to the chiropractor, we were trading some business and I mean when I left that place I was so relaxed I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A72\">incapable of operating heavy machinery including a car. That\u2019s how relaxed I was. Just shit. So I think there are things that physically even mentally that acupuncture can help with, even Crohn\u2019s. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Crohn\u2019s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m wondering so maybe you can get me off some of the medication. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if Micah likes working with alternative. But that\u2019s a scary proposition just to begin with because it\u2019s easy to take a pill as oppose to scheduling an appointment. And what do you do when you go on <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB1\">vacation? I don\u2019t know. But she has huge tits. I\u2019m not a boob guy either but the way she does she does some different technique adjusting the back where she grabs you from the front. A homely face but you know. Just I know I can\u2019t smack her ass or grab her boobs. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">THERAPIST: It will help if you\u2019re not drinking hard alcohol before you go in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s not going to happen. So, yes I bought some beer; put some beer in Marcia\u2019s fridge. That\u2019s what I do when I go out. Everybody drinks beer. I don\u2019t drink. When it\u2019s boys\u2019 night out, that\u2019s, a couple guys on there love their bourbon and whiskey and real aficionados. But after a game <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF1\">everybody goes out for dinner, you have a beer maybe two beers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Well I think also I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just partly the alcohol but it\u2019s probably also if you \u2018re feeling a little better things are picking up, it\u2019s probably easier not to have to drink so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">CLIENT: No, I enjoy it. [Laughing] I had a good time. And it was funny because we went to the concert and then we went to my friend Booty\u2019s party, his 50th birthday party, and I talked to him yesterday -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">THERAPIST: That what, you mentioned that last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">CLIENT: and I talked to him yesterday and he\u2019s trying to apologize. He said did I see you, did I talk to you? Man I was messed up. I said I know I saw you but I was pretty wasted too, so. But going to sell the condo. I feel like I can do without the $1,500 now. That\u2019s a big thing. And it\u2019s another <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B71\">nice piece of business I can give Patricia. Jess doesn\u2019t get the finances about this stuff. That\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating. I get the piece of paper that says we owe so much in taxes, $70,000 to the IRS, but we have a deal where we\u2019ve got an offer of compromise for much less. And I\u2019m trying to explain to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B72\">her that for that paper to get taken off we just have to pay what we owe the IRS, not the base amount on the and she doesn\u2019t understand that. And someone\u2019s advising her and telling her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">It\u2019s like my fucking mom. I say Jess e I do this for a fucking living. And everybody\u2019s going to argue with me but that\u2019s not actually a lien, it\u2019s a notice of a lien. The lien pops up as soon as you file your taxes. They assess, once they assess how much you owe which is what you file. That\u2019s when the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B91\">lien, this is just notice that the lien is out there and hasn\u2019t been paid. So, yes, if someone wanted to do an escrow they would use that amount do one and a half or whatever. So I\u2019m thinking yes, if you can, first of all they didn\u2019t record anything against Huntington County so that probably won\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B92\">come up. And maybe it\u2019ll come up through the lender on the short sale but pay off my taxes. That\u2019s $300 to $315 less a month I have to pay for back taxes. Same thing with the state, it\u2019s a total of $477 I pay every month. That could be going to my health insurance I\u2019m three months behind on, I\u2019m 30, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B93\">I\u2019m beyond, I\u2019m actually going beyond the 30 days. I\u2019m just lucky because in New Hampshire there\u2019s no reason for them to drop my coverage because I can just pick it up again. So they just keep cashing the checks. They send you a notice that says oh we\u2019re canceling, we\u2019re canceling but <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562188\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">Would be nice. I\u2019m trying to build a cushion. I have $350 put away towards that. But I\u2019m going to be in a situation where at the end of March because I going to have to get my P&amp;L, my CPA my estimate, what my estimated taxes should be. I\u2019ve definitely done better than last year but I don\u2019t want to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB1\">hit with another $5,000 tax bill. So I guess I\u2019ll have real things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">Then my stepmom comes down [inaudible at 00:42:50] blown when I hand her a check for most of her money back because I told her I was going to give her a check in South Carolina. And I got all upset with my brother and forgot and then had to pay the taxes and I didn\u2019t have the money. [Pause] And I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD1\">even been content with my closing business. There\u2019s not as much pressure to I still feel like I should be doing a lot more closing-wise and hopefully that\u2019ll pick up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C1\">CLIENT: Can you give me a ride?
