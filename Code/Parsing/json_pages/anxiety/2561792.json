Hi Jessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20013\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014\">CLIENT: Hi, Debbie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20015\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016\">THERAPIST: So, I want to ask you about your homework, but there was something you wanted to tell me about prior to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20017\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018\">CLIENT: Yes. So, in fact, I didn\u2019t get a chance to bring home my notebook that has what the student said, but as you know I work with young children, I think I mentioned that in the beginning of our sessions together -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20019\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C\">THERAPIST: No, you didn\u2019t. Tell me about what your role is and what you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001D\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E\">CLIENT: Sure. I have a Masters\u2019 Degree in counseling and personal services. Basically what that is, is that I\u2019m a guidance counselor in a school, and I work with children ages kindergarten through fifth grade. So you get a whole range. So I\u2019ve been working with students that age for, like, about eleven, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E1\">twelve years. God I feel old saying that. Not that it\u2019s so long, but you know, I\u2019ve been doing it for a number of years. So everything that comes up with the students that I work with, you know, a lot of times I\u2019ll have something that\u2019s very interesting that means a lot to me, and if that\u2019s the case, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E2\">then a lot of times I\u2019ll write it down. But in this particular instance, there was one student that I\u2019d been working with for a number of years, and he decided last Wednesday when we had session, that he wanted to share with the rest of the group what the five beliefs were \u2013 his five beliefs of life, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E3\">how to have a successful life, and it was his top five beliefs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020\">THERAPIST: He just came up with them himself out of the blue ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024\">CLIENT: Out of the blue. He \u2013 nothing really had spurred it, it was just basically this particular child decided to share with the group what he felt were the five keys to success, you know, I don\u2019t know if he really said to a happy life or whatever, he just said \u201cThese are my beliefs on life\u201d. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200241\">what was really interesting was that, I wasn\u2019t thinking about it at first when he first started, he was like \u201cLet\u2019s start at number five and go all the way down,\u201d and I wasn\u2019t really thinking about it, but I realized as he was saying them and explaining them that they were actually the philosophies <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200242\">of REBT. So it was really interesting, his first one being, you know, don\u2019t expect that everybody is going to like you, and, you know, that it might upset you, or that it might bother you, you know, if something, oh \u2013 no \u2013 better say: or you may bother yourself -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20025\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026\">THERAPIST: Well caught, well caught \u2013 you used the words expressing a more accurate REBT attitude \u2013 that you, not IT, may bother you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20027\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20029\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A\">CLIENT: He didn\u2019t say it like that, because he doesn\u2019t know, really, but he said, you know, and I don\u2019t even know, the way he \u2013 he\u2019s very eloquent, this child, he\u2019s very bright, and he was able to put it in a way where he said, \u201cAnd you may be upset, and you may not like it, but that\u2019s okay, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A1\">you have to tolerate it.\u201d Like, he was using all the lingo that I\u2019d been reading in the book, and it was, it was strange because it was striking, actually. Strange isn\u2019t really the word. It was striking and astounding because I couldn\u2019t believe that after, I said \u201cCan I write this down?\u201d when he first <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A2\">started talking, but I wasn\u2019t really linking it to the work we were doing, and then when I started writing it down and I looked back I realized, holy cow. Especially later on, on the bus when I was on my way home, and I was reading the book, I\u2019m saying \u2013 everything he was saying \u2013 seemed to fit ...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20029-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C\">THERAPIST: Which book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E\">CLIENT: Sorry. The REBT \u2013 I forget the title. The Rational Emotional Behavioral Therapy book written by you and your husband (Albert Ellis) \u2013 I realized that it was the same concepts more or less, and that these concepts were \u2013 it was the same concepts as what the student had said. He didn\u2019t get to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E1\">finish, because the sessions are only thirty minutes, and we had a fire drill, actually, so he had to stop. But he got up to three, and those top three were pretty significant and they all matched up to the concepts and philosophies of REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20031\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032\">THERAPIST: Out of the mouths of babes, eh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20033\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So yeah. So that was interesting. And then, moving just ahead, today I had a student -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20035\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20036\">THERAPIST: Before you move ahead, let me say that one of the many things you contribute to your students and others by the way you behave, by the attitudes you express and display is that you demonstrate REBT principles as a model \u2013 by modelling them., Without giving them a lesson in REBT your model <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200361\">it \u2013 which can make solid impressions for others particularly children at their young ages. Also \u2013 when you do that \u2013 you reinforce those healthy awarenesses within yourself. And also, when one works on oneself as you are, it can be even easier: a) to recognize the wisdom from others, i.e. your students, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200362\">and b) to more powerfully emphasize, reinforce, reward others\u2026 in an appropriate way, meaning encouragement <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20037\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m more aware of what is ?...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20039\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019re more aware of the healthiness and helpfulness of that attitude. And we hope that the children imbibe those principles and continue believing and practicing them throughout their lives, because the sooner they imbibe them, the better, otherwise we, as adults -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C\">CLIENT: get a little stuck or rigid. A little more rigid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E\">THERAPIST: Well, it can mean there will be more work to do to undo what\u2019s unhealthy and replace it with what is healthy, which is in part what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040\">CLIENT: Yeah, I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20041\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042\">THERAPIST: Okay. So then -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20043\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044\">CLIENT: Oh. And then also, another interesting thing \u2013 so today, one of my students, we were having a session, and she \u2013 this was actually, I want to say \u2013 it wasn\u2019t that it was any more or less powerful than what happened with the other student, but this is where I used REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20045\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046\">THERAPIST: With her or with yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20047\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048\">CLIENT: With my student. With my student.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20049\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A\">THERAPIST: Aah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C\">CLIENT: And it was really successful, and so can I share?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050\">THERAPIST: Please do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20051\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052\">CLIENT: Okay. So what happened is one of my students who is, she\u2019s a fifth grader, she\u2019s very mature for her age, she was I just want to give a little background, only because it just shows that these things can affect the way we think. Just affects all of us regardless of how much we\u2019ve been through, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200521\">how little we\u2019ve been through. She was adopted at two years old, by a really beautiful, lovely family, who has given her warmth and a good home and everything as far as what I know, but you know, like any child her age, and just given she\u2019s a little more, she\u2019s a bigger girl, a little bigger, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200522\">a little less confident in certain ways, she\u2019s had some struggles, just emotionally. But behaviorally, in the classroom and everything, she\u2019s considered to be more of \u2013 I don\u2019t want to use the word goody two-shoes, but in this case I will, just to make \u2013 just to give you the picture, that she doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200523\">really do anything, she doesn\u2019t act out, she\u2019s not one that the teacher would say, you know so-and-so is \u2013 and let\u2019s just call this girl, I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s a very, just basic name. The teacher would never say this child misbehaved. That\u2019s not a common \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t expect that. So what happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200524\">was just today, this particular student came to session and was really upset because she said that she didn\u2019t do her math homework the night before I guess when she had her time to do her homework, she didn\u2019t do it. She came to school today, and the teacher asked \u201cWhere\u2019s everybodys math homework\u201d. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200525\">Well, knowing that her father is a very strict, strict, strict man, she got panicky. She was also panicking on the way to school, knowing that she didn\u2019t do it. She got panicky, and what she did was, she erased another boy\u2019s name off of his paper, who she knows does very well in math, so she knew it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200526\">would be a good grade, she erased his name and put her name instead. So, quite sneaky and very, you know, mischievous.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20051-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20053\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20055\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056\">THERAPIST: Not good behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20057\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058\">CLIENT: Not good behavior, not something that we want to encourage. But what happened was, she was explaining this to me so, my immediate thought \u2013 how I usually am, I try as much as I can not to show judgment to the children, and that\u2019s before REBT and even now. But sometimes I\u2019m a lot more of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200581\">side of just \u2013 well anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, now I know REBT. I have the concepts. I\u2019m getting it. So she was worried, guilty, anxious, didn\u2019t like the fact \u2013 because the class did find out, by the way. The whole class did find out that she did this act. So she was embarrassed, she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200582\">telling me all the feelings. \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed, in front of the whole class, I can\u2019t believe I did this,\u201d she was really beating herself up. You could see she felt the guilt. So I walked her through it, and I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, but I walked her through it. She felt very panicky, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200583\">is why she decided to do what she did, was this the choice that she, you know, I did not use the word \u201cshould\u201d. I said \u201cAs a choice, probably was it the best choice? No.\u201d I said, \u201cWas it out of an act of panic and sheer terror? Yes.\u201d Because that really was what she expressed, was that she really felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200584\">that she would get in trouble if her father did find out she didn\u2019t do her math homework. And there was clearly \u2013 and then we discussed, and this was my little additive, that maybe there was some part of her that did want to get found out in some way, and we kind of added that into it. But where I used <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200585\">REBT is that, and this was very interesting, is that a few minutes before, when she was telling the story, she talked about the boy whose homework she had erased, and she said he\u2019s a really nice kid, that she did it to, right, who she chose. Then within the same sentence, she said that this same boy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200586\">did something very bad, she used these words, that he went into the computer and pulled some website, right, and that he got in huge trouble for it, and she said \u201cProbably even bigger trouble than I got.\u201d And I said \u201cAre you aware of what you just said?\u201d I said \u201cWithin the same sentence you said \u201cOh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200587\">because she was worried, she was worried that she was no longer going to be considered a nice girl, that\u2019s what it was. So I said \u201cAre you aware that you just said, about this boy, that he\u2019s a nice boy. And within the same sentence, you said a few weeks back, he did a bad act, got in much worse trouble, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200588\">but you still think he\u2019s a nice boy.\u201d And she \u2013 her whole face changed. I said, \u201cSo are you aware that you might not have made the best choice, but are you going to beat yourself up about it all day long, and I\u2019m the worst \u2013 I\u2019m trying not to say her name \u2013 I\u2019m the worst, I\u2019m the worst child, no one\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200589\">ever going to think I\u2019m nice, you know, the whole class looks at me differently \u2013 I said, people forget, and you should too!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20057-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20059\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005A\">THERAPIST: Preferably should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005B\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C\">CLIENT: Preferably, yeah. And I didn\u2019t really put it exactly in that way, I can\u2019t really remember how that went. The point was that she \u2013 her body language \u2013 things changed when she realized that she didn\u2019t have to beat herself up over that, and that I think what was even more, like, significant, was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C1\">the fact that she was \u2013 because I read this in the book \u2013 was that we condemn ourselves so much more than we would somebody else. So she was saying that this boy that did something that wasn\u2019t the best decision was a nice boy in the same sentence. But yet when she did it, she\u2019s now a bad girl, nobody\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C2\">going to like her, the whole class is going to think she\u2019s terrible, because she did something that wasn\u2019t the best, or did not make the smartest choice, or the wisest choice with her homework. And then I said, \u201cDid you learn from this? Maybe next time you won\u2019t\u201cAnd she did, and she explained to me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C3\">she said next time I\u2019ll think before \u2013 you know, and it was nothing that I put in her mouth, it was really, you could see that once she calmed down, and wasn\u2019t being so hard on herself, she was able to get the lesson. I have to tell you, I was pretty shocked that she of all people did that. She really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C4\">it was out of character for, you know, it was just not a typical behavior that I\u2019ve ever seen her do before. So I think she was even especially harder on herself, because it\u2019s not how she considers herself to sort of, you know, she monitors her behavior much more \u2013 she\u2019s much harsher than maybe another <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005C5\">kid that you\u2019d say, \u201cOh, I expected that from him\u201d. So, anyway, that was\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005D\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a valuable lesson for her. May I suggest, if it feels appropriate next time you see her, and tell me what you think about what I\u2019m about to suggest, you bring up the notion that neither she nor the boy are good or nice or bad or terrible, they do good or bad things -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005F\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20060\">CLIENT: I did that already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20061\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20062\">THERAPIST: Oh you did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20063\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20064\">CLIENT: I did. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20065\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20066\">THERAPIST: Well done, yeah. And so she understands -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20067\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20068\">CLIENT: She got the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20069\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006A\">THERAPIST: that she\u2019s worthwhile. It\u2019s preferable that she do good things, because the outcome is better, but even if she does a bad thing, and I already sense from what you told me that she got this message from you, she\u2019s still worthwhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006B\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006C\">CLIENT: She got the message, yeah. She did. Her body language changed and everything once the connections were made. But I think that originally she came down looking pretty somber and concerned that she did that. I think even the teacher noticed that it wasn\u2019t so terrible because the teacher said \u201cI\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006C1\">not even going to call your parents, I just want you to write an apology, come up during lunch and write an apology note\u201d. So she didn\u2019t even have to really worry about her father\u2019s wrath, because I know him and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be too keen on that, so. But that wasn\u2019t the concern. She learned from it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006B-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006D\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006E\">THERAPIST: Good. So do you think from now on when you see her, you\u2019ll reinforce that she\u2019s worthwhile, whether she does good or bad, though it\u2019s preferable, because of beneficial outcomes, that she strive to do more good things ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006F\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20070\">CLIENT: Oh, absolutely. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20071\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20072\">THERAPIST: Wonderful! Good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20073\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20074\">CLIENT: And I did my work, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20075\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20076\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I want to know about. Reflecting now on your homework, it was to do ABC\u2019s with more thorough investigation, identification, and expression of irrational beliefs, the shoulds, the musts, and then doing thorough D\u2019s and E\u2019s, and then we were talking about you giving attention to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200761\">your need in your own head to be positive and cheerful for the sake of your girlfriend. There was a discomfort about you feeling sick all of the time, and your concern that your girlfriend doesn\u2019t know your more carefree other side. So tell me about your homework. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20077\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20078\">CLIENT: Okay so. Do you want me just to go through with an example? Start with like an example?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20079\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007A\">THERAPIST: Well, first of all, in general, tell me, do you feel you did your homework adequately? Did you do a rush-minute job? Or did you think about it substantially? How\u2019s it going? And then I want to hear at least one example, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007B\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007C\">CLIENT: So, this week was really really challenging for me as I\u2019ve mentioned, in the past sessions, that physically it\u2019s been quite a really challenging. Probably out of my entire 35 years, physically the most challenging. I\u2019ve had some other physical ailments and things, but this by far, just because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007C1\">it relates to my neck, has been really difficult. So it has affected my handwriting and my ability to write -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007D\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007E\">THERAPIST: Temporarily. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007F\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20080\">CLIENT: Temporarily, yes. So unfortunately, I think I had seen you once between sessions and I\u2019d mentioned that I hadn\u2019t really done my homework, and really that was the reason, so I was doing it more in my head, because writing and typing was really a challenge this week. Last night I started to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200801\">\u2013 I had a good night last night writing-wise. So I was actually able to write down stuff. But when I wasn\u2019t writing, I was being very thorough in my head this week about, I was reading a lot, I read the disputing section in the REBT book, I read a lot actually. I\u2019d say I read about \u2013 different sections <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200802\">that I focused on, and one being, you know, the disputing, and how to get a little bit deeper into that, and also just some of the irrational beliefs that we sort of \u2013 we meaning as humans, like us \u2013 tend to kind of just come up with on our own terms. And so I was looking a little bit at that and really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200803\">relating to some of the irrational beliefs that, sort of in my mind, before all of this, were set in stone. And not realizing that <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20081\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20082\">THERAPIST: You mean you thought they were set in stone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20083\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20084\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20085\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20086\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re not really, are they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20087\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20088\">CLIENT: Right, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, that I thought that they were, and that they\u2019re not. So with that said, I actually had a real activating event, like something that actually \u2013 after all week of really using it in my mind, I had an actual even that I was able to record because it is sort of representative <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200881\">of like, I want to call it a life theme, I guess. It\u2019s something that from when I was little, that happened quite often, and so it \u2013 but I tried to put it into one incident, because one incident, or activating event, actually occurred yesterday. And so I found that my homework was very easy to do, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200882\">I had been thinking, thinking, thinking, and knowing the concepts, over the week, the homework became a lot \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say easy, but it was easier. The disputing piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20087-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20089\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008C\">THERAPIST: Remember a few sessions ago, when you were saying you find the disputing really hard, and a few times you would say \u201cThis is new to me, and this is hard\u201d. And certainly it appears to me that you\u2019re feeling more at ease with the process and more embracing of it, would that be correct?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E\">CLIENT: I agree, though I also have to add something in, I don\u2019t know if this is just me being, about my experience throughout all of this. Physically I find that when I\u2019m in a lot of physical pain, it does make it really really hard, all I can think about is just the pain, and so when I go to dispute, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E1\">I feel emotionally, I feel so \u2013 I feel angry, I feel drained, I feel frustrated, I feel just overwhelmed with pain. I mean the pain level is so intolerable at times that it\u2019s harder to dispute, has been my experience, and that if I\u2019m feeling like when I was able to write last night, and it was a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E2\">easier I find it easier. So I found a connection between those two things. That physically \u2013 for me, I don\u2019t know if everybody would experience it that way \u2013 but for me I found that it\u2019s a lot easier to do when I\u2019m not in as dire pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20091\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20092\">THERAPIST: Oh, I think most humans would have that experience. At the very least, being in pain is distracting. It can make the brain somewhat cloudy and foggy and so it\u2019s certainly very understandable. Having said that, I would also encourage you, if not at the exact time of intense pain, as soon after <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200921\">you have felt it as you feel comfortable enough to do so, to do ABC\u2019s on the anger and frustration that you feel as a result of the pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20093\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20094\">CLIENT: As a result of the pain, but not when you\u2019re in that immediate intense pain-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20095\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20096\">THERAPIST: If you can, fine, but if the reality is that you are feeling temporarily debilitated then rest, take a breath, have a cup of herbal tea, play with your cats, whatever, and when you feel somewhat calmer and able, then do the ABC\u2019s on what you were telling yourself to create the anger. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200961\">sometimes it\u2019s anger about the anger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20097\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20099\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009A\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C\">THERAPIST: Which is called a secondary disturbance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009E\">CLIENT: I read that. Anxiety about anxiety. You get anxiety about the fact that you have anxiety. It\u2019s like \u201cI have anxiety, now I\u2019m mad that I have anxiety\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A0\">THERAPIST: Or anger\u2026telling yourself: \u201cI\u2019m a counselor, and I\u2019ve been having six sessions, and I\u2019m still not able to do the \u2013 \u201c. And so, the first step then, would be to hone in on what you are telling yourself, and make strong effort at practicing greater USA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A1\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A3\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A4\">[TOGETHER] Unconditional Self-Acceptance (USA).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A6\">THERAPIST: Which is reminding yourself: \u201cI\u2019m a fallible human, and when I\u2019m in pain, I find it more difficult. Does that make me not good enough? No! Does that make me inferior? No! It means I\u2019m feeling pain and I\u2019m not applying myself to tasks as well as I prefer to, and as well as I wish I was at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A61\">this time\u201d. And so a first step is to attend to the secondary disturbed emotion of anger about the anger, or guilt about the guilt, and then you come back to the original or primary disturbing emotion about whatever it is. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A5-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A7\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A8\">CLIENT: It does.

Relationship, where \u2013 I\u2019m trying to say this in the REBT way, where it\u2019s \u2013 well it\u2019s my feeling that I \u2013 it\u2019s a feeling that I need her approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B7\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B8\">THERAPIST: You think you need -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B9\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BA\">CLIENT: I think that I need her approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BB\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BC\">THERAPIST: You think you need it. That\u2019s a belief. The good news is you can change it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BD\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BE\">CLIENT: Right, so my belief is that I think that I need her approval, and that without her approval \u2026we\u2019ll get into the beliefs. Or maybe I\u2019ll just say them now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BF\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C0\">THERAPIST: How about you start with A.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C1\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C2\">CLIENT: So the activating event was that earlier in the day, yesterday was Sunday and my mom had called to just catch up or whatever, and something came up about a holiday dinner that we had had, where wine had spilled all over \u2013 red wine had spilled all over the chair, and a little bit on the table, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C21\">chair, and on the carpet <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C3\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C4\">THERAPIST: You spilled it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C5\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C6\">CLIENT: No, it wasn\u2019t me. It was a friend that was there for dinner. So my friends were at the holiday dinner as well, and they still kind of laugh about that night, because they said that there was conversation, and there was laughter, and all these things, and then the wine spilled, and then thirty <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C61\">minutes of basically, like, silence, it was like somebody had died. My father was on the floor, he was taking Carbona, my mother was like, standing up, she was like, running, I mean it was like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C7\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C8\">THERAPIST: Jessa, can you see the funny side of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C9\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CA\">CLIENT: I did, and I was really trying that night, but that\u2019s like a very common thing, but they don\u2019t \u2013 the thing is they don\u2019t see they don\u2019t know, my parents don\u2019t realize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CB\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CC\">THERAPIST: Answer please Do you, now, see the funny side of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CD\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CE\">[00:25: 04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CF\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D0\">CLIENT: I mean, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D1\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D2\">THERAPIST: You sound hesitant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D3\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D4\">CLIENT: Because when I\u2019m in it, I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D5\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D6\">THERAPIST: Well I asked you about now -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D7\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D8\">CLIENT: Now I do. Oh, I think it\u2019s hilarious. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D9\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DA\">THERAPIST: Couldn\u2019t you see it as a sitcom on TV?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DB\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DC\">CLIENT: Yes, I think my family should have been on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DD\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DE\">THERAPIST: People would be crying with laughter, because people would identify -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DF\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E0\">CLIENT: They would identify with it, exactly -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E1\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E2\">THERAPIST: with crazy family scenarios.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E3\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E4\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E5\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E6\">THERAPIST: So when you\u2019re detached from it, like right now-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E7\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E8\">CLIENT: Oh it is, it\u2019s very funny. It is. It\u2019s definitely funny. But again, at the time, it was pretty intense, the situation, so what happened was, I actually brought the story up of what had happened because my friends \u2013 people were e-mailing, \u201coh, at the \u201cJones\u2019s\u201d, this is what happened\u201d and blah <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E81\">blah blah. You know, the red wine, and they were kind of just making it light and funny, because they know, people know my family, and they just know how high-strung they can be, and very neat and clean. Anyway. The point is that the story came up and it hadn\u2019t really <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E7-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E9\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EA\">THERAPIST: The story came up in your conversation with your mother yesterday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EB\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EC\">CLIENT: In my conversation with my mother. Right. And so I made a suggestion, when the conversation had come up, that maybe the next time that she has guests, that, because it was an upsetting situation to her and to my father, that maybe next time they put plastic down. So I said, \u201cYou might want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EC1\">consider that.\u201d So that this way, if somebody comes, they don\u2019t have to feel if they did spill, they don\u2019t have to feel badly. Because what ended up happening was, my parents\u2019 good friend, the one who did spill the wine, she kept saying \u201cI feel so bad, I feel so bad\u201d. And that lasted, like, for thirty <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EC2\">minutes, and then it went into the next day, and then she was e-mailing them, because she herself was damning herself for doing what she did. So it really became this big blown-up thing and I said \u201cWell, maybe the next time you just want to put down plastic.\u201d That\u2019s all I said. Well, my mother called <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EC3\">me back, like, but then she was annoyed with me. She didn\u2019t say why. She just kind of got quiet on the phone, and she sometimes will do that, and we hung up the phone, and, but I knew that she was bothered by something. And so whenever \u2013 that\u2019s not the first time that that\u2019s happened, and I tend to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EC4\">start getting all these thoughts in my head: my mother\u2019s bothered by something, and so I was kind of going, you know, ruminating a little bit, but then I <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200ED\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EE\">THERAPIST: Can I just stop and say that I hear progress the fact that you\u2019re thinking \u201cmy mother\u2019s bothered by something\u201d, instead of thinking \u201cI made my mother feel that way\u201d \u2013 that is progress!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EF\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F0\">CLIENT: Yes and I didn\u2019t think about that until just now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F1\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F2\">THERAPIST: Think about it.

And you didn\u2019t use that language just now. Just now here with me you didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FB\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FD\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FE\">CLIENT: Just now with you I didn\u2019t, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FF\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20100\">THERAPIST: I can tell, you just pointed to your notes and also by your facial expression there is something coming -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20101\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20102\">CLIENT: We\u2019ll get there. Something\u2019s coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20103\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20104\">THERAPIST: But it is beneficial to acknowledge, what you expressed right now, talking to me, can you see your progress?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20105\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20106\">CLIENT: I do. I \u2013 yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20107\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20108\">THERAPIST: Evidence of progress in the way you speak \u2013 and think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20109\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010A\">CLIENT: In the way I just believe it. Exactly. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010B\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010C\">THERAPIST: I want to acknowledge that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010D\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010E\">CLIENT: Well thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010F\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20110\">THERAPIST: And I also want to acknowledge that when I tell you positive things, you say thank you. The first week we worked together, it seemed really hard for you to accept anything positive I said. So I just wanted to point out this other progress that I\u2019m seeing after only six sessions, and you doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201101\">work in between. Well, well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20111\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20113\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20114\">CLIENT: Thank you, Debbie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20115\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20116\">THERAPIST: So. Back to the drama -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20117\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20118\">CLIENT: Back to the melodrama with the family, yeah. So she called like\u2013 so that happened, and then she called back, probably about two hours later. And I also want to just preface this with saying that this is something, this sort of back and forth, with calling and being upset \u2013 this happens a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20119\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20119-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011B\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011C\">THERAPIST: Could we call it somewhat obsessive behavior?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011D\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011E\">CLIENT: It is. Yeah. It\u2019s obsessive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011F\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20120\">THERAPIST: Okay. So notice that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20121\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20122\">CLIENT: Okay. Yes. I am very aware. That I was aware of for a long time. So anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20123\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20124\">THERAPIST: You can change that, you know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20125\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20126\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So my mom called back, and she said wait, hold on, hold on, I\u2019m reading my notes here. She said, \u201cI just want to tell you something\u201d, and I said \u201cyeah\u201d, and she said \u201cI was a little hurt, because you mentioned putting plastic down in case wine spilled the next time,\u201d she said. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201261\">\u201cAnd you made it out to seem as if we got quiet after the wine spilled, and that Daddy and I were \u201cand she said \u201cWe weren\u2019t quiet, we were fine about it, and everybody was talking and having a great time, and I felt that you were putting me down.\u201d She felt that I was putting her down by saying that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201262\">the next time that people come that maybe she puts plastic. She said \u201cI think it\u2019s disgusting to put plastic down, I think it\u2019s inappropriate, and you don\u2019t make your guests feel comfortable,\u201d and she went on to say that somebody that she \u2013 a friend\u2019s house that she went to did that once and that the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201263\">daughter was embarrassed and she feels that that\u2019s totally not \u2013 you know, the way that you invite guests to your house and blah blah blah. So anyway. That was the activating event, right? So I\u2019ll tell you what I did in a minute, but just so that you\u2019re aware of the consequences -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20127\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20129\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012A\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s what comes next \u2013 identify the Consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012B\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012C\">CLIENT: are that I was, what I wrote down is that I was anxious when she said -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012D\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012E\">THERAPIST: You felt anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012F\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20130\">CLIENT: I felt anxious when she said \u201cI just want to tell you something\u201d, because I\u2019ve heard that before, many times. And I felt guilty, like a bad girl, because whenever I hear \u201cI just want to tell you something,\u201d and it\u2019s in her tone, I know what\u2019s coming, and I\u2019ve heard it. So it\u2019s guilt, and anxiety, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201301\">and \u201cyou\u2019re a bad girl\u201d, telling myself that kind of stuff. And then the beliefs were, as she was speaking, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything\u201d, I caught myself, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t stand my mother being mad at me\u201d, \u201cI suck\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m the worst daughter\u201d, \u201cAny other daughter wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201302\">have even mentioned the plastic\u201d, \u201cShe will never approve of me\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m unlovable\u201d. I don\u2019t know if \u2013 you know, it sounds extreme, but, you know, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not even that I had those exact thoughts, it\u2019s the feeling that\u2019s kind of connected to the possible thoughts I\u2019m having that at this point, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201303\">didn\u2019t even realize that they were thoughts until I went to go write and do my homework. That was the thing. I didn\u2019t know, because to me it used to be, just to go back to when I was younger, it felt always chaotic. The feeling \u2013 everything got blended in so I didn\u2019t know. It was an over just sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201304\">of the over \u2013 okay then, this is what you think about yourself now, after that type of incident would happen. But again, it wasn\u2019t like, overnight, or one particular incident, it was over time. So I wasn\u2019t even aware until \u2013 so anyway, the good news is, the way I handled it was I said, I guess I handled <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201305\">it not even realizing, using REBT. The situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20131\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20132\">THERAPIST: Hold on. \u2018Handled it\u2019 you say, are you talking about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20133\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20134\">CLIENT: The situation with my mother on the phone. Should I go to that or continue with the dispute and all that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20135\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20136\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019ve started talking about this so let\u2019s finish this, and then I am most interested to -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20135-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20137\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20138\">CLIENT: To know what I actually did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20139\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013A\">THERAPIST: Yes. Have you any other irrational beliefs written down that you identified?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013B\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013C\">CLIENT: Isn\u2019t that enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013D\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013E\">THERAPIST: You got the juicy ones, sure you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013F\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20140\">CLIENT: Those are the juicy \u2013 I think probably I feel unlovable, the biggest is probably -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20141\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20142\">THERAPIST: Is it \u201cI feel unlovable\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20143\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20144\">CLIENT: Or I am unlovable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20145\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20147\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20148\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re two different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20149\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014A\">CLIENT: Okay I feel unlovable. Or I, no I said \u201cI am unlovable.\u201d That\u2019s what I wrote here. I don\u2019t remember now. Shall I say what it is now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014B\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014C\">THERAPIST: Say what what is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014D\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014E\">CLIENT: What the \u2013 what it would be at the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014F\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20150\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20151\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20152\">CLIENT: I think it was \u201cI am unlovable\u201d. Because it\u2019s not the first time that that incident \u2013 that something like that has occurred. So it\u2019s \u201cI am unlovable\u201d, because it\u2019s happened on more than one occasion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20153\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20154\">THERAPIST: And even if some people don\u2019t love you in some moments, that statement \u201cI am unlovable\u201d on its own wouldn\u2019t necessarily induce a disturbed emotion. It\u2019s probable that you\u2019re adding something to that, such as \u201cas I should be\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20155\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20156\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20157\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20159\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015A\">THERAPIST: Alright, so now \u201cCherchez le should\u201d. Cherchez le \u201cshould\u201d. The more precise we are in identifying the irrationality of a belief, the easier and clearer it becomes to dispute it. When you started describing the ABC of this situation, you said that just hearing your mother say \u201cI want to tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015A1\">you\u201d, you felt anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015B\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015C\">CLIENT: Yeah, panicky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015D\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015E\">THERAPIST: Panicky. So can you now identify probable irrational beliefs connected with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015F\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20160\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20161\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20162\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s hear them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20163\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20164\">CLIENT: Wait, I lost you. I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20165\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20166\">THERAPIST: So you felt panicky and anxious you said, as soon as your mother gave her familiar line of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20167\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20168\">CLIENT: Oh, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha. \u201cI just want to tell you something\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20169\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016A\">THERAPIST: Yes. So look at that \u201cI just want to tell you something\u201d. Now, many humans who hear \u201cI just want to tell you something\u201d don\u2019t feel panic or anxiety. So what are your thoughts when Mummy says that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016B\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016D\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016E\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s the tone, there\u2019s a tone to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016F\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20170\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a tone, and what do you tell yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20171\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20172\">CLIENT: Now I understand. So, I tell myself \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u201d. I immediately start with \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u201d. Whatever I did, I shouldn\u2019t have done. That\u2019s number one. That\u2019s actually the first, the go-to thought. \u201cJessa, you shouldn\u2019t have done what you did\u201d. That one I can tap into pretty quickly. But now <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201721\">I see what you\u2019re saying, to extrapolate with the \u201cI feel unlovable\u201d as I \u2013 but I shouldn\u2019t feel unlovable. I should feel loved by my mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20173\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20174\">THERAPIST: And perhaps you believe you should feel loved or approved by everyone. I mean in your life. It\u2019s been a theme in the past, your needing approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20175\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20176\">CLIENT: Right<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20177\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20178\">THERAPIST: In the past you shared about your waking up early in the morning, hoping you\u2019ve done the right thing, made the right choice, remember a session early on when we spoke about that? So this need for approval, this dire need for approval, and very pointedly from your parents, maybe more so from <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201781\">your mother, is going to keep you suffering if you don\u2019t continue the good work you\u2019re doing. So, any more irrational beliefs before you dispute the life out of these ones right here and now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20179\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017B\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017C\">CLIENT: Yeah.

See, it\u2019s always that ending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20185\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20186\">THERAPIST: Well it usually is that ending, if the result is anxiety, panic or other unpleasantries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20187\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20188\">CLIENT: Right. God. That part always gets me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20189\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018A\">THERAPIST: You mean, until now, that part has not been as evident as you\u2019d like it to be. You can\u2019t say it always gets you, because always implies always: past, present and future, and you still have years of life left.  [cross talk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018C\">THERAPIST: Remember, REBT procedures -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018D\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018E\">CLIENT: I feel like I\u2019ll come back next week and then \u2013 alright, so let me ask you this. How do I get that part? You say that part I find -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018F\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20190\">THERAPIST: Which part? You are jumping from one thing to another \u2013 focus Jessa \u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20191\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20192\">CLIENT: The part \u2013 in other words, I can. Okay, so can we just do an example. Let\u2019s do another example and I\u2019ll show you, in other words, I don\u2019t even think about that part. And that part, I guess is the practice -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20193\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20194\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t thought about it until now is a more accurate way of saying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20195\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20196\">CLIENT: It goes three, it goes two, it\u2019s like, the thought, and then there\u2019s the next piece of it, and then there\u2019s \u201cas I shouldn\u2019t be\u201d. So I have to just get that sort of in there. [laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20197\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20198\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20199\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019A\">THERAPIST: The probability of that comment being attached, do you understand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019C\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019D\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019E\">THERAPIST: If there\u2019s panic, anxiety, all those negative emotions -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019F\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A0\">CLIENT: Chances are that that\u2019s in there someplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A1\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A2\">THERAPIST: The chances are high that it may be. So, a new, heightened awareness of your thoughts, and greater precision in identifying the should and the musts, will help you. CLIENT: Okay, got it, got it. So are we on to the \u2013 so that was it on the irrational \u2013 I mean there are more, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A3\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A4\">THERAPIST: There may be, but let\u2019s dispute what you already identified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A5\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A6\">CLIENT: Okay. So the disputing was that this belief was not helpful, and probably not even true, the beliefs that I was mentioning earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A7\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A8\">THERAPIST: Can I suggest greater precision? Your saying \u201cProbably not even true\u201d, whilst not being inaccurate, may not be as powerful as being more direct and asking \u201cWhere is the evidence?\u201d Try to prove that it\u2019s true. And when you can\u2019t it proves to be more solid dispute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A9\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AB\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AC\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t know I was a lawyer now. No, I\u2019m just kidding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AD\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AE\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AF\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B0\">[laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B1\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B2\">THERAPIST: But, if you look in the REBT book under the disputing section, there are three main forms of disputing, and one says \u201cWhere is the evidence?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B3\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B4\">CLIENT: I looked, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B5\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B6\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s the pragmatic, there\u2019s the logical, there\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B7\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B8\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B9\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BA\">THERAPIST: Where is the evidence? In your instance...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BB\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BC\">CLIENT: Okay. So, it\u2019s my mother \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this part is disputing, but I basically said it\u2019s my mother\u2019s irrational belief, it\u2019s not mine, about her thinking that what I was saying was offensive, basically. In other words, that I could accept what she said, which is ultimately what I did, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BC1\">just say I\u2019m sorry that you feel that way, but that\u2019s not even all what my point was. I was taking more preventative measures, and I was being serious by saying if you put plastic down, it really might, you know, prevent some further people, you know, incidents, or people getting frustrated or upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BC2\">over wine spilling.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201BB-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BD\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BE\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BF\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C0\">THERAPIST(jokes): Or just serve vodka, which has no color.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C1\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C2\">CLIENT: Yeah, or just serve vodka. (Laughs). So I looked at it as I was being preventative, so in other words, instead of taking it on \u2013 putting it on me, this is me disputing it right now, instead of putting it back on me that I did something wrong, or that I was bad or that I shouldn\u2019t have said what <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C21\">I said, I was just expressing a \u2013 I was just giving another way of trying to look at the situation to prevent more dysfunction in that house, because I have to go there for the holidays. [laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C3\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C4\">THERAPIST: Good. That will be a great opportunity, a great opportunity to practice REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C5\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C6\">CLIENT: Thanksgiving. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C7\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C8\">THERAPIST: What you just did was hone in on the point that you are not responsible for how your mother feels. You are only responsible for your own thoughts and therefore the feelings you create within YOU as a result. So as part of the disputing, again, what\u2019s helpful is clarity and precision. So to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C81\">attack an irrational belief like \u201cI can\u2019t stand making my mother upset\u201d, the dispute could be \u201cWhere is the evidence? -there is no evidence for my should. I was in truth only giving my opinion, and even if I had said something intentionally critical, she creates her own emotions by the way she interprets <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C82\">what I say. I am not responsible for that\u201d. Do you see what I mean? So more directly, you see, when you give a more general statement, that belongs more in the E, in the Effective New Philosophies. Disputing is disputing. It involves questioning. One takes an idea and cuts it down. With logic, with <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C83\">pragmatism, seeking evidence, socratically. Makes sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C9\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CB\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CC\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CD\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CE\">THERAPIST: So what other disputing, if any, did you do on that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CF\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D0\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just said, it\u2019s not logical, those thoughts aren\u2019t really logical. And then I just said it\u2019s not really logical, it\u2019s not in reality to \u2013 in other words, what I was really thinking, and I didn\u2019t write it down, was that, I don\u2019t think that my mother \u2013 she didn\u2019t actually come out and <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D01\">say, \u201cI don\u2019t love you, you\u2019re a terrible daughter\u201d. I interpreted it that way, based on just a mere feeling that, almost like association, that I got because of her upset. That if I upset her, or if she says, \u201cYou upset me in a certain way\u201d, then I immediately just jump to \u201cI did this X, Y, and Z, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D02\">and I shouldn\u2019t have done X, Y, and Z\u201d, when in reality, I said what I said, and it didn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t change \u2013 the statement is out there, so it doesn\u2019t make me unlovable or not the best daughter just because she didn\u2019t like what I had to say or didn\u2019t, or \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I feel like I know what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D03\">trying to say but it\u2019s not coming out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D1\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D2\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s why it\u2019s beneficial to write with greater precision and directness, you know, write down the irrational belief and dispute that directly, otherwise it can seem a little more fuzzy and you can go from this to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D3\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D4\">CLIENT: Maybe I had a harder time with the disputing than I thought. I guess I just thought because of the way I handled it on the actual telephone call, that I felt that maybe on a very underlying level that I got the concepts without \u2013 in a sense, maybe not as much as, that I would like to at this <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D41\">point, but that I got it because I didn\u2019t take it in as much as I typically do, in fact I just said that to me I could hear the irrational belief in what she was saying. I was able to pinpoint that she sounded irrational by saying that it upset her so much, because I said that that wasn\u2019t the point <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D42\">of what I was trying to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201D3-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D5\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D6\">THERAPIST: So at some point, you took it less personally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D7\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D8\">CLIENT: I took it less personally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D9\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DA\">THERAPIST: At some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DB\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DC\">CLIENT: At some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DD\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DE\">THERAPIST: Now, initially you told me you felt panic and anxiety. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DF\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E0\">CLIENT: Initially, and then I calmed down, I didn\u2019t answer her right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E1\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E2\">THERAPIST: Okay, so the proof is in the pudding, you\u2019re already seeing evidence that you\u2019re thinking somewhat differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E3\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E4\">CLIENT: It\u2019s somewhat differently, yeah.

Because I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201F41\">many thoughts throughout the day, and sometimes I don\u2019t think I\u2019m thinking at all, I think I just kind of want to move along, but there really are thoughts.

My question is, maybe it would be easier for me to decipher when I do have a thought, how <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201FE1\">do I even know if it\u2019s irrational or not? I think that might be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FF\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20200\">THERAPIST: Can you try now to answer that question?

You know, I didn\u2019t write it, but I was catching it when I thought it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020F\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20210\">THERAPIST: Albert Ellis used to frequently say that many species of animals think, but as far as we know, humans, in all probability, are the only species who can think about their thinking who can be aware, if we so choose. We humans can watch our thoughts and recognize, \u201cAh, look at what I\u2019m telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202101\">myself.\u201d We can choose to go into that camera part of the mind, looking upon what we\u2019re telling ourselves. And so that is key, to choose to be mindful and more aware, to let debilitating emotions be a cue to amplify that awareness, and then to do what you just said you did \u2013 look for the demands. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202102\">answered your question, very well. \u201cCherchez le should\u201d. Look for the should, the must, the ought.

And the embarrassment in front of the class; I think for her, that was the bigger consequence. I\u2019m only using her as an example because I relate to her, so sometimes when you can\u2019t see your own, when you can\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing yourself, you can sometimes have your clientele <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2021E1\">reflect back on you a little bit, and I think I would have maybe acted similarly to her, I was the same, similar type of student, and if I had done something like that I probably would have had some similar feelings to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021F\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20220\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20221\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20222\">THERAPIST: So again, look at how you\u2019re thinking differently than you did some weeks ago.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2024B\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2024C\">THERAPIST: The area is unconditional self-acceptance. You\u2019re choosing her to be the gauge of your acceptability according to how much she loves you or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2024D\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2024E\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2024F\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20250\">THERAPIST: Okay.

And your work, that I suggest, is to continue to make effort to convince yourself of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20255\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20256\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m very aware of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20257\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20258\">THERAPIST: So with that awareness, what are you going to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20259\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2025A\">CLIENT: Just continue to dispute any of the irrational beliefs I have around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2025B\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2025C\">THERAPIST: And I would also suggest reminding yourself, the effective new philosophy \u201cI\u2019m worthwhile, even if my parents don\u2019t approve of me. I\u2019m a fallible human; even if I talk without tact sometimes, it doesn\u2019t make me damnable, it makes me a human who spoke her mind. I would like the approval and <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2025C1\">adoration of my parents, and even if I don\u2019t have it, or don\u2019t have it as much as I wish I did, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have worth, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t stand it, it doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t find love from other people, and more importantly, I\u2019m continuing to work on accepting myself unconditionally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2025C2\">as a fallible human of worth. Whether I do good or do bad actions.\u201d Make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2025D\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2025E\">CLIENT: Mmm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2025F\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20260\">THERAPIST: And so using those effective new philosophies, remembering them through the day, like affirmations, can be preventatives. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20261\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20262\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20263\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20264\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking?

It wasn\u2019t like I was then down for the rest of the day, but it was like, there, kind of lingering, but it wasn\u2019t like I couldn\u2019t get out of bed after that <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202722\">or something like that. It was there and I don\u2019t think I realized how much it was, until I went to write it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20273\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20274\">THERAPIST: And in all probability, if you were not to attend to it preventatively by applying the ABC\u2019s, with giving it thought, the next time your mother says, \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to tell you,\u201d you\u2019re more likely to more quickly go into panic and anxiety, than if you have done your ABC\u2019s on this <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202741\">issue before, and you may be able to prevent the anxiety, nip it in the bud, as soon as the \u201cshould\u2019\u2019 is rearing itself up, thinking something like: \u201cSo my mother\u2019s going to do her same old thing, I can stand it.\u201d Another thing I strongly recommend is not to take her so seriously.

Oh my goodness. What did I say? So, no, I basically just, I listened, after she said \u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d instead of reacting, I kind of just calmed down, and just listened, and let her express, and just said \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt that way, but that\u2019s not at all, you know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202841\">I was really only saying it because I was trying to be preventative with, you know, using preventative measures so that for the next event, you know, I said \u2013 oh, I know what I said, I know what I said.

I want to say always, because that\u2019s whenever she says \u201cI have to tell you something\u201d, she\u2019ll say, \u201cYou made me feel\u201d, blah blah blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20295\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20296\">THERAPIST: So what\u2019s your work whenever she does that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20297\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20298\">CLIENT: Tell myself that I didn\u2019t make her feel that way, or I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20299\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2029A\">THERAPIST: Exactly.

So yeah, so I just said \u2013 but then I related to her, because really, instead of looking at it in a sense that my parents are neurotic or obsessive-compulsive or whatever they are, I like my things a certain way, too, so I said, I was really saying it because I can completely understand. <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202A01\">I said, if I was having people over, I\u2019d have plastic. So I said, because I like my apartment really nice. And then she was crapping up on the whole thing. And so I sort of \u2013 but that was a newer thing for me, because lots of times I can just get really defensive. And so instead, I just sort of \u2013 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202A02\">don\u2019t want to say I, you know \u2013 it wasn\u2019t that I side with her, it was that I really just understood from her perspective what she may have felt when the wine did spill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202A1\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202A2\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s sounds like you are moving in the direction of unconditional other acceptance and having empathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202A3\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202A4\">CLIENT: I was just empathizing, because I know if red wine spilled on my carpet, I\u2019d be upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202A5\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202A6\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d upset yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202A7\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202A8\">CLIENT: Oh, yes, I\u2019d upset myself.

And now you\u2019ve told me for the first two months, no, and by the way, have there not been some hours or minutes since then when you have been lighthearted?

I can\u2019t lie about it. It\u2019s there, you know, so and then of course, she said, \u201cWell, I love you regardless of your physical ailments\u201d, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E9\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202EA\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s called unconditional other acceptance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EB\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202EC\">CLIENT: Right, so she accepts me unconditionally, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202ED\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202EE\">THERAPIST: Let her be a model to you of how you can be towards yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EF\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202F0\">CLIENT: She helps me a lot.

That\u2019s why I used that as an example just now, is that when my boss basically said \u201cYou look like you\u2019re in pain,\u201d you know, my typical, in the past, would have been \u201cNo, I\u2019m good, everything\u2019s great, you know, I\u2019m fine\u201d and I didn\u2019t do that today, and I think the look was of, \u201cWow\u201d, <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203041\">like, you know, \u201cYou just admitted that\u201d. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20305\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20306\">THERAPIST: And you felt comfortable after that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20307\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20308\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20309\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2030A\">THERAPIST: Good. Good, more progress. Well done. [ringtone] So there\u2019s the telephone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2030B\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2030C\">CLIENT: Sorry, I\u2019ll just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2030D\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2030E\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay. Alright, well, as I mentioned earlier, next week I\u2019ll be out of town at a conference, so we\u2019ll meet in two weeks, but let me ask what homework do you think would be beneficial for you over this extra period of time, between you and I meeting now, and meeting again in 2 weeks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2030F\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20310\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe the unconditional \u2013 maybe something with the unconditional self-acceptance part? If you could create an assignment for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20311\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20312\">THERAPIST: I certainly can. What I\u2019ll invite you to do is to write down any and all beliefs that you can think of where you\u2019re not unconditionally accepting yourself. The \u201cI should\u2019s, the \u201cI need to \u2026. or else\u201d. And to vigorously dispute them. And to come up with a list of effective new philosophies <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203121\">that are -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20313\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20314\">CLIENT: Can I just get the pen? Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20315\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20316\">CLIENT: Okay, so basically devise, or come up with -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20317\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20318\">THERAPIST: Identify, not devise. Don\u2019t think of any that have \u2013 well you can if you want, but certainly the ones that have lived in freedom and unchallenged within you until now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20319\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031A\">CLIENT: Identify where I\u2019m not using USA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031B\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031C\">THERAPIST: Right. So the \u201cshould\u201d you have about yourself. The lack of approval you have about yourself, and when. Give examples. Identify your irrational beliefs about you in that regard, and dispute, dispute, dispute. Re-read the section on disputing, so that you dispute more thoroughly than you might <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N2031C1\">have done in the past. And then come up with your effective new philosophies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031D\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031E\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s devise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031F\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20320\">THERAPIST: Well\u2013 creating the \u201cE\u201d \u2013 effective new philosophies often comes as an easy flow following the disputing in most places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20321\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20322\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20323\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20324\">CLIENT: Well I\u2019m looking at it as devising, because I\u2019ve never done it before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20325\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20326\">THERAPIST: Well, you may have done it, but just not identified it the same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20327\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20328\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t identified -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20329\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2032A\">THERAPIST: And then write a list of your effective new philosophies on a separate page. \u201cI approve of myself, and though I\u2019d like the approval of others, I don\u2019t need it. I can still have a quality life even if my mother thinks I\u2019m inadequate in 89% of the aspects of my being.\u201d Whatever it is, a list <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N2032A1\">of the effective new philosophies and read them every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P18-N20329-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"17\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20329-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":19,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561792\" data-realpage=\"19\" data-page=\"19\">\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2032B\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2032C\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2032D\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2032E\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2032F\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20330\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s honing in and noticing any lack of unconditional self-acceptance with a goal of you developing more of that, more more more, and being more aware of the tendency not to USA yourself so that you work hard to change that. In addition to that homework, I\u2019d like to suggest that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N203301\">do some full ABCDE forms. ABCDE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20331\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20332\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20333\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20334\">THERAPIST: Okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20335\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20336\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20337\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20338\">THERAPIST: Do you want to write that down, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20339\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033A\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2033B\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033C\">THERAPIST: You have a few weeks, minus a session.
