I did go and get tea for a couple of hours (inaudible at 0:00:20) very good (inaudible at 0:00:27). Yeah, I think most of it... I think most of my feeling, like, other people won't be okay with that comes from me rather than other people. I think most of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">the other people that I know, if they don't themselves feel a need to hide from people after a couple of days, they definitely understand that I do (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So... [0:00:56] (Pause) Yeah. I'm still not exactly sure how work's going to go today. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: How work's going to go today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: In some regards, James's parents and my family are really similar, as in, we spent at least an hour yesterday trying to decide where to go to dinner. [0:02:06] And it was hard because it's Monday, and places are closed on Monday. But, this is Andover, they have lots of restaurants! (Chuckling) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">Not all of them are closed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And there was just... I don't know, [they were just wanting to] (ph)... they spent a lot of time on (inaudible at 0:2:31) and online, trying to find good places. And we sort of listed all the places that we've been to, and, since nobody else was expressing an opinion, I said, you know what? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">I like the Ethiopian place. Let's try that. But my in-laws are not Ethiopian food people, in some ways? It was a novel... it was new for them to be like, let's eat food with your hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. [0:03:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: And I think they liked it okay, but they wouldn't have gone on their own. And... (Pause) Yeah, so even after I made the suggestion, they go, yeah, okay, that would be nice, and then continued to look for other options, which is fine. But after that I was just like, well, I'm going to go do something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">else until you figure it out (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I feel like I had more to say about what we were talking about yesterday, but I can't remember what that is now. [0:03:59] (Pause) But of course, as soon as it became clear that we were going to eat at the place I had suggested, I started to panic and feel guilty about that. [0:05:02] But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">don't think I inflicted that on anybody else much, (inaudible at 0:5:12). (Pause) [0:05:59] I'm not... (Pause) So on the one hand I feel like I've had... there's been so much for pressure for me to... or from myself for me to have this job work and have moving to meeting with you three times a week <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">work and to be okay in the fact of that. And I feel like the ways that I've tried to keep everything okay, I'm not sure that they're that helpful? But I don't know what else to do. And in some ways I feel like, maybe it's not that they're not helpful. Maybe it's just there's not anything that's going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">to be that helpful in making changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yes, uh-huh. [0:07:00] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I ran into... (chuckling) this weekend I ran into two people I knew, just walking down the street, which is two more than happens almost ever. I just never see people I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: But... so both times I was out with James and his parents. Yesterday I ran into a guy from church, who serves as a Eucharistic minister with me. [0:08:00] And when we were at... we went to the museum, and when we were there I ran into Marla Jones, who was a woman who was at Williamd &amp; Mary with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">me and is now...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559788\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: A former roommate's roommate, Kirsten's (sp?) roommate...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Both of which are just weird, Marla possibly more so. (Pause) Sort of throws me. I don't like it (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause) [0:09:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I'm sort of having a hard time talking today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I'm anxious about going to work. (Pause) [0:10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: And you might have (inaudible at 0:10:25). Clearly an example with deciding where to go to dinner, I had an impression that you were worried you were going to spend the whole hour here trying to figure out what to talk about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) And then in the same way you impose what you wanted on them. You were going to... you were worried about what you were going to impose on me when you picked something to talk about. And then [what you felt] (ph) you didn't do then, you worried about... you were going to feel guilty <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">about imposing that? [0:11:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:11:06). (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like a lot of days I sort of talk around things for a while. But... I don't know how not to. (Pause) [0:12:00] It's like I... (Pause) It's like I sort of talk and talk and talk, trying to avoid distressing things, until not feeling... feeling I don't know what to talk about becomes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">distressing enough. I'm like, wow, I'm already there, so (laughing)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Right. Again, kind of like you said a few minutes ago about being determined to make [me and] (ph) your schedule work, sort of trying to do all these things...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: [Which in the end] (ph) make you much less distressed, I guess?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I can't know... (Pause) [0:13:01] I don't know what it would be like if I didn't try to manage everything, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:14:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: And I guess it comes back again to, in a sort of smaller way, feeling like I won't be able to recover myself. [I don't know] (ph), I'm just very much thinking, well, after this I have to walk to my car and drive to work and then take care of kids all day and (pause), despite all evidence to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">the contrary-or a fair amount of evidence to the contrary-feeling like I won't be able to do that if I talk about things that matter here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I see. Uh-huh. [0:14:59] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: [Feeling like I have to] (ph) keep all the things that are distressing to me split off and out of sight, because there's no possible way I could function if they were not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause) [0:16:00] And I think it's a lot because of... that you're afraid [what it] (ph) will most immediately do to someone else, like me, and then sort of, as kind of an immediate consequence, to you for feeling like you've done that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: That you will impose or you will have done something that makes me kind of push back or not hear it or misunderstand it.

(Pause) [0:18:00] I think I'm more worried right now that I'll disappoint you in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559788\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Not a big worry, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: In terms of things I worry about with you, that's kind of at the top.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) [0:19:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, it feels like the things I need to do and be in here in order not to disappoint you and the things I need to do and be at work in order not to disappoint there are contradictory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) [0:20:00] Which I guess includes the idea that I think you really ought to talk about (inaudible at 0:20:31) kinds of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I keep [weighing them out] (ph), which is, I recognize, not the same thing as thinking I need to talk about what I should talk about. [0:20:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: But I... (Pause) But I think also there's a lot of... (Pause) It's hard for me to talk about these things. It's hard for me to admit that I want to talk about these things. So here you are conveniently suggesting that (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess it seems to me that, at least now, you're kind of hearing what I said yesterday about some of the things that you were afraid of not seeming to line up with how things had gone in the past...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: As part of an argument then that you will be okay talking about these things. Or there's a kind of implication that you should. [0:21:57] I guess in a way there was an argument that it seems plausible that you will be more okay than you think talking about difficult things. But it also... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">I have the impression that it felt like there was some pressure there from the in-laws. So you should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: [It must be okay] (ph) (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.

(Pause) [0:30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Well, you know this, but I just wanted to say anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Just because I was arguing with you yesterday doesn't mean I wasn't listening to what you said. It doesn't mean that didn't help. It's just... (Pause) Yeah, I guess... (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) [0:31:00] One of the women that I prayed with at church this week...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Asked me to pray with her for relief from fear, that she [had a lot of fear] (ph). (Pause) [0:32:00] So it's sort of... well, I'm not sure if this is actually like this, but this is the next thing my mind goes to. So we're walking with my in-laws, and we see Smart Cars kind of parked out and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">around. And they think they're absolutely ridiculous and say, they're like clown cars. And yes, they are like clown cars. But the main point... the main thing they'd say, being like, you should never take those on the highway. Oh no. They're just too dangerous for the highway. [0:33:00] And so I kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B72\">of keep my mouth shut. And then last night they both kind of pushed me and said, you'd take them on the highway? I don't know. I think, if a tractor-trailer hits you, you will be just as dead in a regular-size car as in one of those cars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: I don't think... I don't buy the bigger is safer thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: So maybe I guess... (Pause) Maybe one way of sort of thinking about what we were talking about yesterday is to... I don't feel like you were saying... (Pause) [0:34:06] You... I feel like you were saying that, maybe... telling me that the times I've been in the hospital comes from some place, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">comes from a specific trigger and... or it has in the past, and sort of saying, you can still be safe. You will be more safe than you think you are to talk about these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: When I feel like, for me, the kind of... the challenge is not figuring out how to be safer or recognizing that I will be safer, but recognizing that I won't ever actually be safe and being okay with that. [0:35:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: So, with the cars, the issue is to be okay with riding in a deathtrap no matter what you're behind the wheel of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Rather than to try to avoid Smart Cars because those are dangerous on the highway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah, I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: [I like that] (ph), yeah. (Pause) [0:36:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: So (pause) it is (pause) helpful for me to remember that... I've always [felt like] (ph) my moods don't come out of nowhere and just go into nowhere. [0:37:03] They're not inexplicable. And that helps, but in some sense it's not... yeah, it doesn't quite address what I'm, I think, worrying about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">most, which is, they're there. And I can't... (Pause) That in some sense figuring out how to protect myself has to start with me knowing that I'm not ever going to be able to protect myself enough. [0:37:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: (Teary) And I don't know how to do that. (Pause) [0:39:00] I'm not sure that's where I started out, thinking about this.
