Marathon today? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I have a sort of friend who's running in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Did you think I would be watching it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Well you said last time something. You said you run, or something, so ... It's cold today (inaudible) for everyone I suppose. How long do they run for, like is it according to miles or ... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: A marathon is, excuse me, always the same mileage no matter where it is, it's the same distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Oh, OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It refers to a very specific distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh, OK. So like 100 miles or like 50 miles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: 26.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: 26. I didn't know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: 26.2.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So is it like the people in their, they come first and second and third and they do that or ...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they do that, the top finishers. They usually are, you know, professional runners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. How long does it take to run like 25 miles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It depends on how fast you run. They range.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, big range. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Sure. They have heats, and when they do it, the elite men under 210.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Two hours and ten minutes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: There's a huge range.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: 26 miles, I would walk last. The most I can do is three. Can you walk? Do people start walking if they get tired?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Some people do, sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: I think I'm too lazy to prepare for something like that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">How do you prepare for a run, like do you run like every day, like five, six, 10 miles? (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: It depends. Usually you run a certain amount during the week and then you run a long run on the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Long as in like 26 miles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Depends on, no, you don't usually run that whole distance. Most people like run like 22. It depends on where, if you can only run 3 miles, you start off your long run as three miles, and the next week it's four miles, the next week it's five miles. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">It depends on where you are. Even couch potatoes can run a marathon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: They just get off the couch and start running?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: There was a documentary two years ago. They took like 12 couch potatoes, and 11 of them finished the marathon, including a 60-something-year-old woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Wow. But what kind of training did that have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: They had a lot of, you know, many months, many, many months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Many months. A-ha. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: (inaudible). Usually people train if they're in good shape, for four months. But if you're not in good shape, like eight months. Does that sound like a long time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think (inaudible) little time, for like, you know, like the week ahead and even then, I realize, \"Oh, I'm so old, I can't just (inaudible). I cannot do all that I planned for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you plan for too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: Well, you know, I'm realistic. The thing I do, I say, \"Oh yeah, I'm going to sit here for eight hours and finish this thing.\" You know, like this past week I was really stressed. I didn't know what to do. I thought I'd finish that piece that turned into that magazine, and still in shambles and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D1\">so still this week I'm hoping to work on my project, and I haven't worked on it in like 15 days, and that's making me very cranky and purposeless. (chuckle). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559528\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">I'm disoriented and insecure and confused (chuckle). And I was like, \"Oh, okay, you can do it the next whole month. Every day I'm going to work on the project,\" but it's obviously not going to happen even starting out today I know it's not going to happen, so it makes me sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Why is it not going to happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Well today I have to finish the piece, so I'm thinking, maybe I should be easier on myself and be a little realistic and make more specific goals, like plan more specifically rather than just saying, \"Oh, I'll work on this part instead.\" I can say, \"No, I look at this theme and see how it can, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">you know.\" Maybe that will help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">Be more specific in my planning and I've been stressing and I gained like two pounds (chuckle) in like two days (chuckle).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Do you binge eat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. Totally. I abuse food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: When do you binge eat, at night? Throughout the day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, throughout the day. I just like, I cannot I get really anxious so put whatever's out there in my mouth (chuckle).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: How does that help?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: I don't know, something to do. It distracts me. The taste of the food just kind of, you know, it's gratification. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">But it's not, because I feel like feel yucky, you know? So I'm going to start, I'm going to watch what I put in my mouth (chuckle) and when I'm really like nervous and on edge, I just eat. Instead I could, I don't know, chew gum. (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">Advice? I'm kind of like feeling weird about this (inaudible), like preparing for the marathon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">And participating. She and I are like a a group, clique, this women's initiative we just started, and she's always like she's so bossy, and at first I thought this was great, you know, we're a new group, I will meet someone, use initiative, and who can organize and send all the e-mails, but you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">know, this past week I was so busy, and she just kept sending me e-mails, \"do this, do that.\" And then, you know, called me up, and like, \"are you coming to this vigil?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">And I was I had like three other events to go to on Saturday. I made a mess of them all, I was at a thesis reading, and I stepped out to go to the stupid vigil, and then I couldn't go back, well it wasn't a stupid vigil, but I'm choosing merrily running a marathon, well it's not merrily, it's very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">hard. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">But I'm like, \"Wow, she gave herself all that time to prepare.\" Every time there's something to do, or some event, she's like, \"I can't make it, I can't make it, I can't make it.\" I cannot say, \"I can't make it.\" She's so confident, it's brazen and I just feel weird. I get this when I'm lonely that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">I say these things. I'm sorry (chuckle).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: What are these things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Well just like negativity and bitchiness and crabbiness and complaining. Like, you know, that I did, everyone else in my room, are finer than I am. Like two years ago, not that long ago, I would be devastated to see photos of people having fun online. But that's because (inaudible) weeks and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">stuff, so ... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">That was a really bad period in my life. But still, like now I'm even better, like I see people like they're, \"I keep going to Alabama, and like 'ahh, I'm going crazy,'\" and like I don't have, I can barely (inaudible) like once a week. He's in back, you know? And these people have so much time they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200811\">go away for weeks and they're like lying on beaches, and there I am. I'm not that crazy about it, I'm just like, \"okay, I have my friend,\" sometimes, you know. So ... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559528\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">I chose to do something that requires a lot of hard thinking, sitting down in one place for hours and just calmly thinking, and you know, I don't want to have fun in Alabama anyway. I don't know. I'm just like screaming at people I can scream at (chuckle), like my mom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">But it's, it was a hard week, like filing her taxes and asking her, did they accept it, and did you check your e-mail? She's like blas about it, and like la, la, la, and she came over for lunch, and she's checking her e-mail, and (inaudible) the friend, and she left her e-mail open and I saw they rejected <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">the claim, and I'm like, \"Oh, my God.\" So I just kind of, with Chris's (ph) help, figured it out, and resubmitted it, and she then called me later, like, \"Oh, yeah, it got accepted, thank you.\" And I was like, \"You know, I told you to check your e-mail and it was rejected. It's only because you came <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">over and left your e-mail open that I saw it and fixed it, you know?\" Chris (ph) was like, \"Yeah, your mom was like this cartoon character like she walks, and can disappear.\" I don't know what's the name of that guy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">But I think he's blind and like he's just walking off and off a cliff or something. People just do things random who doesn't really know (chuckle). I don't know. I was asking my mom about next year and like the my boyfriend's roommate is moving out, so I can go back (chuckle). It's like entirely through <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">that house and live there. But, so that's where my mom, she will have a job, like \"I don't know.\" I don't know. I used to pride myself of the fact that I take care of her, but now it's like, I don't know what is it, you know? It was really nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">It's super to be able to take care of someone else, you know, especially your mom. But it's hard. I've been cranky a lot when I see things like, oh, you know, it's infringing on my freedom or my time and what I want to do, so (pause). Now at least I started the conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: How did it feel to start it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Awkward. I'd rather just have my (inaudible) (chuckle), stub my toe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">Chris's (ph) only, \"Oh yeah, (inaudible),\" I was like, \"No, that's how we talk.\" That is actually a good conversation, and as his ex, and she hears it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Do you feel she feels anxious about what you're saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Probably, you know, she wants to be in denial and not hear it because it's still it's hard to wake up when you're having (inaudible). I don't know, a nice dream. I mean, it's not all peachy and like a nice dream for (inaudible), because she probably feels (inaudible). But it's like, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">it's like talking to a wall, almost. It's like, \"So, do you want to live with this friend of yours?\" \"No.\" \"OK, is something you want your own place and you want me in it, and I don't want to, you know, get a job, so it's hard.\" Like I'm sorry, your life is so hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">I really, I'm not that blas or intolerant. I was there with you and I know how hard it was, and you know, it has broken my heart, and, you know, from the damage because of all that happened, but you know, like I want to do other things. Like I want, no that's not what I meant. But the struggle is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">yet over. I mean, as far as I can see, it's not over. You know, like I think she'd like to think that the days of our struggling are over, and she can relax and, but they're not over yet, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559528\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">And why, and maybe you should never think that way that those (inaudible) these are the years of I don't know, plenty, or something. Why do you think that way, you know? Just life is life, you know, and you face many problems and you have to adjust accordingly, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Do you think she feels that you owe her something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: No, but I feel that I owe her, so. I mean, don't you feel like the other parents? Well at least in my culture, like we're trained to think that we owe them our life, so especially me, because like I mean, she really did struggle a lot to bring me up, you know? So I see that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">And I want to, you know, repay her for it (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Are you (inaudible) your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: No, it's just (inaudible). I don't, she (inaudible) disgusting. I can't look at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling fidgety? Is that it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Because of what you're talking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: I suppose (chuckle).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You're talking about feeling burdened at the moment and ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying not to feel as burdened, like I remember when I still had my job, I felt burdened, and I remember like having this conversation with you where you said that I feel (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">Like putting a burden on me, like helping them out feels like a burden, or having a job feels like a burden. I mean, that's why I kind of, I was so frustrated and I quit out of frustration like because I felt like it was a burden, you know? Because I didn't want to do the job any more, so ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">I mean, instead of thinking, you know, without any judgment, you know, negative or positive, you know, it was a job. I applied for it and I got it and it's helping me pay my bills. Instead of that, I looked at it as, \"Oh my God, stifling me, ruining me.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I think it's safer to have those feelings about a job than your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I think you feel that way toward your mom, and I think it's hard to think about her that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is hard. Well, I just I just get so angry, like last night, like this whole weekend, I was frustrated with her taxes, and actually it was an easy year. She didn't have as complicated as many things as last year and previous years (chuckle). But like, she's calling me, like \"I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">to attend this meeting, I want this meeting.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">And I was just yelling at her, I'm like, I don't know, what time?\" And like, and I just felt like, \"I mean, can you really not see you know in the whole weekend I spend doing your taxes and then I have a visitor, or Chris (ph) has a visitor,\" and she needs to be looked after literally. And like she <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">just left and this (inaudible), and she left at 5:15 and the meeting's at 6, and you expect me to be there, like I wash my hair, I haven't exercised, my back hurts, I've been sitting around working, and I haven't done groceries and you really want me to come to the meeting? And like no one is coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB2\">there, like there's three or four people there. I just felt like so angry (chuckle). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559528\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">Like she can't see my point of view, you know? It felt like a betrayal, because I always try to see her point of view, you know?

Would that be OK?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: (giggle). Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: I know what we're talking about is really hard for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: No, it isn't (chuckle). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I think being angry at your mother is hard for you. I think talking about how you wish she could understand your perspective and understand that you have needs outside of her needs is hard for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: She has needs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: No, that you have needs outside of her because you're saying she's not recognizing that. She's not understanding of your point of view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't. And she's usually very, like, receptive and like, intuitive, you know? So I feel surprise that she's choosing to ignore this. I mean like, if I sit her down and just show her, like tell her, like, \"I'm making this, and this is your end, so how do you expect me to do anything else <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">with my money, like do anything you should maybe get something like a part-time job or something, you know?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">I feel like that might help, but I don't know if it will actually produce any results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Produce any results in terms of ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Her getting a job. I mean, like people take such care of themselves, and I've only just it's embarrassing that I'm so old and I've just realized that people have lives. And you know, you said it's hard for me to like, I don't know what word you use, you cleave away from my mother. What word <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">did you use? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">I don't know, just like separate myself from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I think I probably used separate, but cleave is a much more interesting term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: But cells cleave, don't they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Cells?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Cells, like cells that are connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: It has a much more conjoint idea that cleave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and I'm just now becoming aware that, you know, I have a separate identity from her, and so different from her, you know, like, I'm not her, and it's OK to be not her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">You know? To be a separate unit entirely, and like yeah, I just don't articulate what I want and I feel there's still little parts of like the summer, Chris (ph) said, OK, we have to buy our tickets, and decide what we're doing for the summer. So I just blindly said, you know, OK, fine, just go ahead <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F31\">and do it, you know, here's my money. Take it and buy a ticket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">And only now am I realizing no, I cannot go away for two months. I can probably go away for one month, and it's OK to say that, to have that. It's my money, so I should, you know, feel comfortable changing things around and figuring out what I want to do instead of tagging along with him. I hate that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F51\">you know? That's what I dread, and I still do it, despite everything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">I don't want to go to the places he's going to want to do, (inaudible), you know?

I'm like, \"Ahh, this is terrible,\" you know, so I don't know why I associate with that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">like, the thing may be the idea is going to go to Nepal with Chris (ph) and live in this place where there are lizards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: What about lizards scares you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: I don't know, freaks me out.

It feels wrong to say these things about my mom, I'm supposed to be loyal to her and look after her, so, but I just have to trust that I'm doing my best, you know? And actually try to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">my best and not shirk those the responsibility and like the emotion, like I'm ignoring, maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">And be realistic, a little bit too.

I'm waiting for her to find a job, so then all the explaining doesn't have to be done, you know? Then it's moot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: Right, but she may not find look for a job until she needs to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: Well she is on like the track where she has to pass an exam and then she can get her license and look for a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: You had mentioned that a long time ago.

I don't know. Like if someone tells me, \"This <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201551\">is a mistake you're making,\" I know I will try not to make it again. But she doesn't get it. (chuckle). So I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: So you're waiting for her to pass?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: She's passed, just like three exams, she's passed two.

What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Well, even if she passes her exam, it might be some time before she gets a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: I don't I mean, I don't know. Teaching jobs can be hard to come by, but I know the city schools in D.C. it might be easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: Well I don't know, because like she's doing a Masters degree, and she said that her teacher can help her, so, oh she's very personable. She makes friends everywhere she goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2017C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559528\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: So are you hoping that you'll no longer need to give her money once she gets a job?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah. I actually was like, \"So, how much money do you think you'll make?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">She's like, \"Yeah, maybe a (inaudible) $48,000,\" and I was like, \"Wow.\" That's more money than she's ever made. She never made that much, so ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">THERAPIST: How do you feel about waiting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">CLIENT: Waiting? I've been waiting, so ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: Well you've not been happy about it. You're getting less happy about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's, this thing with Chris (ph) also like that. Like, maybe it's separate, I'm just conjoining it (inaudible) cover up my fears, but like, you know, he wants, he doesn't want me out, but I should probably move out if we break up, but if I had all my paycheck for myself, I would be <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B1\">I would have that option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">I would see it as an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: So now you have to wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can wait, I suppose. It's not a bad life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're overstaying your welcome there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: No, he doesn't make me feel like that. But it's just, you know, this we keep going around in circles. It's not even a circle, it's like a tennis ball, like \"break up, don't break up, break up, don't break up.\" (chuckle) Because we're still, you know, intimate and stuff, and that can obviously <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201951\">confuse things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">And I like him and I appreciate him, but then I'm like, maybe I don't love him any more, and maybe I can love him again. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: Well I don't think that you want to recreate the situation your mother had where she felt trapped and there wasn't any way out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: You mean in the marriage, or ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: It seems like in her whole life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: What in what way is she trapped? When was she trapped?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: She was married she didn't have the opportunity to worship (inaudible) and go back to school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: And there is the (inaudible), and then over time she seemed saw herself as a victim and felt very trapped. Seems like her life is organized around being trapped with no options or choices. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. So being with Chris (ph) makes me feel like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Well I think the situation right now, you can't move out, you feel you can't move out because you don't have the choice to not give her money, and then I'm not sure if you're trapped with Chris (ph) to begin with, and then sort of feeling trapped about not having anywhere to go if you left him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I try not to think, to feel trapped. I try to tell myself that I came to live with him because it was a nice place, and you know, it was like this warm kind of womb where I could work, and I've been able to, so don't question that too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: What happens if you question it? You feel trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: The risk feeling trapped, yes. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">THERAPIST: So it's better to ignore it and just keep eating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah, if you put it that way (chuckle).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">THERAPIST: You're clearly trying to comfort yourself somehow or distract yourself somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT: But don't we do that while the situation is you might when you reach an impasse of some sort?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Right. Well the question is, why is there an impasse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT: Do you think I've made the impasse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">THERAPIST: I don't know if I would say made it, but I think you feel very stuck at it. I think it feels I think you can participate in it and solve it more than you feel I feel you have more control over it than you feel. I don't know if you created it, but on that note we need to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559528\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">THERAPIST: So I will see you Wednesday at our regular time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">CLIENT: At 9:00?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">THERAPIST: 9:00, and thank you for your flexibility today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, no problem.
