I was going to say I really like them because they fit really well and they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">hip and they were sort of cheerful, but there, I said it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I think your more formal pants fit well, too, but they\u2019re looser.

(long pause)  Something came to me this weekend and I can\u2019t really describe it fully, but I\u2019ll try. There is something going on or there is something that (pause) has the feel of moving in the direction of love, [like the last attachment here.] (ph?) Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">by me of you.  And there is something about the way that you\u2019re approaching this and me that like it seems all about that or it seems your knowledge of it seems aware of it. (long pause)  And that\u2019s really, really, really different from the way it is or from the way that it\u2019s [getting through to other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">people.] (ph?) (pause)  I think sometimes Ben and I could exist on that level, but because we\u2019re married we can\u2019t. There are conditional aspects of our lives that will always have to be there, but the way we love each other, if we were both just to float away forever right now, there is something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">that love that would be completely preserved.  Not that that\u2019s what love without attachment is, but like what it makes me think of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not clear about that part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking about how not knowing how you feel about me is like a critical (pause) part to make grow the love part and make not emphasize the attachment part.  Also, out of that emerges that even though it feels like it\u2019s a point that we don\u2019t share, like it\u2019s a point of difference, there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">actually something a little connecting about sharing a difference like that; or holding a difference like that together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: I think it actually, among other things, gives you a little more freedom, in that if you\u2019re asking [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:49) me to tell you and I don\u2019t consequently know. Then you can do what you want. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I can do what I want anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Well, let\u2019s be honest. Then you have to worry about what\u2019s fair to me or can I handle it or do you really want to know or what\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I get what you\u2019re saying. I think there is a different kind of freedom in not knowing and a different kind of freedom in knowing.  So far, it feels like it\u2019s started to shift, like when I thought about it this way this weekend. Like love with less attachment or love without attachment. But so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">far it feels like I\u2019ve been bound by not knowing \u2013 like it\u2019s in my way; it\u2019s limiting my freedom; it\u2019s forcing me to act in a certain way. It\u2019s eliminating most of the ways that I could act.  Or most of the ways in which I want to act. I think that\u2019s because I assume . . . (long pause)  I think I assume <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">deep down that the balance of your feeling is your feelings about me are similar \u2013 positive and similar to the balance of my feelings about you. I see you as quite different, both because of who you are and because of how you see yourself in this and how you see me.  But I think I feel bound by not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">knowing and I feel like a lot of ways of behaving aren\u2019t open to me because if I did know, I would know something that would allow me to behave affectionately in a different way than I do. It just occurred to me that I\u2019m making an exception. Also that I hope it, but that that\u2019s what I think is happening. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200294\"> That\u2019s what I assume is happening for you, positive feelings similar to mine; but you\u2019re just not telling me about it. Clearly, there is so much doubt that comes up that that feels like it\u2019s deep down and then it doesn\u2019t really rise to the surface as much as the doubt, in that way. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562120\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">There is something about this that has the potential to not be anything about what I assume or anything about what really is, regarding how you feel about me. (pause)  There could be something very powerful and healing and maybe even feeing, but it hasn\u2019t really felt that way about it. (pause) Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">slowly dropping or letting go of the things that I need to know and still love you.  (long pause)  It\u2019s in the letting go that the power and healing becomes entangled up and with that appears to be coming a shit-ton of pain. (long pause)  But not as much pain or the type of pain that shows up when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">think I\u2019m not supposed to love you or like I should stop or I should get rid of it or it\u2019s wrong. (pause) It\u2019s absolutely right for me, but there is a lot of other very attached attachments that seem to show up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Attachment and anxiety are very close in the way you\u2019re talking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, like by attachment I think I mean things aren\u2019t okay unless \u201cblank\u201d \u2013 unless I know this or unless you do this or you say this or you look at me this way or unless I feel a certain way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: So I think it\u2019s wrapped up in anxiety and sadness, like I\u2019m only happy if . . . There is only joy if . . . Maybe that\u2019s still anxiety.  (pause) They feel a little different for you. Both of them seem like they kind of . . . (pause) Sadness and anxiety.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I think when you love somebody, you like to feel like you\u2019re driving the bus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You get very anxious when you feel like you\u2019re not, in part because it\u2019s like it could go away or it won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s there.

There is so much about my own love that has nothing to do with driving the bus, but somehow that\u2019s what\u2019s most accessible or that\u2019s what\u2019s most powerful or that\u2019s what\u2019s most comfortable or makes me worry the least, to be in that position that there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">is so much there still if I were to get out of the driver\u2019s seat and sit on the bus with everybody else or get off the bus or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562120\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: The other person driving the bus, though, is another option.

I guess that\u2019s an option. It doesn\u2019t really work here as well as it might work in other love relationships because I\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re sort of driving some bus, but you\u2019re not driving my bus. (sniggers) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re on the bus. (pause)  Yeah. Sometimes it feels like you\u2019re at the bus stop and I\u2019m waiting for you to get on. The doors keep opening and closing. It sometimes feels like I\u2019m on your bus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I think that often when we\u2019re talking about different buses it feels like I\u2019m driving the bus; and I think that\u2019s terrifying. (pause) The example that occurs to me is that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten anything right today. I mean, I\u2019m teasing you a little bit here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Didn\u2019t wear the pants. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well the pants, I think, is related, but I think that\u2019s like you feeling like you\u2019re driving the bus and that you\u2019re going to embarrass me; so you were like, \u201cCan I say it or is that too much for you, Jay?\u201d And the first thing I said this about like control and freedom coming with not having <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">to be in control. You were like, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Well, I was like \u201cmaybe,\u201d but I don\u2019t feel free being on your bus.  I think it\u2019s a nice idea, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just the bus talk that [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t say that the freedom idea is wrong. I sort of explained that I feel bound by not knowing how you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:34) you\u2019re saying that you actually feel both, that you have felt bound, but actually something is changing and there are moments where you feel more free from that; not less love, but less bound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right, so that\u2019s not an example of how you were wrong. What\u2019s your next one? (both laugh)  I think you\u2019re insecure about being wrong. I don\u2019t have the impression so far today at all that you\u2019ve been wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Hmm. I\u2019m pretty sure you used the word, that you said something like \u201cno or well that may be true, but what I am talking about is\u201d this other thing over here. Actually it doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019re far apart on what the actual point is, in my mind. But yes, you think that there is some part <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">of it that I\u2019m insecure about being wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s another association that I\u2019m having. I guess I\u2019m a little reluctant to say it. I don\u2019t mean it in a critical way. I\u2019m a little concerned that it\u2019s my own recitation of it, but have you read the Pigeon on the Bus books?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Great kid\u2019s books about don\u2019t let the pigeon drive the bus. It\u2019s in the second person. The bus driver goes away and says don\u2019t let the pigeon come over and is like, \u201cHey, can I drive the bus?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: And is that the refrain? Don\u2019t let the pigeon drive the bus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: No. Ninety-five percent of the book is the pigeon asking to drive the bus. Come on, I have a friend who drives the bus. I have an uncle who drives the bus every day. What\u2019s the matter? It\u2019s just for ten minutes I\u2019ll drive the bus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: There are all these kids on the bus and they pick one pigeon?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562120\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: No, nobody is on the bus.

The pigeon goes, \u201cLet me drive the bus.\u201d And has this [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:00).  The response depends on the age of the kid. Sometimes it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, pigeon. No, you can\u2019t drive the bus.\u201d Just watching the pigeon for the [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:16).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: This is just a reference point right now, but I\u2019m imagining what about that and his whole life is through his books and it\u2019s starting to expand into play with Nora and himself. The first two some years, he was just like having this constant recitation of books and incorporating new things about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">the world as they show up in books.  I don\u2019t know, like a little [guardian] (ph?) with a red hat and a fluffy white beard. There are four or five books that make me think of and those books will come up and then the guardian will be grafted into it. But now there is a lot more. This is kind of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B2\">this book, but there is also this other thing, this real thing, and I can just imagine throughout the day asking him should the pigeon drive the bus, Abe?  I can imagine him saying, \u201cNoooo. Noooo. He\u2019s running around my [throne] (ph?).\u201d I think the pigeon should actually just have a try, don\u2019t you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B3\">that would be nice? It\u2019s also funny because Abe only talks about himself in the second person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: The second, so he would actually be one of us?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: He never says \u201cI\u201d.

There\u2019s something very shameless about the pigeon. There is something very shameful about the way that I feel about wanting to drive the bus. The idea that I could love you very, very much and know that that means I feel like I really need to drive the bus, but it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">have to mean that I can still love you very, very much helps with some of the shame. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: And maybe it makes me feel more like the pigeon for a while until, I hope, maybe I stop asking altogether.
