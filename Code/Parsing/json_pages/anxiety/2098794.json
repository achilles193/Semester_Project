I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Maybe not because it wasn't... It's not what he intended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What he intended. I mean, that's, that's why I listened to it at first because I imagine there were some things that he wouldn't have wanted to say directly to you but I don't think there's anything like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Okay. Then I guess just skip it because if it's something that he felt like he could say directly to me like I asked him what he meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) okay. That's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: And he kind of repeats himself anyway so... (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) What he said to me was (inaudible) what he said to me was that he was concerned that the intensity and exploratory nature of our work could in addition sort of benefits of being supportive and helpful in some ways have detrimental effects including making you more anxious and dysregulated. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: And that he was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: So that's basically a combination of what he told me and what I inferred from what he told me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And, yeah, he was sort of quite decent about it saying, \"Look. This is my hypothesis. We, you know, we don't know and, you know, you have a longer view and have worked with her a long time and she values the relationship.\" So, you know, he was sort of saying, \"You might give it some thought.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: But nothing more (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it's good or bad that I wasn't until like twenty four hours into that but I was like, \"Oh man. That's got to suck for Chad too.\" (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I mean, I imagine it happens sometimes but I also imagine that it must be really hard. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well, you know, I mean, for me I feel like it's a... I panic because I feel like it's, like, the relationship is going to be taken away from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: For you, I imagine it's a, you know, your professional judgment is called into question. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Like, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: And I mean, I don't, yeah. It's one of the things, it's one of the things that I'm worrying about but I feel like I'm learning about it in because of the lack of other things to worry about at this point. But it is hard for me to let go of even though I do feel like I've kind of done what he <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200591\">asked. I've given it a lot of thought and I still think he's wrong and tried to talk to him about it today and that wasn't going to go anywhere. So I said, you know... (LAUGHTER) I said, \"I don't think there's really a way to explain myself to you that's not going to come across as being very defensive <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200592\">or actually be very defensive.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098794\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: \"So I'm just not going to.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: And then he seemed fine with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: I think he was fine. I think he's pretty good but I think he's judging based on my chart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: And, you know, that's fine. That's what he had to do in this situation. I wish that he were more receptive to other information because, you know, it's his job, it's his job to kind of hypothesize, as he said, like calculate based on what's in my chart because he's not going to get a chance <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">to get to know me. He still has to listen to what I have to say. But when he doesn't do that, that's when he makes a really big mistake in my view. And I don't feel like he listened to what I had to say. Oh well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: It feels like, it feels like the situation was (inaudible at 00:06:17) over again actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Not in, you know... There's not a romantic aspect to my relationship with you this is, you know, that I'm aware of or at large or whatever. But rather that like you're somebody who really supports me, who I really care about and I really depend on and I feel like I am being told, \"This isn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">okay. This isn't appropriate. You have to walk away.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: And I feel like it's... I'm being told that the right thing to do would be to walk away and that I find... That makes me anxious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Umm... (SIGH) (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, what, what matters to you is being ignored and you're not really being listened to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. He kept saying, \"If the therapy were working so well you wouldn't be in the hospital.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: And I think he kept returning to it because it's the hardest thing to refute, because it sounds like a very big clear, final reasoning. But I think it's really not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Like okay well, therapy is one aspect of my life. There are many other aspects that have kind of gone to shit. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:08:31) quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I've, I've been giving this emotion regulation thing a lot of thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: And well yeah I have kind of dropped the ball in terms of pragmatic skills and I do, you know, I do find times when thinking about or like exploring ways that I'm upset just makes me more upset and out of control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">But those are not all of the times and I feel like when I worry too much about keeping a lid on things I become more anxious and less able to tell what is actually going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. I also told him that (LAUGHTER) the reason I appeared much more emotionally regulated the second or third, in the latter half of our meetings was I had come to realize that we wouldn't be able to communicate effectively so I appeared upset at all. So... (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: He seemed to take it pretty well. I'm not sure that it means that he just couldn't take it in but I don't know. I don't know whether that was just me being a jackass or whether that was actually useful information but it felt good to say. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098794\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I don't see why you shouldn't tell him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Well yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Because it gets in the way of other communication. But that was the last time we were going to meet so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Right and I think that's a tricky differential diagnosis for you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: ...when communicating more directly what you think really gets in the way of further, is going to get in the way of further communication and when it's going to enhance further communication. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: In other words, saying like saying something (inaudible) other person doesn't want to hear and imagining it's going to fuck everything up rather than actually make your thoughts (inaudible) feelings, whatever more known in a way that actually contributes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah and I have trouble with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: I noticed particularly with me being in the hospital and being around so many people who are so loud.

Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I... (PAUSE) I guess from what I've seen there are times when things we talk about do disregulate you some. I think that's inevitable and this sort of couldn't occur without it and so the question in my mind is... Well, mostly that I think seems to work out, it seems to me fairly well, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">I'd be interested in your thoughts about it In other words, sometimes or even oftentimes things we talk about are upsetting. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: And then it's appropriate to be upset. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah and to be upset and the hurt and confusion and frustration sometimes stays with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And that's sort of inherently part of the therapy. And I guess the concern would be if there are times that... There are two concerns there. One is if that stuff became too much or became more of a source of trouble than you could sort of manage or didn't seem worth it. And then the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF1\">thing would be, you know, sometimes you get into a cycle like that where things just sort of, you know, get worse and worse in the therapy... And that's, you know, pretty clearly not what's going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And as far as the first (inaudible) it doesn't seem that way to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I guess there are probably sometimes where it's happened but my impression is most of the time...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: And that's how it feels to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I, I'm in, you know, position of, again, I feel like I'm being asked to distrust my recollections and my sense of things. So I'm always up for some skepticism. So... But, yeah, that is how it feels to me.

The first one is... Well I guess I get the impression that you are more concerned, more upset, more wanting to stop doing it or feeling like either to our paying attention to it or working on it more in here or in some way you kind of deal with it more or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D1\">like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012F\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess, I guess I'm more concerned about it now because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20133\">CLIENT: ...I've, from seeing it through other people's eyes more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20135\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">CLIENT: And I think, \"Oh, yeah.

The hospital people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (PAUSE) There really doesn't seem to be a good consensus on how, how, on the distinction, if there is one, between masking emotions and regulating them.

She does all the (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201531\">00:22:59) Well, you don't want to bottle up your emotions but at the same time...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">CLIENT: ...those skills that she's teaching are pretty much that's what they do for me, for me at least.

There you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">CLIENT: Then clearly. But she was just super focused on, \"I know all of the DBT (ph) skills and can tell you about the groups so that I dominate every group all of the time.\" And God that got under my skin and of course it gets under my skin because I see myself in her. And I want to talk all the time <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201731\">so it annoys me when she's talking all the time. (LAUGHTER) But... Yeah. But (inaudible) I'm sure she was actually using those coping skills but talking about them a lot was also a symptom of needing to dominate the conversation, needing to have everyone's attention and affection and admiration, adulation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201732\">et cetera. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20175\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20177\">CLIENT: So... So then I go back and forth between saying, \"Well, I feel like I'm way more self aware than most of the people in here.\" But maybe that is just another side of me really being in denial because I feel like I think everybody else here is in pretty deep denial about one thing or another <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201771\">so in general you don't get to be the exception.

(LAUGHTER) Actually, yeah, I just had a hard time with the people this time around. You know, I did kind of make some friends and that's good but I felt like, I felt like most people there any relationship I had was just like sucking the energy out of me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">CLIENT: And I don't know how much of that is me and how much of that is them.

(inaudible at 00:27:55) it also occurs to me that you weren't in there because you were at your best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) There's that, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20191\">THERAPIST: Where I'm going is to say that, like, you know, it's draining to be in the kind of shape you were in.

Yes, even if you didn't feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201D11\">that good before you stopped taking it, you feel worse after. Yes, that's how medication works.
