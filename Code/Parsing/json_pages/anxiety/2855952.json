(inaudible at 00:00:01)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: What s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Somewhere someone s died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah, nobody I knew died [in Wisconsin].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Everybody was safe. I didn t take anybody out. They didn t take me out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, hello. So the problem this time, this lady I live with so I was working last night. I was working, working, working. And this is after I just sort of like, I was playing Words with Friends and doing nothing for a whole day. I have a paper that was due last Saturday, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Last Saturday. So I m kind of like well, I should probably work on this, should work on this, should work on this. And this goes on for days and hours on this particular day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Then it starts to get a little dark and I just started working. I m working and it s going great. It s wonderful. Like my ideas are really good. But this particular assignment was to rearrange everything of our previous draft. Like rearrange all the like revise it, basically. And so I have to incorporate <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">these director s comments and what I know also needs improvement. Kind of fix it and in the process, risk making it a lot worse. I m forced to tear apart all the little pieces that constitute the whole and sort of filter them and refine them and put them back together and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">Anyway, I was working and I was looking at the time and for once, the time was going slowly. Like I was working normally when I m working on a late project, the time just like disappears. I m like writing (chuckles) and you re thinking I have two more things to do in x amount of time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: And I should be able to do them in that amount of time. And then by the time you re done with the first two things, you know, an hour and a half has elapsed. And this time, things were going slowly. [It turned out I was] working productively. And going downstairs, I just I did not want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">be seen. I wanted to make the food that was necessary to keep me going and eat it, probably in my room. And just not being seen was very important and the same sort of I got a prompting from some inner voice that said, you know, Sherry, the lady I live with, She s going to like come and look, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">you have to decide what you re going to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: She s going to try and see if you re out and may want to talk to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So I had one of these sorts of missions like Don t let her see you or talk to you. It was really important. And I can t even I think it might even be like animal. I don t necessarily attribute it to anything in myself which proves that I m crazy, if you don t attribute it to anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">what would you say pathological.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: It s just like I m working on something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You don t want to be interrupted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I can make up all kinds of justifications for it like, you know, I m [at this place] where I have complete authority and where I understand what s going on, and I don t want to have to establish a relationship with anyone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855952\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Or explain myself to anyone else who is very, very far from where I m at, you know. Or I have to take into consideration I haven t shaved or all these things that they won t understand. I don t want to have to think about or recognize them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">They are entirely superfluous. They serve no function in terms of what I m trying to do, so their presence would upset some kind of delicate balance that I have going where I m enjoying what I m doing and eager to go back and actually functioning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Indeed she came into the kitchen. The woman uses a wheelchair, but she like walked around the other direction. So I didn t realize too that her son was visiting. She owns the house, I rent a room, and her son was coming home. I didn t think when I had this like mechanical voice that tells me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">things to do sometimes, I didn t think the son was home, so I ll have to avoid being seen by him too. But I couldn t escape, except by going out the back door which I didn t think to do. I just sort of stood there, and she came into the kitchen with no purpose whatsoever. I had the light off to avoid <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">being seen and I just had a burner going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I was just looking at like a box of macaroni and cheese because I usually make the white cheddar, but this time it was like alfredo, so I had to look at the box. But she, for her part, like staggered over to the radio and like fiddled with the radio and then went over to the chicken. There was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">some chicken there, I guess. She was like Hi, [Donald]. I m just like Hi. (chuckles) It s a total defeat. It s completely not arbitrary. It s almost fixed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: It s fated. It s like the opposite of arbitrary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: It s that you didn t want to get you wanted to remain unfettered by like her by somebody else s intrusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I think about it, it s hard to justify. I mean, it s not like being alone is typically a very enjoyable experience for me. But at the same time, I don t know. It s not at the same time. I just didn t want to be bothered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Not only that, but that there was something that could disrupt whatever you were feeling before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And indeed, I just felt hatred towards her and her son for the rest of the night. I mean, after she came in, her son came in and like either I heard I definitely heard the word weird but, I mean, it could ve been in reference to anything. In any event, I concluded that he had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">called my behavior weird which, I mean, I can understand. Because when he came in, I wasn t eager to engage him either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Like he said like What s up? How s it going? I m just like Great or I said some minimal possible -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: thing without even expressing any body language or facing him or anything. (pause) Yeah, so I figured he called my behavior weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: That s the whole problem with it, is that there s a privilege to view. There s a sort of violence which takes place, I think, in being seen -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: and assessing, and I don t want to be assessed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: And it s exactly what I m talking about, is that I ended up thinking about like what he was thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855952\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Which is precisely what I wanted -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: What you wanted to avoid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you know what it made me think of not to butt in, but I ll do it anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Is the experience of you you know, your aunt accusing you of watching porn. And what it made me think of is that, you know, at that time in your life, it sounded like well, of course, you were kind of like growing into being starting to have sexual fantasies or whatever, but her intrusion <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">in that characterized it in a certain way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And it corrupted the whole experience for you. And there s a way that like you know, what I was sensing is that you felt some good kind of feeling working in [industry] or something like that, and you didn t want to be disturbed in that mindset. Whatever mindset you were in, you didn t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">want it to be disturbed and thinking that their mindset would interfere with yours. And it did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: (pause) It could change something that can feel very positive into something kind of like critical or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It does. Sometimes I kick myself for just like saying hello or something like that. Why should I even respond to them? Do I have any duty to acknowledge them? I don t think so but, I mean, I end up doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (pause) Well, it s kind of like they re if you didn t say I mean, there s still an unavoidable kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: presence or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah and, I mean, they might keep asking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: [It becomes a lot of trouble]. (pause) I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, almost like I imagine your response being the one that would be the least intrusive or the least interfering. You just try to go back to what you were doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: (pause) So, yeah, and also thinking about the argument. I mean, it would be pretty strange for someone to call me weird when like two people are coming into the kitchen with no purpose whatsoever, just to like look at me. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: And I m the one who actually had something to do. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And I m the weird one, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: (pause) (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) Well, yeah, it s important. I m writing an important paper. I don t know. I m at that stage where I ve worked on it so much that (inaudible at 00:11:03) but it s a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">It s on like democracy and how economics sort of appropriates political not political, but traditionally political vocabulary. So it focuses on an advertisement from 1960 where Richard Nixon talks about economics, and he has this awkward sort of commercial where he s talking about the importance <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">of economic growth. It has like familiar political terms in it, but what ends up happening, the main point of it is, it marks the transition of like a principled application of (inaudible at 00:11:46) in politics to a pragmatic sort of answering needs with ideology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Where before, it s right to do this, we ll do this, [this is the political ethic] afterwards but those sort of statements only they justify more pragmatic policies, but they don t motivate them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah. (pause) But using an economic circumstance to justify an ideology.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855952\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: To justify an ideology. (pause) That s a fragment. I don t know what you re asking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that what your paper is about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Using economics to justify -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: That Nixon was using economics to justify an ideology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: No. He was using ideology to justify economics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.

So he says that you have to stay strong. We have to keep growing to remain strong and free, and only if we stay strong can we keep peace. So peace sort of (inaudible at 00:13:16) grow economically and ambiguously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: And sort of maintain the status quo and that sort of pernicious (inaudible at 00:13:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: But it s important because I sense a palpable disconnect from political participation, and I think it probably has its roots in economics or sort of subsumption of politics in general, national politics, by economic interest. I mean, that s what I have to write in my cover letter now because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">it s mostly done. Just before I got here, I mostly finished it. It took forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: There s a cover letter to write.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, a cover letter. The last one I wrote was quicker. It was quick, quick. The last one I wrote on the last draft of this I wrote on July 4th. I like had a party and we were drinking, and then I realized I had to finish my paper. (chuckles) So I like sat at a desk. People were like What <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">are you working on? (laughter) [At the party, whatever]. Economics, politics, subsumption. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">Oh yeah, so like when you talk about Iraq, when we finally pulled out, it wasn t really an ethical decision. It s never ethical in politics. Like it s right to move out of Iraq. We shouldn t have gone to Iraq. We shouldn t have killed like untold millions of Afghans and Iraqis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">It doesn t make financial sense for us to be there, so let s pull the troops out. We know our troops are getting killed. It s entirely pragmatic. Where in the past, you might have experienced that like Vietnam. How were we in Vietnam? That s more ethical, principled rhetoric in politics. Now we adhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">to a pragmatic neutral, or putatively neutral, discussion of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">But the point that might be relevant here is that the essay, it really just encodes my own needs. So what I express as like a need for political participation and absence of an ethic and the political discourse of a nation, in fact, represents my inability to give a shit or do anything. You know, they re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">big terms, but I realized how big this was the other night, and it sort of fades in and out of focus, but I m not functioning. Like I can t decide to do something and do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">I can t I have like it sounds so empty, but when writing I m realizing I have quite a faculty which could be applied to any number of uses, and the idea that I waste most of my time is a travesty. It s not good. So I m not sure how to frame it correctly or get the experience up in myself, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E51\">it s related to that idea that I m constantly stating about being on my heels versus sort of on my toes. It s actually part of an imaginary speech I never gave to my old swim team where I say (chuckles) there are two ways to go about practice. You can sort of do what you re told to do and suffer through <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E52\">it, or you can actively approach each block of work that you re given and do your best at it. I don t do the latter one almost ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855952\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">But the deadline is just one example. I mean, I m working on a paper. It s good because I started working on it out of nowhere. It s not like the professor contacted me or anything. I ve been meaning to do it for days, but usually I have to be forced by some external circumstance. I depend on my procrastination <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">to motivate me to do things. (pause) That s why my encounters with people who actually have some constitution or they have a life, so to speak when someone says Get a life then they have an economy to their life. They have an idea of what they can do to support themselves emotionally, financially, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E92\">or in some sense.

I mean, I (pause) I need that for myself [to function]. (inaudible at 00:18:30) people I get obsessed with, it s a sort of that s a pathology <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">based on my own dysfunction. It s like I don t know how to relate to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: One thing that I was just hearing though is that, I mean, your paper made me think about was that your work or say, for instance your writing, in your mind, in your intellect, I think you felt like you really needed to have and who doesn t need to have this but like needs to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">it carry a meaning with it. You use that for a meaningful purpose, for something that has some sort meaning in your life. One that really feels, well, meaningful to you. (chuckles) Not to survive or to get a pat on the head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) What s important to me, at least as I can conceive it now, is that there is a sustainable pattern. So masturbation is still very upsetting because (pause) The reason is because I constantly formulate over and over again this idea of who I am or a choice that s important to make, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F51\">not to for any number of reasons which may be real, fictitious or subjective, I make a decision not to look at porn, not to masturbate. And inevitably I m drawn back to it and forced to act in a way other than I conceived, in three-day intervals over the past 10 years of my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">So I formulate a plan, I move forward with that, and the plan fails. Over and over again in a cycle. And it sort of characterizes my I hesitant to say my adult life, but it characterizes my outlook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. (pause) What happens? I mean, what do you feel like when you say you do it despite the plan? What does that mean to you then? That you ve done it despite the plan?

(pause) Well, it means I fail. It means I don t accomplish what I need to do. I mean, it s just like my paper. I mean (chuckles) the principle is defeated. The principle doesn t subsist. I have to sort of lie to myself and reconstruct it. (pause) I mean, I justify it all the time, before <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201031\">and afterwards.

A futility to forming any plan.

Instead of it feeling like alright, there s a sexual encounter with something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">that means something more to you. It s not empty because you re feeling alright, you break down because you really need to have some erotic feeling.

It somehow creates like a paradigm for this sort of aimless behavior. I think on some level okay, so the sexual impulse has to be pretty strong or else a species or humans would cease to exist. It kind of has to overcome reason, you know, any sort of obstacles <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201271\">put in its way, really. So there s that. (pause) Oh yeah, so I think by the same token, it sort of triggers a lot of physical, possibly spiritual, but physical reactions that sort of trick me into thinking that, you know, I ve achieved something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">It sort of fetishizes a neurochemical or however you want to put it it fetishizes an aimlessness adrift and disbursed by occasional encounters with a pornographic website, you know. It s not like I m being rewarded for accomplishing anything or rewarded for intimacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: I m being reinforced in my loneliness and isolation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I was thinking there s a biological interest, I think, in sort of keeping the amount that a certain individual reproduces low. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201351\">So like [if you went into] my thinking, like if a wildebeest had sex with a thousand wildebeests, that wouldn t be beneficial to the population because it wouldn t enable it [with diversity]. Like there s you wouldn t want the predominance of any one gene or gene pool, so it would make sense if <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201352\">physical okay, so there s another part to this too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">I think cancer is like biologically mitigated, or like we produce our own cancer and it s not functionless.

[I guess it s rooted in some experience].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Right. Yeah, I guess experiments actually show that people who masturbate a lot are fine, and people who masturbate almost none are fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">But in people who masturbate occasionally, there s a sort of curtailed I think they have [deleterious health effects in their life spans].

They would feed everything they could to the one person they thought could do the job best. It could be that nature favors a strong individual or what [the body] thinks of as a strong individual because that person is jacking off all the time. [They would favor <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201631\">that person with health benefits or something].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Potency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: (pause) I m also actually like my mother. I procrastinate so with the people, besides this incident, before that I was thinking that these people keep wanting to talk to me, and I just tell them no, and that s because I have to do my paper. But I don t do my paper most days, or I didn t. I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201671\">sort of waited in my room and did nothing or masturbated usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">But I just keep saying No, I can t do this now, I can t talk now, I can t do this.

They sort of operate within their own head and sort of move parts around in [there verbally]. That s what they project outwards. I don t want to become like that, and that s part of why I ran from what I think I I stopped going to school. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">Yeah, but crucially, I don t have anything (inaudible at 00:39:14). I m writing this paper now, but generally I don t do things. [It sort of] represents a problem. (pause) Lazy. I m lazy. I mean, it took me a long time to apply that, but I m pretty lazy. I have this sort of rigor about the way I keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F1\">things and characterize myself, but I m pretty lazy. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">It s like I m an anarchist for myself. I sort of rebel against anyone else s view of me, and then I get to myself and there s nothing there. There s no plan. I m not saying there couldn t be and I definitely think there should be, but my experience thus far has been I don t mobilize myself well. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201931\">I can t even conceive I can t grasp the machinery to make me [do something]. (pause) (inaudible at 00:41:52). I was playing Words With Friends and I was looking at all these possibilities and they were fantastic. Have you played Words With Friends?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: Okay, so I could have all these words, but when I got to a pressure point I looked at this word finder. I was like, how many words are there actually that I could do here? There were like three. I mean, I apply that throughout my experience because I take a long time to consider every possibility <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201991\">of what I might do. And the fact is in probably most of those scenarios, there are a pretty discrete limited number of possibilities. It s something that makes me very good at what I devote my attention to and also very involved, almost to the paralyzation of everything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">And handicapped at some things, just because I cannot like with this paper, I can t submit something better than the complete less than the complete idea. It has to be finished and done well. Nothing else will suffice. (pause) And yet a lot of my energy is devoted to things that [aren t applicable]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D1\">I m thinking about the stretch, always the stretch. Would could be, what could be, what could be, not [anything that pertains to] (inaudible at 00:43:46).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: What s the stretch?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2019E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855952\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">CLIENT: The stretch is [forbeyance or parataxis] or some long word that s alluded to by the letters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">When you have some of the letters and not to imagine the word but based on what s on the board, you can t put together a longer word. It s not going to happen. And there are other longer words and they re not going to happen, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Oh, uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">CLIENT: There s one in a hundred times that my thinking about a longer word might produce that word -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">CLIENT: in reality, but it s good when it does. It s very good. But in the meantime, it takes up a lot of my mental energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">THERAPIST: That s somewhat of a metaphor for -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, that s the only way I can understand whatever I m talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. (pause) Before we stop, there s another Friday that I m going to be out. It s August 1st. I could meet that Thursday at 10 a.m. though, which would be July 31st.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">CLIENT: Isn t that next week? What is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB\">CLIENT: Okay. Sounds good for Thursday, the 31st.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there s just some Fridays, especially during the summer when I m just, you know, I take off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">CLIENT: Getting tanked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">THERAPIST: What s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Getting what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">CLIENT: Getting tanked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Getting tanked, yeah.
