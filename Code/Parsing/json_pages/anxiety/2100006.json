(chuckles) No, it's been funny because one of my eyes has been crying and I told him \"I'm not that sad.\" (chuckles) Hello. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: It's been kind of a busy week, actually. My friend visited me from San Diego, which was nice. She was here the whole weekend from Friday and left this morning. It was just kind of a long time to spend with someone. (chuckles) But she's nice. And there was one point that I thought of you actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">because we were in I don't know, we were doing tourist things, I think it was some cemetery downtown. She said something I like saw like a Anderson which is the name of the guy that or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So I was like \"Oh, look, it's so-and-so. Oh, awful.\" I made some comment. And she was like \"You shouldn't be angry with him\" and I was like \"What?\" (chuckles) It was like screeching tire marks, like \"Whoa.\" (chuckles) And I was like \"Excuse me?\" (chuckles) And then I kind of I wasn't like overtly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">angry but I was firm, like really firm, and was like \"Hey, you don't know anything about what happened between me and him\" because I've never really told her stuff. And I don't think I forget exactly what I said, but it was something like \"That's not for you to say.\" Something like really firm or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Assertive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: potentially a little bit rude. (chuckles) And I don't know why, it just like came out. Because I was angry but I wasn't like explosively angry, and I knew that I would've otherwise been like angry with her for days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And it was funny because right after I told her, I was like \"Hey, you don't that's not right of me to say\" or something. I picked right back up where we left off and it was like \"Oh my God, look at that cool thing\" and totally meant it. It wasn't like a distraction strategy or whatever. So that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">was really interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: How did she respond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I think she may have thought about it a little longer than me. (chuckles) I felt kind of bad about it, but I didn't feel bad because of the circumstances. She really doesn't really know what happened between us, and it's not right of her to say you should or shouldn't feel a particular way. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">Even though I do it all the time. (chuckles) But I don't know. It just felt really wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: To be told what you are allowed to feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. Especially regarding that. And I mean, the thing was I was kind of kidding. Like it was like a joke. I was like \"Oh so-and-so,\" like whatever, and I think she took it seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And I was like \"Whoa\", even if it was serious. \"Not cool\" kind of thing. And so that was I don't know. That was really nice too. I mean, it wasn't really nice but like it was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It felt good to be able to assert yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I think it felt good not to hold a grudge for the next three days. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That's probably a big relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. Or not to have to go back and be like \"Hey, remember that one thing you said? That really bothered me.\" (chuckles) You know, like because that's usually how it goes. Like if something bugs me, I have to but this was so immediate, I was like \"Whoa, wrong.\" So that was nice. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">I wish I could do that more often, like recognize because it's so much easier to say \"Hey, what you just said, that's not cool\" than to be like \"Hey, remember that thing you said five weeks ago? It really bothers me.\" (chuckles) So I guess that was interesting too. (clears throat) Sorry.

That happened and it seemed kind of really important for me. And then the other thing that happened was actually this morning. So my mom and I never text, right? Like we never text. Until like two or three weeks ago we started texting. And it's funny because I'm trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">to teach her how to text. I'm like \"Mom, you don't have to say goodbye after you text. Like you just stop texting.\" (chuckles) And she's like \"bye.\" (chuckles) And now my brother started saying \"bye\". (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: To copy your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (chuckles) But anyway, I texted her. I was like \"Hey, going to the professor.\" She was like \"Oh, you didn't feel\" she called me back and she said \"Oh, you're not feeling well. That sucks\" or whatever. We started talking. I don't know how we got on the topic oh, my brother <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">is at the Island. I don't know if you've heard of Watson Island in New Mexico.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Spring break, right? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: It's where you go if you don't go to Austin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. So my brother is there for his spring break. It's kind of a big deal it's like about 15 minutes away from where I grew up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It's kind of a big deal. It's where like you go when you're a little bit more grown up, and people sometimes go there to drink and do stuff, whatever. And I never got to go when I was younger. I said something along the lines of \"Oh, that's funny\" because we were kind of talking about my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">dad too. I don't exactly remember the conversation. But I was like \"Oh, that was pretty sexist of him.\" Of him, like I was blaming him, not my mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">And my mom and then I said something like \"What do you think?\" And she was like \"I can't believe that like\" she got really flustered and angry and was like \"I can't believe you're bringing this up. You've already said it. Stop saying it. What do you want me to say?\" I was like \"Whoa.\" Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">I was totally on like happy conversation time, and she went straight to angry mom time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I was like \"Whoa.\" (chuckles) So I actually hung up on her because I was like so angry. I was like \"Whoa, dude. I'm like trying to have a real conversation with you and you got all mad.\" So I texted her back, which I've never done before. (chuckles) And we had like this really weird exchange of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">things we've never said to each other before. I actually I have it and I kind of wanted to read it to you in translation. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Because it's just so weird. But we said a lot of really important things. And I said like she said, I said it a lot of times on the phone or whatever. And I said \"I only said it once or twice. I don't know why you got so mad. I would like for you to be able to listen to me without <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">getting mad, especially when it has to do with something that has affected me so much. Like the discriminatory way in which dad treated me because of my gender.\" It sounds much less awkward in French.

It's awkward phrasing. And my mom said \"Look [inaudible at 00:07:30],\" which is me. \"For the time in which it was for\" the time that we lived in or whatever \"it is normal that we got worried and more because\" my older brother \"was so calm and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">you were a complete revolution.\" (chuckles) \"It's not about sexism, and it seems almost like a lie that you're so old now and you're still coming up with this.\" And she said \"You always tried to fight for your independence\" or liberty or whatever you want to call it \"and when that's everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">that you see, then you can't do anything but worry.\" Like as a mom, she means. And she says something -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Because you were trying so hard to get away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: She was really it made her even more nervous -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: about what you might do if you got away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Right. I think that's what I guess, I don't know. (chuckles) That sounds like something she'd agree with. I just never and she says like \"You automatically assume that because I disagree with you that I'm mad, and notice who hung up on who.\" (chuckles) I said like, okay. And so I said <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">\"I'm not saying I wasn't difficult, but that I wanted to be independent should've been something good, not something for you to worry about. And for as hard as I was\" to raise or whatever \"I still think that it was that I was a girl made a difference, and that's just not fair.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">And I said \"And if I continue to think about these things at this age, it's because it affected me a lot and as a woman, it continues to affect me and because and that's why it's so important to me to be independent and autonomous because I never felt like I had that opportunity as a kid. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">thought it was more dad, but I didn't know that you were also in agreement, and I don't care that you\" (pause) I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: \"And I don't care if you disagree, but I do care that you listen to me respectfully and that you don't get flustered and angry when I tell you something that you think is ridiculous.\" (sniffling) Sorry. That's gross.

It's gross. (chuckles) And she says \"It's not ridiculous. It's just out of place. And like you said, you were a child and the function of the parents is to avoid danger when they still need to mature. Also, Jean [ph] \" my little brother \"didn't go alone, [one of the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">moms] is with him.\" (chuckles) I was like okay, are we still talking about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">\"Well, I disagree that my opinion is out of place and at the very least, it was my experience\" I'm sorry. \"And at the very least, if that was my experience, I would like for you to recognize that that's how I felt and that because that's how I felt, that's a valuable point of view.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But it's interesting that maybe that's it's not that one of you is right and one of you is wrong, but that you just viewed it through a very different lens. She saw calm versus a complete 180 from that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And you're seeing it \"boy, all this privilege; girl, not.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Right. And that's totally fine. Like I don't need her to agree with me on that, but I do need her to hear me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: [You needed her to hear you.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: That you certainly felt like you were being treated in a way because of your gender.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right, right. I mean, partially it's because I do think that. Like if my older brother had tried to assert his independence at my age -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: It may have been seen as -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Boys being boys, or whatever. But, you know, I don't care that my little brother has more opportunities than I do. Like that would be so evil of me. (chuckles) Like I want him to have like stuff that I couldn't have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But you want her to recognize that he has things that you didn't have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: And I think you said it very well in saying that \"You don't need to necessarily agree with me, but I need you to listen to me in a respectful way.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: \"And treat my feelings as valid because they're my feelings.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Right. And I think it's kind of a big deal too because like when my mom started I think in the first reply text or whatever she said something like \"at these heights\", meaning like \"you're so old and you're saying this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: She wants you to get over it already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. And I think part of because I do that all of the time. I'm like, I'm so old. I feel like a six year old talking about stuff that happened in elementary school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But if it's never been acknowledged it's not that having it acknowledged is important, and you keep bringing it up because you feel like you haven't been heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. But I think that has always been the way that feelings have been treated in my house. Like once a certain amount of time elapses, then it's like totally uncool and be like \"Hey, what was that about?\" I think that part of what this meant to me was that I could be like \"Hey, you can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">just say that what I feel doesn't matter because it happened so long ago. Like here's how it makes me feel today.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">(chuckles) Which, I don't know, seems really important to be able to do that, especially because that's how the whole family feels and it's not how I feel. I can't just get over stuff because it was, I don't know, 10 years ago. (chuckles) It sounds ridiculous, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: What do you think stops you from being able to let it go? Rather than judge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: I think it was yeah, I mean, I think part of it is because I never felt like she knew. I never I don't know. It was lonely. Like I was carrying this alone, you know. (crying) And I was so surprised too because I think that my mom was treated different for being a woman, differently for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">being a woman. I would think it kind of hurt my feelings. It was like \"But you're a woman too and like you should feel these things, or at least recognize that maybe this is the way that I\" but I think that's something where generational differences might actually play in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">Because I didn't feel like it was just me. I felt like she experienced it too, which made it even more lonely, right? (chuckles) But I don't know. I mean, I don't think I'm not necessarily letting go. I do feel like it's in the past. (pause) But I'd never told her before, I guess. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: So you were maybe not carrying the incident, but carrying the fact that she never got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Right. And it definitely shapes the way that I see stuff now. Like the time that my dad kind of drove me around and thought I was gay and yelled obscenities at me for hours. Like that means that I have a really strong ally for like you know, I don't know. Like it's really important to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB1\">And so I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">Like maybe in the same way, part of like the whole Julia thing, why it bothered me so much is because I'm like like I fought against this my whole life, and like having it I guess in my life now is really bothersome because I'm trying to move away, and I don't need to be in a relationship or whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">and I think that's okay. I think that if I did need to be in a relationship, it would be a problem. And seeing that so close to me I think is a little hard. (pause) Yeah. I did ask Angela [ph], by the way homework. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah? How did that go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: I didn't quite know how to phrase it, so I was like \"Please don't be offended at the way I'm asking the question, but I have no idea how else to ask it. I totally mean it as a real question.\" (chuckles) And I asked her, I was like, \"How can you still be friends with Julia because I know that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">all this stuff bugs you about her\" and like whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">And we kind of talked about it, and it was actually a really nice conversation. She said that she kind of views us as on a spectrum and she's like in the middle. And she actually kind of told me that she feels like sometimes like she wishes that she could speak up about stuff. Like Julia told Angela <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">[ph] that it was awkward to talk to me at one point remember the kitchen conversation we had the other day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: She told Angela [ph] that she thought that was awkward and I was like \"Yeah, that was awkward, okay.\" But Angela [ph] knew why it was awkward but she didn't want to say anything. She was like \"okay\" and was really vague and changed the topic. She was like \"I wish I could've said something.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">So she says that she kind of wishes she could say more, but she can't because of the way that she grew up or whatever. But that she definitely sees us like on a spectrum and that she's kind of in the middle but closer to me, and so we relate a lot more than she does to Julia, but like I guess she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB2\">like her biggest thing is like to keep the peace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">So she doesn't want to fight with anyone and I'm like \"Okay, that makes total sense. Like I understand.\" (chuckles) And you were right. After I asked her and we talked about it, like it was totally like the whole feeling of resentment that I had for her hanging out with Julia or whatever, it didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">totally go away but it definitely eased up a lot. I was like okay, well, because I think part of it was like maybe she likes you because she likes her more than me. What if it means that she hates me and isn't telling me and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: You didn't understand it so you started making assumptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Without giving her a chance to explain sort of her process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: And that you didn't have to make guesses anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Exactly. And I don't know. I think we got closer after that, like it was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Wow. You've taken a lot of risks these past couple of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, I guess. It's been a little hard. (chuckles) But that actually felt really nice. That was easy. (chuckles) (pause) And so, yeah, I don't know. I think that's it's weird though because I've been thinking back to our previous sessions, and I remember I used to be like oh God <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">it was like this whole situation, right? Like in my head, my whole life was a disaster and I was like okay, well, I've got to start picking apart at pieces. I was like okay, like today I'm going to talk about this particular thing. And sometimes it would branch out into other stuff, but usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201012\">it would stay around the same kind of theme. And I feel like it's now just sort of like general it's all like -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: Doesn't feel as discrete pieces anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I've noticed that a lot this week too. Like where it's kind of all connected. I mean, I guess it was always connected (chuckles) but it was more of a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: But I think the intensity of each independent incident made it hard to see what was underlying because I remember at one point you saying \"Can you help me kind of be consistent from one session to the next?\" because I think you felt like you were all over the place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: One day you would talk about this thing, one day you would talk about this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: And you needed some help to see where the connections were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: And it seems to me like now, I think you understand the process underneath each of the incidents that occur, or the different relationships, and seeing a similarity, and how do you get to see crisis points in relationships where you can either cut off from somebody or stall a relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">or confront the issue, whatever the issue is, and sometimes that brings you closer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: So I think you're starting to see that the thing that gets you to these different crisis points is maybe a similar pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: Sure, yeah. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: It doesn't feel so disconnected anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. (pause) But that also seems like a big deal, I think, because like in my head just thinking about it, it seemed like this labyrinth of like, I have no idea what I'm doing. (chuckles). At least now, I may not like a lot of things I guess, but at least I think I kind of get it a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">bit more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: (chuckles) So I don't know. It's been it's been new as well. And I did hear back from some more post-bacs. So I got rejected from UPenn, which was my top choice. Except apparently they rejected me like two months ago, and I never heard back from them. I've been checking my spam and my trash <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201251\">and everything obsessively, and I never found the e-mail. But I was rejected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">And then Vanderbilt put me on a hold. I was like \"Is that a waiting list?\" and they were like \"no.\" I was like \"So what is it?\" (chuckles) They said that it was like \"We couldn't make a decision on you so we're going to like\" it was basically like a pause. Like they're going to consider me at every <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201291\">meeting until they make a decision, which is kind of awkward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: And you don't get a chance to like influence their decision?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: So I asked, I said \"Can I send in something? Anything?\" They were like \"Well, yeah, I mean, some people send in letters of continued interest,\" so I did that. And then I was like \"Okay, and I'll send you another letter of recommendation,\" so I did. Because I know someone who writes in like 20 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D1\">minutes and they're awesome, so I asked him. So hopefully that will push them over the edge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: But it's still been like really tough like doing the whole up-in-the-air situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">THERAPIST: So are you waiting to hear back from anyone else still?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: Just Vanderbilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: I mentioned in the letter that they were my top choice out of all of the choices that I have. (laughter) But they're not really. They're kind of my only choice. I mean, it would be cool to be at Vanderbilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2013A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: That's okay. They don't need to know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: Right. (chuckles) But then I started before I heard all this, I just assumed I was rejected, and I was like I don't know if I should stay or if I should move to San Diego. (chuckles) San Diego specifically because they have like the UC San Diego is actually I was deciding between <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">Yale and the UC San Diego, which actually was like the toughest choice of my life. I ended up just like flipping a coin because I had no idea. So I've always kind of wanted to be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">The two professors that I have always wanted to work with are there, and I could do my post-bac there if I wanted to or whatever. But I hate San Diego. So that was like the big con or whatever. So I've been thinking about that too, but it's still so up in the air.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: You can't really make a decision until you hear back from Vanderbilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: Right now, yeah, now that that happened after. Because I needed more options and more complications, right? So I don't know. I don't know if I told you that my landlord is deciding not to renew our lease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: I think you mentioned that last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so actually Tim moved out already which was like, that's awful. So anyway, there's all this stuff going on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: When is that when is the lease up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: End of June. Yeah, so July 1st. We would have to be out by July 1st. I had no idea that most leases started in September, but apparently that's the case. And so I still feel like I'm holding on a rollercoaster. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's really hard. Just everything is so unsettled. You don't know where you're going or where you are even really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: Right. And then yeah. And people are like \"Well, do you want to be a professor?\" and I was like \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I want to be a professor\" and they're like this is Charles and Charles is like \"Well, that doesn't sound so sure\" and I'm like \"Well, I'm pretty sure. That sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201551\">sure to me.\" (chuckles) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: Why do you have to put the \"pretty\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: Well, because I don't think it's necessarily wise to be that sure about anything, you know? I think like I don't think that those people that say like \"Oh, if you could do anything else, do it. Never be a professor if you can think of being anything else.\" Like that just sounds like crap <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201591\">to me because you should be able to do other things, because if you can't then you're not going to be able to relate to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">I don't know. It just sounds like a cop-out to me. It sounds like a way of weeding people out as opposed to like encouraging people and I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Who has said that to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">CLIENT: Quite a lot of people, actually. I don't know. I think I like bring it out because of my background which I feel a little insecure about since being rejected to like most of the places. (chuckles) They're like \"Well, it sounds like you want to do other stuff\" and I'm like \"Why?\" \"Because you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201611\">did all this religion stuff\" and I'm like \"That makes no sense.\" (chuckles) And so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">THERAPIST: And for you, they're related. I remember talking about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: how you got to where you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">CLIENT: Right. And I still think they're related. I don't know that that's a very popular opinion but (chuckles) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: For you, they are related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Mysticism and religion and healing have been intertwined for centuries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: Right. (chuckles) For all of the centuries except for the last two. (chuckles) Okay. So, yeah, that's been kind of coming up too since all this I was talking to Charles and I was like \"What do I do? (chuckles) Like what would you do?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: Ah. And there's where to invite people to tell you that you're not sure enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, maybe. But I meant what would I do like I gave them the options. I was like \"Would you stay at Yale and do your post-bac here or would you go to San Diego and do it there?\" This was obviously before the Vanderbilt thing. And he and I think like it's cool because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201771\">sometimes I like to ask what people would do because like if he says \"Stay at New Haven\" and I'm like \"Oh God, that sounds awful\" then I'm like oh, that's what I want, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: Sort of noticing your response to what their choice would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I've kind of been having a hard time thinking about, you know, assuming I don't get into Vanderbilt, like what should I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">Because I kind of see the importance because I didn't have a Plan B before and I was like I don't know what to do. (chuckles) And I think it's important for me now to like have a Plan B. And I asked him, he and Angela [ph] both. Both of them said the same thing. They were like \"Oh, I would go to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F1\">San Diego\" and I was like, huh. And I don't really have -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">THERAPIST: And how did that sit with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">CLIENT: I don't know. Like I think it was weird because Susan [ph] came and we did tourist things, and it was all these beautiful things that I love about Providence. You know, I don't know, there's just so much I would miss from Providence. I really would. I guess Cranston, but like the area. I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201831\">really like San Diego that much as a city.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">THERAPIST: Have you lived there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">CLIENT: I've visited like a bunch of times, like maybe five or six times and I just like I don't know. There's something about it. Like I feel really unsafe because of like the way the architecture is. There's so many corners I don't know what it is. (chuckles) I'm like, I don't know, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201871\">like I'm getting mugged 24\/7.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">I think it's the corners, which is freaky, right? Like that's weird that that would bother me so much. I mean, we have corners here. (chuckles) I don't know what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if part of it is just familiarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: You've lived here, so it feels -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: But this was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">THERAPIST: But Providence is also a small city.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: It has a different feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">CLIENT: San Diego is like enormous, like so big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">THERAPIST: You're also really in New Haven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">CLIENT: I know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">THERAPIST: But the trail is in Providence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yes it is. Well part of it is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">THERAPIST: But once you move to the other side of the country -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">THERAPIST: they don't distinguish between New Haven, Cranston, Providence. It's all just Providence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">CLIENT: Right, right, right. Yes. And I was talking to my mom earlier and she just says Providence. \"Oh, she lives in Providence.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Everyone does but people from here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Who make a huge distinction between where the river is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No, my friend one time I said \"I'm from Providence\" to somebody and she's like \"No, you're not. You're from Cranston\" and I was like \"Okay.\" (laughter) \"I'm from Cranston. We make fluff [ph].\" (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">THERAPIST: (laughter) We're making the tape really hard to transcribe. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">CLIENT: Oh yes. (laughter) F-L-U-F. (laughter) No, so, but anyway, I've been trying to decide. I think part of one of the things that has been playing a factor is like I don't want to feel like I'm running away from all these things, and maybe it's time to like stay and figure out and try and like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">THERAPIST: What would you be running away from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">CLIENT: I don't know. Like this whole being lonely and not having friends and trying to start over. I mean, I have to move anyway. Maybe that's enough of a start-over, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">THERAPIST: What would make it different to establish a friend-group there versus here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">CLIENT: You mean in San Diego?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm. Or in Baltimore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, anywhere else. (chuckles) I don't know. I think something I know that I definitely want is like the newness of like like remember I was telling you the last time like that feeling of like I can be whoever I want. I can do whatever I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C9\">THERAPIST: And you need a new location for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB\">CLIENT: I think that's kind of what I'm trying to figure out. I don't know. I mean, part of it is the program. Like I don't necessarily think that the extension school and I mesh very well. But I think this is a more important consideration. I think it's playing a bigger role like whether or not I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB1\">to start over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Well, who would you want to be, different from who you feel like you are now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. (chuckles) That's a hard question. (pause) I think somebody not so insecure, you know? And I know that I wouldn't change inside but I think like the way that people perceive me. That would be a whole new start because they are whole new people. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">And it wouldn't be so messy because I don't know anyone in San Diego, and there's not anyone there to be like \"Oh my God, remember that one time in college when\" you know, whatever. (pause) Yeah, I don't know. That seems like really cool, but it also seems like very different, I think, from me now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201D31\">I really like the people that are here. I mean, I have like a handful of friends but they are really, really good friends, even though they're all moving. (chuckles) Which might be part of it, actually. So I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it's hard to be in the same place without some of the same things in place, whether they be friendships or routines, home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, routines like job, you know? (chuckles) (pause) Yeah. So then there's like all this going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB\">And then one of the things I considered was I have a standing invitation to teach at my old high school. To teach. And I was like well, I guess I could do that for a year. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DD\">THERAPIST: The look on your face as you say that shows me that that's not something you really want to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DF\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, I guess it's not. I mean, I really hated high school was the worst four years of my life. I hated it, and I don't think I would like to go back there. I mean, I guess it would be different to go back as an adult. I mean, I still know like half the teachers there. I'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201DF1\">bet I'd still be treated like a kid which, I mean, makes sense since they taught me. I don't know. And it's also like I would live at home which I think I can take for like a couple weeks at a time, but not long enough for that. I don't know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think paying attention to your gut responses and just seeing your automatic facial expression that came on your face as you thought about taking that option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E5\">It's nice to have a standing offer. They obviously think more highly of you than you felt of your experience in high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E7\">CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E9\">THERAPIST: But it's clear that that would not feel like a welcome opportunity really for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So maybe that one wasn't so up there. But I really do feel conflicted about whether or not I should stay, if like Plan B or whatever. I just don't know. And I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201ED\">THERAPIST: That's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF\">CLIENT: I just need to add that part of the reason I would want to stay is because there's this religious community that's forming and we meet I think it's tomorrow, actually that has been like so meaningful to me over the last couple of weeks. I've only gone twice because they have it every <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF1\">other week, but it's been like such a great thing. I'm going to be singing whenever I'm not sick, and it's really like intimate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">THERAPIST: How did this group get formed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">CLIENT: Somebody from school, actually, who was studying to get a masters. A religious group. And so he started this like it's kind of like a young adult group. But it's like so intimate and really like I don't know. Like really genuine and very open. People open up and it's such a great community, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201F51\">especially because it's so small. It's not like a big congregation. I don't know. That seems like something really special that I really don't want to let go of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like a nice forum for you to establish -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">THERAPIST: connections and really express this side of yourself that you aren't able to sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. And especially with all this stuff, all this stuff in flux and motion or whatever. Like I also have [these great] people in my spiritual life and I'm like, I have no idea what I'm doing. (chuckles) So this is like a really great way of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">THERAPIST: Yeah, having a place to explore that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">CLIENT: Yeah, or like be consistent. At the very least, have some sort of consistency which is I think what I want. (pause) So that would be something difficult to leave as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">CLIENT: Then again, there is a congregation at the University of San Diego. (chuckles) So I don't know. I just don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems like you have to keep all this in mind but wait also to hear from Vanderbilt first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">THERAPIST: And make whatever decisions need to be made at the time that they need to be made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20211\">THERAPIST: It's good to have Plan B in place because you felt pretty lost without a Plan B, but you can't enact or decide upon it until -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20213\">CLIENT: I guess, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20215\">THERAPIST: until you're at that step. You're jumping ahead a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20217\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20219\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021B\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like really your Plan B is decide whether or not you'd want to say in the area and use the extension school, or go to San Diego and use the extension school there and create a new space for yourself. But you don't have to pick that yet. The Plan B is picking.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2021A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) I think the only reason I was so afraid of that was because I did that for grad school and it was like oh, I'll just pick later, whenever I found out where I got in and whatever financial aid I get with it. And it was literally three months of daily \"What do I do?\" And I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D1\">I'm a little nervous of that so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F\">THERAPIST: Well, because you were trying to decide every day. The difference is not deciding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20221\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I guess, yeah. Yeah. (pause) So, yeah. I guess that's (chuckles) it in a nutshell. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20223\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20225\">THERAPIST: It's a lot to sit and process and hold onto every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20227\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20229\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you've actually been doing a really good job of taking things in as they come and addressing them sooner than you used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022D\">THERAPIST: There were a couple of big decision points where you addressed something that someone said or how they made you feel and you did, right away. So the decisions that could be made in the moment, you did, and the decisions that you can't make in the moment, you make when you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20231\">THERAPIST: When it comes to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) I guess yeah. (chuckles) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">The other thing that I wanted to tell you I don't know if I did or not but I was going skiing this whole winter. Like a couple of times over the winter. In terms of like body image or whatever, it was really tough to get like the men's boots because my feet are gigantic or whatever. But I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202371\">it was also really nice to do something that I really, really enjoyed even though I like kept falling. (chuckles) Like the first time I did it, I spent more than half the time on the floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">THERAPIST: I hear that's normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. But it's still, I don't know, it was really fun, and I think I actually went to buy a jacket or something, like outside wear or whatever, because I feel like I mean, you can obviously only do skiing in the winter but, I don't know, maybe there's other stuff I can do in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B1\">summer that would be fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like using your body -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20241\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20243\">THERAPIST: and feeling what it can do and teaching it to do new things is such a nice way to empower yourself, rather than judging your body for what it looks like or the shape that it has.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20245\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20247\">THERAPIST: Figuring out the things it can do is pretty powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20249\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024B\">THERAPIST: And pretty brave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I think that part of it was like, I don't want to buy those gigantic boots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024F\">THERAPIST: But they were fun to put yourself in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20251\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20253\">THERAPIST: I'm glad you set aside the discomfort of not having your feet be the size you want them to be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20255\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20257\">THERAPIST: and allowing yourself to do something with them that was actually pretty cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20259\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025B\">THERAPIST: So if you can think yeah, it's going to get a lot harder to ski, although I did see flurries today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025D\">CLIENT: Oh really? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20261\">THERAPIST: Yes. But finding something else to experiment with and letting yourself feel what your body can do is an amazing way to start to appreciate it and see it in a new way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20260-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20260-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100006\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20263\">CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. Yeah. It's been interesting, especially because I like, you know, I had to buy snow pants or whatever and that was really crappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20265\">THERAPIST: A tough hurdle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20267\">CLIENT: (chuckles) But yeah, I don't know. It was really fun, so maybe I'll do it again.
