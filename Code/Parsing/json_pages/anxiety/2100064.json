Suddenly that changed everything. So, I didn't have to fake it or feel pressure, or-it was an amazing show! People said it was like, I don't know, like they're getting better and better. It was awesome! It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">a really fun time. I felt good. All the new songs; I remembered all the lyrics. I felt comfortable. I couldn't even hear myself singing, but somehow I guess it sounded great. The energy was all good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: And it was a relief she wasn't there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, 'cause it's just all these things are just ways of dragging things out, I feel like. I think, maybe-I think she would have come. I think she gets that sense that this isn't working out. I've also been-I haven't been really texting. We're not really texting much and stuff. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">now I won't feel so bad if I just e-mail her because I've already explained everything, so I feel that it's just naturally kind of ending, kind of? Although I'm sure that she's going to be sore and upset with me. I'm sure. She probably already is. It must be the right thing to do because I feel a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">better-at least, for right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You said, specifically, that you felt relieved about not having to \"fake it\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Just, yeah. It sucks to not be able to have sex. That doesn't really like happen to me, really. Well, especially in this kind of way, where I'm almost like repulsed or something. I don't want to feel that way. She's a beautiful girl. It's not fair to her and it feels weird to me. I don't want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to go through all that; especially, because we haven't talked about it like the whole weekend. And I mean, like what are we doing? We're getting together and we're not discussing something kind of important, you know? Mostly because I think there's nothing to say. She's going to say the same things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">right? She's going to say, \"Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying never, but...\" You know what I mean? Then, what am I going to say? \"Well, yeah, right now you don't want a kid. I don't see why that would change a year from now when you're 38, 39.\" You know. So, yeah it was a relief. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(10 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I got an e-mail back from the school in Assyria! I told you, right, that one good friend of mine, and a good acquaintance-they're both Deans there? So, my friend Seth (sp?) he's a good friend of mine. We've known each other since we were like 15 or something. He's pretty scientifically minded, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">genius-like; did his Ph.D. in robotics and stuff, so he's the Dean of the Engineering school in Assyria. So, he's like, \"Yeah, send me more detail about what exactly you want to do, like duration...\" and this and that, \"and I'll definitely pass it along and talk to them.\" So, we'll see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(11 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Pedro (sp?), is that also, you have this show that goes really well, and you hear back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I think what it is, is it's what I was saying, right; that one thing. This is where I want to be. Unless I'm so madly in love and we're on the same page and we-you know what I mean? That's different, but other than that, I'd rather just hang out with Bethany (sp?) or people. Just meet chicks, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">or whatever, or not meet them. I don't fucking care. But this, I like this. You know what I mean? I suddenly feel-alright, I'm just living my life. Everything else is okay, you know what I mean? So, yeah, I feel very light.

I'm sure that next week, or the week after or something it's going to suck, but-The thing about Kelly is she's awesome! But I guess why I feel lighter is I like that it's dying down without further confrontation or whatever. You know what I mean? Like, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">she's kind of thought about it or-I mean she feels it (ph) I'm sure. I mean you take her boyfriend away for his birthday, and he's unable to have sex with you. It's, I'm sure... (8 second pause) But I guess I just feel maybe she won't-I don't know. Maybe we can salvage some kind of something, you know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">Then, I'm like, well, I'm still going to feel kind of douchey (sp) if I just e-mail her.

I'm just going to be like, \"If you want to call me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">of course, we can talk or whatever.\" It's hard enough as it is and I just you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">(15 second pause, long exhalation &amp; yawn) So, yeah...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">(23 second pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I wonder if some of your relief is like getting space from your mother.

Like I was literally disgusted when she was trying to kiss me and shit. It gives me the shivers to connect the two. I think there was something. Like I felt, like I was being molested or something. You know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I mean? It was weird. It was really weird. I guess because, yes, it's just timing wise. They're so conflated, I guess. And maybe because she is a mom. You know what I mean? Like, she's very-there's something. I don't know what it was, but that really did not feel good at all. It was really disturbing to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Well, even, just-it didn't used to feel that way with her, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Even just you've reached a point inside yourself where you didn't really want to be having sex with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And still were feeling like you had to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's an awful place to be.

Very pretty. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I think-I'm grateful in a way that she didn't come yesterday. You know. It would just-having her stay over.

I was so comfortable around <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">her. I'd feel wound up before, because it's like Kelly's in the back of my mind and I'm like holding this girl's hand and we kind of like hug, or we-It's like, what's up? What are we in high school? So, it felt very comfortable today. It's really good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">Other than the window thing. But even that, it's like whatever.

The drummer sounded better. We've got to work on the bass player. That's minor. That's only people that are so musically inclined they can pick up on certain rhythmical fucking things.

Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: You would say words like, \"I just want to be left alone.\" You even said, \"Maybe I won't do the show.

Yeah. Yeah. Because once I went to practice Wednesday, it was great. I think-that's what I don't want to do anymore. That's stuff just like terror (ph). It's distracting-big time distracting-and it's exhausting. Like, mentally, I just can't. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">myself now. Better and better, you know what I mean? It's either the real deal, so I don't care if I see her everyday because it's what I want, or it's just a good time and there's none of this, \"Well, I'm just suddenly in it and I've deloathed (ph) she's not as thin as I want, so I have to ignore that.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">She has a kid, I have to ignore that. She doesn't want a kid, I have to-No. Just someone more or less who's closer to what I want and then just take it from there. No more getting caught up in things that are just-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">And you really realize that more when everything else is good. In the past, things would get overlapped. Is this that I hate Brown and everything's fucked up? Or is it Samantha (ph)? Or, whatever, something. Money, or something? But, now it's like everything else I'm very content. It's just that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">keep getting exhausted by these, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: And when you get into something where you're feeling trapped again like trauma (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Trapped or projecting or moving too quickly. I think Kelly was the last of the Mohicans, hopefully, in that way hopefully. It was the healthiest thing I've had, but it was still initially-I was the one that got too serious in retrospect. Just after a month or whatever it was. I didn't tell her <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">I loved her, but didn't want to see other people and this. And I could have just not done any of that and kept it, you know. So, that's the final kind of, now I know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: And also, [are tacks] (ph) new for you. There's a lining (ph) I heard you say as clearly as you had in the past two weeks, that you'd want to get married and have children. Maybe not definitively, but that you might want to have that be a possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Again, it's not that you haven't alluded to that. There's something where you've just, you sounded clearer about the past (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: And it feels concrete. It's not some fantasy or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Right. You're actually picturing what that would look like and what that takes. And so it suddenly is even when you started dating Kelly, I don't think that was as concretely obvious to you about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Not at all. Not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: So you wouldn't have known that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: And I tried to tell her. Explain that to her, too. I'm working out so much shit here and it's happening so fast. That's a big factor in what's going on. It's a bit of a bummer, but it's also not. It's better to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It's better to know what you want than...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Nip it in the bud. That way we don't hate each other or, you know. And it is different. I guess that's a better way of saying it.

There's not that gray middle category that just sucks.

We just keep...tentatively I was supposed to go there Saturday to kind of... We're not doing that. I'm just going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">be like, \"Look. This is really hard. If nothing else we've got to take a break. Everything else is-Yeah, it is great. We get along so well. Everything's awesome, but something is not...

Like last night at the show, I could tell people-luckily this has always been the case when I've played music; with my first band. People really stop and focus; like they fucking listen. You know what I mean? Whatever it is about it, like, just they-That's a great <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">feeling. That's an excellent feeling. But, I think part of that is because I just feel-I mean, even it was happening before Kelly I think. The lyrics have gotten so, so better. And like, just everything. There's something. You know.

Kind of prioritizing differently. You know what I mean? I might hurt Tricia's feelings, or Molly's feelings, or Mom's feelings, or my Uncle's feelings. Who the fuck cares? I mean. It's way too much on that side of the spectrum. You don't want to hurt people's feelings, but if you already <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">know you're not an asshole to people. I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm a good person to people, so, to focus that much on what's she going to think, or what are they going to say, or uuggh.

Sometimes you pulled (ph) something that could get more specific into the more general.

You say, \"Yeah, it's just stress and tension.\" It sort of brings it up to the surface one more ota (ph) than-and who knows what it is, but I think-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: It could be to her; feeling more extricated from my mom. Yeah, it could very well be.

Maybe because I don't have anxiety attacks now, like that's, who knows. Yeah, I think it's just a combination of different things. Yeah, I think the stress-I mean it probably has a lot to do with it. If there are moments where I feel either I'm not more <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">in control as I should be about what's happening in my life, or you know, something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: [Perhaps just thinking that is it] (ph)  What's an itch?

Lately, this one, there will be like one intense scratch session where I just cannot <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">control how itchy it is; and I put some itch lotion on it, like Gold Bond or whatever. It's like, well, that's kind of odd. Like, I'm wearing jeans right now that are not very baggy. Shouldn't it be driving me crazy? It's not. Or at the show last night, I was sweaty and it was hot in there. I didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F32\">itch at all. You know what I mean, I think there's something.
