And it in part is a way of like thinking about what is going on in my life. So then I get here and it's a game of picking what things to actually talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">about, because there's finite time and more things than I could talk about. So that's some of why I never seem to know what to talk about when I show up here. [3:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Because there's a lot to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think. For whatever that's worth. So we talked some last time about you not being a wizard, or being a wizard or... So I... If I had to make a guess as to why you really were not okay with that description it would be that it seems like a case where I am turning you into some ideal projection <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">of a person, as opposed to like an actual person, and also giving you some set of like roles that you don't actually fill, or something like that. Is that anywhere close to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Well, I wouldn't say I wasn't okay with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I might have thought it was interesting to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Not okay feels like it has a different connotation. \"That's not okay. I'm not okay with that.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: [laughs] Okay. Fair enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: But I mean that-I don't mean to just sort of pick at words, I'm-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: No, no, no, I think-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: -I feel that's a big distinction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I think that's right. Yeah, I don't... You disagreed with that description. Is that closer to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I don't-yeah, I guess-I am not a wizard, that is true. So I disagree-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I [overtalk] the fact that I am a wizard. But I also want to know more about your experience of my being wizard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay. [5:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: So if that feels like it's in your experience, or sort of among the realm of possibility or ideas, then I certainly don't want to discourage that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Okay. Okay, that's interesting. [pause] Yeah, it's a very strange experience to talk about our conversations with you after they've happened, because we sort of leave some pieces of them differently. Even though we leave many pieces I think in similar places when we talk about them later. At <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">any rate, so I have a better formulation of why I think you're a wizard, so I'm going to share that with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">So Picasso describes art as a form of magic that mediates between the cruel world and ourselves. That's more or less his language. So... Okay, I see you have a lot of fairly modern art, so there's a... [pause] So a description of a shaman is someone who's like gone through the bad place and come out <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">the other side and has wisdom. It's in some sense like an equivalent of Plato's cave dweller who's come into the light and comes back, but without the like the people in the cave totally reject that person thing. So kind of one of the ways one gets to be a shaman is by doing a lot of drugs, but that's... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200392\">But there's this idea that one has to go through the negative experiences or the dark place in order to have access to some greater truth, or come back with some wisdom and share that with other people. [8:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561378\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I have no idea whether you have done that or been there, other than I know that you have a side to you which is itself probably some sort of dark place because it's got to be similar to a Ph.D., and I know a lot of people who have those or are working on them. But I do feel like you have a lot of insights <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">into the nature of people, and into my experiences, and presumably into the experience of others, or else you wouldn't have your own business where you do that. So it's in that context that I think wizard is a description of those traits, without weighing in on the shamanic aspect. So anyway. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">like that's a lot more defense of a little bit off-handed remark than maybe it was worth, but-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It's interesting, I was thinking back to your comment, your quote by Picasso, which is very interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I liked it. The Texas Museum of Fine Arts had a visiting Picasso exhibit and they put that on the wall as one of their quotes. It's a little bit hard to find the exact wording of it elsewhere, but it was something like that. [pause] Whether he said cruel or hostile, or both actually. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">kind of an interesting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess if there's one's self and the cruel world there better be something that mediates those two. [10:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: [pause] Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think that... that's a relatively simple way of explaining an enormous range of human actions and experiences. So yeah, I think it's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] [sneezes] Excuse me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: [pause] My undergraduate advisor was a funny guy in a straight-man sort of way. [You're aware? 12:01] that when one retires one gives a final lecture. And so the final lecture he gave was on myths of science. Which actually caused some outrage in the department, because one of the [assists?] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">said, \"Well, you can't call that a myth of science, it's not a myth.\" Unfortunately, if he'd like seen the talk he would have understood the word in a different sense, myth in the sense of like a thing that imbues the world with a higher reality, a way of explaining things that reveals rather than hides <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">truth, gets to the essence of a matter. Anyway. So I guess I worked for a long time with that guy, I feel that view of the world rubbed off a little bit of many of the things that we do-science or art or whatever-it has that function. [long pause, over one minute] [14:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">So I realized yesterday that I'm defending my dissertation in ten weeks, which means that I have to write my dissertation, or finish writing it. [pause] And also that it would probably be nice to have a job after that. So those things are weighing on me a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I would think so, yeah. We haven't talked in a couple of weeks about what you want to do when you're done. [15:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I'd sort of come to this place where I thought being a faculty member would be a good thing and something I might enjoy to do. [pause] I guess I'm less sure than I was when I decided that. But I don't have a lot of time to like reconsider infinitely, and I'm not sure that that would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">do any good anyway. And the next step on the path is to do a post-doc anyway, so it's not like... Yeah, so, and that requires sending out C.V.s and essentially applying to professors that I would want to work with. To which any of them that are interested are going to ask for letters of reference from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">my advisor and the rest of my thesis committee. So I asked my advisor to write a letter of reference for me. He likes me, and eventually will finish writing the letter, but he still hasn't finished writing the letter. Which I knew was going to happen Which is why I asked him for it before I sent out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200513\">the applications, because I have seen him not have a letter ready for students that he liked and it really can get close to be a problem in the job search process. [17:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561378\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">So like I'm in this position of waiting for him to do this thing that he's agreed to do and is willing to do but he isn't doing. I don't know why he hasn't done it yet, he had a-the grant that funds most of our research group was up for renewal, the application deadline was like yesterday. So I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">know why he didn't do it, but this has been-you know, I'm just a little frustrated by it. [pause] Yeah, I guess I'm not surprised at all about it, but I'm frustrated by it, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: It sounds like how you feel about Tanya. [18:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: [laughs] Doesn't it? Although there's some surprise there too, right. Like I guess was surprised to have [unclear 18:07] or something. [pause] You know, I feel like it becomes reasonable to wonder like are my feelings about Tanya coloring my judgment of this situation. On the other hand, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">it's just a frustrating situation, so I don't-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Why? How did you getWhen I said it sounds like how you feel about Tanya your mind went to, are my feelings about Tanya coloring this? I didn't-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I didn't-sorry, I didn't say you said that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But that was where your mind went, that's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, it's sort of like I said yes first, because yes I think that's right, I think there's a real similarity there. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: In a sense that implies that your experience, you're not only saying they're similar, but you're actually saying that like your experience with Tanya in this way of negative experience is essentially infiltrating the way you see other things. Right? That's kind of a version of what you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I'm wondering that, not saying it. But yeah. [pause] It's not a very testable hypothesis though, right, so I don't know what to do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Maybe, but it doesn't matter, because that's-your mind is making that kind of connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Versus other connections it could make. [20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Hm. [long pause] So we had a second session with Dr. Jannis, Monday I guess, so. I like him, Tanya likes him, I think he's good for us. So thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I have observed that-and others have concurred-that at the end of therapy sessions it's a sort of common practice to give a sort of wrap up, go-out-the-door-sort of thing to think about. Not that that's always done, but it's certainly a thing. So his sumTanya, \"Here's a thing that you can do <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">to make your lives better.\" This week was he suggested to Tanya that she could work to have a better sense of like how dire her situation is at any time. And I could-like I can't give a charitable description of it now, I'm sorry, but essentially I could work to be less frustrated in my life. Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">is... [laughter] ...incredibly frustrating advice, because it's not like I feel like I'm seeking out frustration in my life. You know, it's sort of the correct like macro level description of what I need to do, but it's... You know, I think his wording was closer to like \"identify things that you could <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F3\">make better,\" but even that is-it doesn't feel very different to me. It's sort of like, \"Here's the macro level problem, it has a like zero'th order approximation of how to solve it, figure out what's wrong and then solve it.\" Thank you. [sarcastically] So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561378\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: So that was extremely useful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, but here's the thing, right. Like I don't think that that-I find those sumTanya wrap ups amusing in most contexts, because sometimes they're very helpful and sometimes like there's a real powerful insight there. But I think there's also a... It's like when I go to church with Tanya, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">Episcopalians have this very set rhythm to the way they do their services, and it ends with a like send-you-out-into-the-world thing. Sort of a, you change what you say, but it's always got that like, \"And now take this out into the world and do it.\" And so I feel like there's a similar thing there <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">of like you have to say something in order for both parties to feel like it's been a therapy session or something. [23:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">I feel like I can't actually talk as much about this as I am now because I feel like when I talk about my feelings about this sort of thing it may perturb how you feel like you should handle me. But I'm not actually trying to say that you should handle me any different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: That is a... Well... That might be a projection, what you just said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Because I don't take what you say as directives. Or even implicit directives, or potential directives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: But maybe you takeBut I think maybe this is true, that you sort of take what you hear and try to make it a directive or an action plan at times. Like, \"What am I going to do with this? Or maybe this is because I should be something differently.\" I don't know. I certainly don't feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, but so if I said, you know, \"Dr. Jannis did this thing and I really hated it, I hate it when that thing is done in a therapy session,\" you wouldn't think, \"Do I do that thing?\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Maybe, but that's not what would be essential.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: (a) I would then think about, if I did do that thing, why was it difficult for you to talk to me directly about it? So then there was some anxiety about bringing it up directly, and that anxiety would be what I would focus on. [25:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And then I also would just be wondering about why you hate it, not that, \"Oh, I should not do that anymore.\" I should not do that anymore would not come to my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I would want to know why you're feeling the way you are. And maybe I'd do something differently, I don't know. But I wouldn't just sort of instantly think, \"Okay, I'm going to do this differently now.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Thanks, that's very interesting. [long pause] So I'm not particularly fussed by that, in the sense that like the session was still a very good one, and a few seconds of frustrating advice at the end doesn't alter a good session. But so I think the advice came out of a view that my general frustration <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">with my life situation, particularly as it relates to Tanya, colors my response to my small interactions with Tanya. So yeah. [pause] That's where my mind went between different sources of similar frustration. [27:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561378\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: There are a lot of things you're frustrated about, and that we I think should continue to talk about, maybe talk more about. Wizards are great because they can just undo your frustration because they're wizards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: They're awesome. When I think about your frustration in the most global sense it's like this is not how things were supposed to have turned out, this is not how things were supposed to be. And I don't really know what to do about that, but that is a fact, the fact that I have that feeling. [28:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: [pause] Yeah, I think that's really right. I sort of paused there at your choice of \"supposed to be,\" because I think that's a deliberate choice. Because it sort of speaks to me as having some ideal of what's going to happen. But I think there's also a sense of like expected, in addition to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">this is not what was supposed to be. This is not what I expected, this is not what I wanted. And those are other layers thatI guess part of that is to say that like, even if I didn't have this problem with something ideal not good, that issue, it's still not a good situation thing. If that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: How do you see the difference between supposed to be and expected? How do you distinguish those in your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: [pause] So you can sort of estimate the likelihood of any outcome. Not necessarily well. People are very bad at it, and I'm not good at it at all. We've talked about that at some length. But you have to think of the possibility in order to assign an expectation value to it. Like to have a probability <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">for it you have to have thought of it. And we're not really on a map that I knew existed in some sense, like thought I could end up here or something. So it's a little bit different then just like I feel like our lives were supposed to go this way, and like we had this goal and it was all going to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D2\">out in exactly this fashion. So like I don't even see the possibility that failing in this existed. Is that any sort of meaningful distinction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: [pause] Like what's supposed to be shapes the expectation? [31:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I'm not sure if that's what-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's right. So it's like you could pick like it was supposed to go this way, and that bounds you to expecting this range of outcomes, and we're outside of that range of outcomes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Well, I think the issue of frustration goes back to something I said a few weeks ago that you find very helpful, and I told you, you know, there's sort of two possible alternate outcomes. One is, you know, you make due with and maybe find joy in the aspects of your relationship with Tanya <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">and your outside life. Or you say this just simply is not enough of what I need-too much of what I don't need-and I'm going to part ways. Both of those mean that you've worked through a lot of frustration. Those are non-frustrated decisions. Those are decisions based on having worked through the frustration. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">And so to put it maybe the converse is, part of the reason that you're not able to go on one of those paths right now is because you're feeling so frustrated. But neither of those two are what they were supposed to be. Neither of those two should ever have been options anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561378\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: [pause] Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah, I think that's right. The last part, the part about not being able to go on either-the part where those being like not frustrated decisions I don't-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Well, you've moved beyond some level of frustration to being able to make that decision, I should say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: That they're not decisions made out of frustration. Those are post-frustration decisions, \"Okay, this is now what's available to me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right. [pause] How do I move from where I am to a place where that's possible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Well, we have a lot more to talk about in terms of your frustrations. Your disappointment and your disillusionment. Your anger. And you're angry at Tanya, you are angry with her. You're angry about her, you're angry with her. You're angry at the unfolding of your lives over the last year. [33:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [long pause] So there was a moment in the couples counseling session, Tanya sort of described the things that she thought I might be angry about. And then everyone sort of-both of them sort of like in a sense turned to look at me, \"Is that really-is that the case?\" And... [pause] <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">Yeah, there's a whole lot of complicated things going on in there. Because yeah, I still feel like my emotions can damage Tanya in ways that are like not controllable. Which obviously is true, I just said yes to you. Like I'm-you know, yes I am angry with Tanya, I'm angry about everything. I mean, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">have described how I feel. [pause] [36:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">I think I acknowledged that it was largely the case, but I didn't want to talk about it there. The only explanation that I have been able to come to since then is a feeling of like I am so angry that I don't feel like she gets to... [pause] I mean, I don't feel like she gets to just show back up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">have access to my deepest feelings. It's not how this works. Like relationships are built on some sort of trust and intimacy and so forth, and the sharing of feelings goes with that, it doesn't come with just like being in the hypothetical state of relation. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Were you able to say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: That last part? No, I've only just articulated that now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: That's a weird analogy, because I in no way feel that you experience Tanya as a parent. But the analogy that had is like some dad or mom taking off for a year or so, and then showing back up, \"Hi, I'm home!\" And you're supposed to be like, \"Oh, hi mom. Let's just be in a relationship now.\" [38:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think it's actually a really apt analogy, because I feel like that's been Tanya's experience of her own mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: And so maybe that's apt in a weird way, but like-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: It's very interesting. Certainly not by her design, but something somehow is being replicated from her own experience in your relationship together, in maybe an ironic way, but maybe not. She's not able to-even though she knows what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that she's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">able to identify that you've had that experience with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: You know, and I think I have mentioned... I think I have like pointed out that analogy before some months ago to her. [pause] Yeah, I said that in response to the last thing you said, now I've lost exactly why that seemed relevant, but... [long pause] So that sort of sent me towards thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">about like one of the difficulties in the whole thing is that like she doesn't remember a bad time because of the ECT. Like it's largely gone. [pause] So I don't think that analogy canMaybe that's the point, I'm not sure that analogy can like really be understood for her, because the part of her memories <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C72\">that she still more or less has access to has like-she was still trying. Because I think there's a, I don't know, useful description of the situation in which she turns into a different person when it's really bad. [41:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561378\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But she can understand that intellectually. I understand emotionally, but intellectually you can understand. If you have no memories of something you therefore sort of by definition cannot be there for other people in addition to your husband you are-you are not present. That is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">intellectually that I think she could understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Even if she can't understand what that experience might be. But then she might be able to understand that experience by virtue of trying to relate it to her own experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Right. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I was thinking-one of the things that you've talked about in terms of not wanting to disclose, it basically goes along with what you're saying now really, that you talk to her about your feelings because you're worried about them damaging her. And the other thing is, you don't have a right <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">to know how I feel. You know, you have a right to know that I'm angry. You thought you had given up those rights.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, certainly those are... When it's not one it's the other, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Or maybe it's both at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I think that's probably more accurate in a lot of cases. But then I feel like there's the question in my position of what do I do. Standing by either of those views perpetuates the problem in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Right. [43:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Like if she's saying, \"Well, I want to be there for you,\" and I just say no, well, she's still not there for me. But I'm not sure that's her fault at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Well, it's a process of the two of you talking about her knowing how hurt you feel, and how much you don't want to even share with her you're hurt because you feel so in a sense betrayed, and what the two of you can do about that. That's the kind of-that's the conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Hm. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And the conversation is, how do you build trust and what are each of your roles in that, because you both have a role. You have a role of gradually over time allowing yourself-if you want to, if you want to take this path-of taking baby steps to trust her, in response to your feeling that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">she is understanding you, understanding the extent to which you feel deeply betrayed, and really appreciating that on an emotional level and making efforts to create an environment where you feel you can trust her. So it's both of those parts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Hm. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: But in my mind that's the kind of dialog that needs to take place for you to move on in this relationship. [pause] This was-were actually not at least consciously intentional, but we do need to stop. So those were not intended to be parting words, but okay. [laughter] I will-or I may have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">asked you this already. Is it okay, and do you want me to talk to Dr. Jannis, sort of touch base with him?
