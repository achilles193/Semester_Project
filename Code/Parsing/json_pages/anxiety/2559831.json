(Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:15) I can figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. Good luck?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: (Laughter) And, you know, let me know what I can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: So we went to visit Kim (sp?) at the steakhouse yesterday. Took the kids to work with her. She kind of she suggested that\u2019s something that she thought would be nice. And that morning, she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m really not motivated to go to work.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou should take the kids in with you.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">(inaudible 00:48) a little bit rough. Like, (inaudible 00:58) very had been difficult, or things have been difficult for her. Whatever. Anyway. (inaudible 01:10) and he was like, \u201cNot really. (inaudible 01:22) was really fancy stuff and I don\u2019t like fancy stuff.\u201d Okay. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(inaudible 01:38) So I sort of thought a lot yesterday about what we talked about on Wednesday and then kind of put it all the way out of my head. (inaudible 01:59) I think what I came to was (pause) Yeah, I think you were clearly right that, like, I\u2019m saying this is how things always are and kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">of disavowing a lot of the ambiguity there, a lot of the \u201cno, this isn\u2019t how things always are.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about how much of that is coming from being angry. Well, it\u2019s one of those that is very hard to think about, which I feel like probably means that there\u2019s something there. (Laughter) You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">I kind of, like my mind sort of slides off it. I feel like in this case, a lot of it is so I think I got really scared by the fact that, like, none of the things that usually were to help me cope were working. (Pause) And maybe it\u2019s easier to say, \u201cThis is predictably always the case.\u201d And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">it\u2019s not always the case, but I don\u2019t really know why things get so bad some days and not so bad other days. And I don\u2019t have any way that I can (inaudible 03:43) to and make it different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">One thing I thought was interesting was that, like, so you\u2019re setting up the analogy. And, like, it would never have occurred to me to think that people who are talking about sports all the time when I wasn\u2019t interested were, like, being rude. Like, that, like, was yeah (inaudible 04:17) an echo of, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">like, \u201cOh, that makes sense.\u201d It was just like, \u201cWhat?\u201d You know. (Laughter) So I don\u2019t know. (Pause) Yeah, things have not been so hard the last couple of days, so that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter) But again, like, I don\u2019t know why. (Pause) This is where it\u2019s like most of it feels like most of the things that most of the, like, therapies that I was in in the hospital were very, like, coping, geared toward coping skills. Which makes sense. But this is where all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">that breaks down. Because I feel like I\u2019m actually pretty good at that part of it. Like, at saying, \u201cWhen I do this, this results. When I do this, this results.\u201d Like, what are the ways that I can change my environment to help my mood change. Like, I\u2019ve gotten to where that\u2019s sort of high on my priority <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">list. And it\u2019s something that I work on actively, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m not terrible. And then, sometimes, it just doesn\u2019t work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559831\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, probably most of what we talk about (inaudible 05:51). (Laughter) Exaggeration, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because, you know, if it does work, then I\u2019ll need to talk to you about it. (Laughter) I don\u2019t need to (inaudible 06:18) why on earth would I come in and say, \u201cThese are my small victories of the past two days\u201d? (Laughter) But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 06:42) it can still make you feel like such a failure or so incompetent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, and also angry at everybody else who, you know both the people for whom, like, once they learn how to use coping skills, like, that actually fixes things. I\u2019m not sure if those people exist, but people certainly talk like those people exist. Yeah, I guess I feel like I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">like I\u2019m being set up to believe that when these things fail for me, that means that I am a failure. And part of me sees that and is pissed off about that, and part of me believes that, you know. Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">I don\u2019t ever actually clean my glasses. I just wipe them on my shirt, whichever shirt I\u2019m wearing, which leaves to never having (inaudible 08:04) glasses. (Pause) Yeah. I feel like I\u2019ve failed, and I feel like I like, I feel like there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with me. Like I\u2019m deformed in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">some way or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">James and I talked today about he just asked me, like, how much I was talking with people about the ECT. Well, you know, it sort of depends on the day and who I\u2019m talking to, but actually, kind of a lot. Which led into, you know, conversation about, like, is there stigma and a surrounding mental illness, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">and what does it look like? So on and so forth. Like I had somewhere I was heading, and I don\u2019t remember. (Pause) Oh, yeah. I think I guess I don\u2019t think this is a very new thought, but it\u2019s something like undeserved suffering scares the shit out of people. How do they deal with it, you know. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">guess I mostly see that argument made in talking about, like, sexual harassment, rape and, like, blaming the victim. A lot of my Facebook friends well, I feel like most of my friends are feminists, but a lot of my Facebook friends are, like, you know, ardent readers of Jezebel, and so I end up reading <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">a lot about it. [And I sort of] (ph) go back and forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">It scares me, a lot. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t (pause) it scares me when I don\u2019t feel like I have done something to deserve what\u2019s happening to me. So that\u2019s, yeah (ph). It scares me less when, you know, things get to be okay again and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done anything to deserve that either. Somehow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">I sort of gloss over that. (Laughter) Or think about it less. Or, yeah. You know, that\u2019s not really something I can, like, talk to people about because this sort of knee-jerk response of, like, \u201cWell, of course you\u2019ve done things to get better for yourself.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cGood for you. You should be proud <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">of this.\u201d Like, well, yeah, I am very proud of a lot of things. But sometimes, like (ph), sometimes it just happens or it feels like it just happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">Yeah. Maybe if I look at it too closely while I\u2019m doing well, then that\u2019ll make it go away. So we walked down to the local square to get spices. (inaudible 13:34) and, you know, on the way back, there\u2019s beer there\u2019s a bar, and it had some of the signs outside. And it said, like, \u201cGood news, ladies. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">All of our male bar staff is single.\u201d And I, like, laughed, and then I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of sexual harassment.\u201d And I (ph) was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And so I talked to James about it. And it\u2019s like, well, I you know, I sort of think it\u2019s funny and I want to think it\u2019s funny but, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">no, I can\u2019t let go of seeing it as kind of creepy. Which (ph), you know, James can let go of those things. And I think he, you know, occasionally gives me a hard time about not being able to let go of that. Well, [that\u2019s so] (ph) because, you know, he certainly knows it\u2019s really not okay. But I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">really sure [the connection is there (ph). Some thing is, like, sometimes I just, you know, like, want to be able to laugh at the joke or, like, listen to the song without that (ph) it\u2019s coming on every single radio station without (inaudible 15:13) actually, that\u2019s really kind of a song about date <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200354\">rape, and that\u2019s probably not okay. Yeah. But I also, like, don\u2019t want to be, full of rage and exhausted and bitter by all of these things that hit you every, you know, every hour of the day. [So I don\u2019t] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559831\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">I told you about the (inaudible 16:38).

(inaudible 17:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Or, like, earning a PhD in theology really helped in get in touch with his rage.

And (ph) some things, it\u2019s like I have to sort of step back from me being angry about just because, like, it will make me less than I want to be or make me less of myself than I want to be. Like, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">just exhausting and (pause) I don\u2019t know. It just has to be done. I guess I\u2019m thinking mostly about, like, feminism right now. Yeah, that\u2019s (inaudible 19:24) being angry about it. It gets to where it hurts me rather than helps me. And then some things, I (pause) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like it\u2019s unbearable <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">to consider myself as somebody who\u2019s angry about things.

(Pause) I sort of, like, recognize that that\u2019s also your job and, you know, it\u2019s not my job to be able to fix all of my problems myself. But I\u2019m not very good at that.

That comes in various ways. Like (inaudible 32:02) people do this bullshit thing why they find some reason why something awful shouldn\u2019t have happened. Or find <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">some reason. Yeah, that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Find something awful should not have happened or should not have happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Might not have happened. Or it happened because of this, see. So obviously, if that had been different or if you had done this, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think (inaudible 32:26).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a (inaudible 32:30).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. (Laughter) And you were saying, like, \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, and that\u2019s defensive.\u201d I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: And (pause) it sort of seems like (inaudible 33:01) you and James, where on one hand, you want to be able to, like, let go of stuff that makes you angry, just because you [don\u2019t want to be] (ph) burdened by it when you\u2019re just walking down the street, having a nice time (inaudible 33:13). <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">At the same time, like, he\u2019s not going to be the one to tell you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559831\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: (Laughter) Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: About why you should or shouldn\u2019t do that.

Like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how (ph) you do so much with me.

But it also occurs to me (inaudible 34:55). So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: By pointing it out, you make it okay for me to acknowledge? Sorry.

(Crosstalk 35:11) really bad with James (crosstalk 35:12). (Laughter) I don\u2019t think that would be (laughter).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: What I was thinking was, like, (inaudible 35:28) like a bad depression (inaudible 35:32) sort of doing a, like, postmortem of what happened and why you\u2019re depressed and sort of doing everything (inaudible 35:40) well, I guess that just happens sometimes. Like, that sounds like me, you know. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but in some sense, like, the last thing (inaudible 35:54). (Laughter) (inaudible 35:59) what happened. And I\u2019m like, the thing which you didn\u2019t think was really pushing your buttons was. (inaudible 36:07) you know. Like, whatever. So I guess that makes me wonder if there <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">were things that could (inaudible 36:17) pointed to you in my direction, without really realizing it. That, I think, actually was the point where you pause and forgot your thought a few minutes ago. But anyway -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Which direction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Like (pause) I wonder if it\u2019s (inaudible 36:42) but, like, you know, sometimes people concoct all these stories about why, you know, depression happens and what the logic is (inaudible 36:52) this and that because they don\u2019t want to see just bad things happen. (Laughter) I don\u2019t know if that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">was (inaudible 37:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I know you consciously did not intend that, but I wonder if that example of a sort of (inaudible 37:15) that might have been making you anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so because, like, I associate you both with, you know, taking everything to pieces and also with saying, like, \u201cNo, sometimes bad things just happen and, like, what we do is figure out how to deal with that.\u201d So, yeah, I don\u2019t I have trouble knowing what to do and what to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">when, like, you know, you kind of put forward ideas, and then I don\u2019t know what to do when I feel like they\u2019re wrong or when I feel like they don\u2019t fit. Because, like, sometimes I sit with them a while and then they turn out to fit pretty well and that\u2019s, you know, hard to handle. And sometimes they <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">still don\u2019t fit, and that\u2019s also hard to handle. And I don\u2019t (pause) it\u2019s like both really are important to me to trust my own judgment in this and also really sort of I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s increasingly hard, but it\u2019s pretty hard at this point. And so, (pause) yeah. I don\u2019t know what to do. It ends <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A73\">up being more or less useful because I sort of fret about it for a while, and then I end up thinking about it pretty hard, and that\u2019s also (ph) useful. But (pause) yeah, I mean, I think there\u2019s also (pause), like, I feel guilty (inaudible 39:17) like you are mistaken. [I don\u2019t know] (ph).
