Cool skirt. I\u2019m in a bit of shock right now from my friend \u2013 incredible shock, actually. George (sp?). We\u2019re the type that every other day we\u2019ll text. We keep tabs. I haven\u2019t heard from him. He wasn\u2019t getting back to me. I wondered what was going on. I know they\u2019re stressed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">because they\u2019re probably going to go out of business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I remember you saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So I know there is that and I know there are some issues with his wife, but I still thought it was weird, though, to not take a second to e-mail. You know how I am \u2013 then I started wondering is he upset with me? I owe him $400; he helped me with my car and all of that. I haven\u2019t been able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">pay him, so I was like, \u201cFuck. What is going on?\u201d  So I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything, but I\u2019m going to give him at least something to just tell him that it\u2019s on my mind,\u201d so I gave him everything, basically, that was in my bank account. But as soon as I got there I realized that wasn\u2019t the issue <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">at all. I went down and gave it to him and was like, \u201cMan, I\u2019m really sorry. It\u2019s been on my mind. Times have been tough.\u201d I could tell something else was going on. He\u2019s like, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody. Nobody knows \u2013 my brother doesn\u2019t; nobody knows.\u201d His wife is now claiming that she\u2019s been getting phone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">calls from someone, an anonymous blocked number, telling her that he\u2019s having an affair. This is on top of some issues; it\u2019s a very long story not worth getting into. Let me just say that he\u2019s been incredibly generous with her family. They\u2019re from Cairo and all that.  Her sister was here, who is a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">nutty. He fucking let her work at their place and put up with her \u2013 a lot. They\u2019re heavy; and not heavy like my mom, like nutty. There\u2019 something really nutty about these people. They live in his house. The guy works like 14 hours \u2013 he doesn\u2019t even have time for an affair. I am just shocked because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">I really thought of her not that way. She did seem always a little bit negative and a little bit heavy, but a sympathetic person. I don\u2019t know. I worry for him because he\u2019s . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Did someone actually call? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I told him that. I was like, \u201cDude, how do you even know somebody called?\u201d because she\u2019s been so nutty. What happened with the sister, it just got bad and his wife just doesn\u2019t get it. She works at fucking one of the big hospitals. You don\u2019t know that your sister is a nut job so you\u2019re blaming <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">your husband? Just weird shit. There is just some very basic \u2013 your husband is giving this broad a job. I would never do it. I knew it was going to end badly. That\u2019s one thing I told him. I was like, \u201cDude, is this a good idea? She\u2019s a nice girl, but she has issues and now she\u2019s going to be there all <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">day and it\u2019s your wife\u2019s sister.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what happened. The wife won\u2019t let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s insisting she did get an actual phone call?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Obviously she doesn\u2019t have any idea about who?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s anonymous.

I don\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. I love Francine, but . . . \u201c This has gotten so out of control now the last several months. I was like, \u201cHow do you even know there was that phone call? How do you know?\u201d And he was like, \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m hiring the best attorney. I\u2019m going to subpoena all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">this shit. I want to know who is calling her phone.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, you already had a shitty breakup one time years ago . . . \u201c with his son\u2019s mom and all that. What is happening? I was like, \u201cYour business \u2013 you already have so much to stress about. I\u2019m really shocked that she doesn\u2019t have the sympathy.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t get people. I don\u2019t. The parents live there.  She lives there. The sisters came over. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m shocked. I\u2019m absolutely shocked and I told him, \u201cDude, I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d Not to sound catastrophic, but that stuff eats away at you. You\u2019re losing your business \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">that\u2019s his life. That\u2019s their income. That\u2019s it. What is George \u2013 early 50\u2019s? I feel bad. Anyway. So on the one hand, first I was relieved. Everything was totally fine. I gave him the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I think this is on. The heat. I can turn it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: No, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s okay. Thank you.  So I went from being totally relieved to the minute I saw him and gave him the money, he seemed so distracted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You were kind of worrying about him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: He was totally like, \u201cHow much is this? What? What? Okay.\u201d (pause) I don\u2019t know. And I just feel bad because he just seems to have this weird . . . It was really awful with the first woman. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a player or a dater \u2013 two in a row of just cluster fucks. Unbelievable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: So you know for sure that he\u2019s not having an affair? It\u2019s obvious to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I mean, there is no way for me to know that, right? But I also know the hours he works and his schedule and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t fit in his life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how he would have . . . He\u2019s not the type to stay after work and go home really late. He smokes a joint and he\u2019s tired. His routine is set. Now, is it possible that he kind of did what I did in London? Maybe there was some texting going on, maybe some flirting, maybe he\u2019s on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">cusp of something. That might be possible but, you know what? Even if he was cheating on her, at this point I wouldn\u2019t even blame him. This is such a cluster \u2013 and I\u2019ve always wondered, even before these few months, something is just off kilter with her. He shouldn\u2019t be cheating. I\u2019m just saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve been worried about him in this relationship anyway a fair amount. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, because it doesn\u2019t make sense for someone to have a great job at a great Darien hospital. They have a three-family home. Do you know what I mean? You have a nice fucking home, your husband has a business, you don\u2019t live in fucking Bum-fuck Cairo, where any day now it\u2019s all going to fall <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">apart because of what\u2019s happening, and all you do is complain? \u201cAmerica sucks. This sucks. That sucks. Americans are racist.\u201d She generalizes everything. Dude, you can\u2019t keep saying that. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cI can criticize my mom, but you can\u2019t.\u201d Do you know what I mean? That bothers me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561570\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">I\u2019m still a proud American. There are things about this country (chuckles) I fucking love. We are awesome. We\u2019re built on ideas that are amazing and most people are good people for the most part, people trying to do their best. If you want to criticize the government and other things, corporations \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">fine, but you can\u2019t just go around saying general things like \u201cAmerican\u2019s are racist.\u201d  Racist? Have you been to Berlin or other places where \u2013 forget about black. That\u2019s not George. George just wants to smoke a joint, tell jokes, kick up his feet, laugh his ass off, he doesn\u2019t want to talk about heavy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">shit all day long. She\u2019ll talk about illness and just very heavy, very heavy. How romantic could that be? And this is going on now seven years. I don\u2019t mean to just go on about that, but he just dropped me off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: It means something for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: These people are family and this kind of shit \u2013 it could be George; it could be Mike. This shit drives me crazy because it\u2019s like these are people.  They\u2019re not perfect, but I know what these people have done for me. I see how they treat others. I see the things they go through. Are you kidding <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">me? They guy didn\u2019t think twice. I told him, \u201cDude, I\u2019m having a . . .\u201d Boom, he just gave me the money. Or anything \u2013 not just me, but plenty of our friends. We\u2019ve been there for him, too, but that\u2019s the kind of people these are. It\u2019s like what the fuck? Also to her because I always call her my sister. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">It\u2019s just disappointing all around, very, very disappointing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it reminds you of your parents, your mother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: No. My mom would never, ever, never, never, never.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Blaming and criticizing and paranoid. That sounds like your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: But this level? No way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Not to this level. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: No, no, no. And my mom, no matter what, would never ever \u2013 even to me. I could marry a black girl tomorrow. She will go through the roof. It will be insane, but she will never\u2026This is a betrayal. What\u2019s going on here is an out and out betrayal and just out and out lies. It\u2019s not seeing basic <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">facts. My mom would never turn on me that way or my dad. She wouldn\u2019t . I know that much. It would be shitty. There would be bad blood. A lot of bad things would happen, but she would never, ever pull shit like that. She just wouldn\u2019t. Or at least if she were to say that Americans were racist, she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">immediately kind of catch herself and be like, \u201cWell, I mean \u2013 you know \u2013 I\u2019m sure there are some nice ones.\u201d  She\u2019ll try to temper something. Or if she says that and if I said, \u201cI\u2019m an American. Am I racist?\u201d And then she\u2019ll be like, \u201cWell, no. Yeah, you\u2019re right. There are good people in every group.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200533\">Something. But this woman won\u2019t let up. She won\u2019t let up. (pause) I think it\u2019s almost the opposite. I think of these guys like brotherly or fatherly figures, so in that way I really worry for them like I would for my dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That way. Yes, that is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean, identifying . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think of her like my mom, but I do think of them like my uncle. I worry for my uncle. Yeah, there are things we don\u2019t see eye to eye on, but he\u2019s my uncle. I love him. He\u2019s been there for me my whole life.  I know that I could call him at any time if there was a real thing and he would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">be there. The guy has diabetes; he looks like a broken man. It\u2019s like a king living in a shell of a \u2013 do you know what I mean? So I worry. I worry because it just doesn\u2019t seem right. It just doesn\u2019t seem right. Moving on, the other thing that happened was yesterday I went to see this jazz guy at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">bar, this Assyrian kid. He\u2019s 25 or 24. He\u2019s a world-renowned \u2013 forget Assyrian stuff. This guy is a truly world-class, almost like an idiot savant jazz guy. It\u2019s pretty amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561570\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What does he play?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: He\u2019s a jazz pianist. It\u2019s almost like at this point there is a tradition in Assyrian jazz and classical music of taking Assyrian melodies, these beautiful folk melodies, and jazzifying them, but he\u2019s the first one that\u2019s doing it truly in a world-class way. Everyone else that does it, it\u2019s good, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">but it\u2019s almost like a novelty. This guy, at first it will sound a little bit like a novelty, but them it just goes to places that are \u2013 I mean this is serious business, however the one thing that happened yesterday was I was really sitting there fighting the feeling I get of just feeling angry, I felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">sad, I felt annoyed. I was kind of like mother fucker, man. Honestly, those were all things I was doing when I was 17, before this kid was born. I would be sitting there. I was doing all that shit \u2013 weird sound effects and taking Assyrian things and blending.  It\u2019s hard. That\u2019s a hard one. I tried. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F3\">Good for him. It\u2019s not a jealousy thing, it\u2019s just . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Well sure it is. That\u2019s a pretty normal feeling that can be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it was jealousy. Honestly. I don\u2019t know. The jealousy I do feel is with Indian bands. That I do, like when I see a radio ad I just can\u2019t help it. One-tenth \u2013 all I want is one-tenth of that recognition and a little bit of an ability to get your music out there more and be heard <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">and play better shows. But this \u2013 maybe I did a little bit, but it was more that . . . Yeah, maybe it\u2019s a different kind of jealousy. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: More than what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Because it was also the Assyrian thing. There were a lot of Assyrians there and they\u2019re so fucking excited that I don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t come to my shows because it\u2019s not really Assyrian whatever.  I realize that\u2019s really an issue with me. I want some recognition. Like that poetry event. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">was such a big deal because I\u2019m busting my ass over here and everything I do I carry part of my culture with me. So yeah, it\u2019s just a lot of mixed emotions. There were moments when I just let it go and I just tried to get into it. Other moments I just felt annoyed. It was a bit of a roller coaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: How could you not have feelings watching that? You get so self-critical of having a roller coaster of feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: No, not self-critical. It was just a bummer. It was just sad. It was like just another moment. I was like, \u201cAll right. Well, this is what\u2019s happening right now. I\u2019m sad because there is a lot to be sad about.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It is sad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: But then I tried \u2013 I don\u2019t mean like I tried to negate it. I just think it\u2019s good to be healthy and take a breath and not catastrophize it a little bit, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561570\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Is that happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: No \u2013 well, it could have if I didn\u2019t stop. In that case, it almost could have a little bit, but finally I was like \u201cyou know what?\u201d I kind of just took a step back a little bit. Also, a lot of this just isn\u2019t that good. This guy, when he\u2019s on that piano, beautiful, absolutely beautiful, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">he was doing all this synth stuff, synthesizers and this and that. A lot of the beats they were doing were almost like heavy-metal-ish. He was bringing that into it and I get that that\u2019s maybe a novelty or something, but it was very bombastic, some of it, so in a way I was able to just remove and, as <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">an artist, be able to be like \u201cwell, he\u2019s a kid.\u201d And I\u2019m also not going to overly-criticize him.  I\u2019m not going to project my shit and be all critical of him. He\u2019s incredibly fucking talented. He\u2019s also a kid and he\u2019s got all this recognition and he\u2019s playing with toys and these are phases. Good for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200733\">him. Why not? He\u2019s at the bar doing whacky things that a lot of these people don\u2019t see at the bar and that\u2019s awesome; but I\u2019m also not going to do a lot of what these Assyrians are doing and just kiss his ass like it\u2019s Jesus\u2019s second coming. Afterwards I was like, \u201cHe\u2019s really, really talented.\u201d There <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200734\">is a lot of stuff that\u2019s derivative. It\u2019s like he just discovered Radiohead and System of the Down. A lot of the stuff he\u2019s doing is not particularly interesting to me, but I can see how in the jazz world . . . He\u2019s young; he\u2019s super excited; when he plays he kind of stands up and he gets all revved <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200735\">up. Yeah. I can see it.  And when he plays just the piano and reins it in, it\u2019s genius. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful. So in that way I was able to not get swept away into this . . . But I felt annoyed. I just felt like any Assyrian thing, they just rally around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the part that sounds like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not him. I\u2019m happy for him. I was looking forward to seeing him. He\u2019s good. He would be playing jazz and the minute he would start playing a little Assyrian melody they\u2019d be \u201cwhoooo.\u201d It\u2019s like shut the fuck up. You\u2019re so . . . On the one hand, I want that recognition for myself; but on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">the other hand it annoyed me. I\u2019m like are you so insecure and so dumb? Basically you wouldn\u2019t be here. This guy is an amazing jazz musician and you wouldn\u2019t fucking be here if he didn\u2019t put those little Assyrian things in there.  Every second you\u2019re whooping and hollering because he did some little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">Assyrian thing. That is nice. It\u2019s beautiful, but calm the fuck down. It brings up very mixed feelings for me. I\u2019ve always hated that kind of nationalist rah-rah-rah crap, but I\u2019ve also wanted those people to give me some real recognition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: Maybe what is frustrating watching it is that, in a way, that\u2019s what they\u2019re cheering for. It is different than recognizing him as an artist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: What they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re recognizing . . . Yeah, they think he\u2019s a genius and all that . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: But they\u2019re co-opting it for their own needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. The same as System of the Down, right? Good for them and I am proud of them. Do you know who I\u2019m talking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: I\u2019m proud of them. That is great and it is definitely different for heavy metal. Good for them. I can see some of the beauty.  They\u2019re integrating these whacky Assyrian melodies in this crazy heavy metal, but I\u2019m not going to go to their concert and I\u2019m not going to act like I\u2019m a fan; and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">what they do. They just can\u2019t get enough. I\u2019m like dude, do you realize if you guys saw them walking down the street and you didn\u2019t know who the fuck they were, you would immediately be saying, \u201cLook at these fucking freaks.\u201d That\u2019s unnerving to me. I can\u2019t stand that shit. And yet, I want those people <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">to also give me some.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561570\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well when that\u2019s all there is to go around, it\u2019s better to have some of that than nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: Very true. Very true. It\u2019s not like there is a real Assyrian literat\u00e9. People like me are just dispersed and not really connected and, like me, they end up kind of under the radar and more alienated and isolated.  (pause) It was awesome, though. One really cool thing that happened was we got <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">there and, of course, there were a bunch of Assyrians who I know and I don\u2019t really feel like seeing. One of them \u2013 do you know that palce in Cheshire? This guy built this huge nut business, gourmet nuts. His family was already loaded. They already have a shitload of money. Okay, fine. His wife is a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">lovely person and this guy is like a big, lumbering, fifth-grader. He\u2019s good at business, I guess, but he\u2019ll just say stupid shit. He\u2019ll kind of needle people \u2013 just like a fifth grader, making fun in a weird way or saying inappropriate things.  One of the things he\u2019s been doing to me lately is he\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200873\">see me and be like, \u201cHey, doctor. You\u2019re not like a body doctor, you\u2019re like a head doctor.\u201d But there\u2019s always like \u2013 what are you trying to say, dude? Like when I got into Harvard he would be like, \u201cHey, so we heard you\u2019re going to Harvard now.\u201d So the subtitle is always something like \u201cyou think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200874\">you\u2019re better than me\u201d or \u201cwho do you think you are?\u201d Something. So we walk in yesterday and we\u2019re going to our table and he says that again, \u201cdoctor\u201d or whatever. I literally slowed down and in Assyrian I said, \u201cDoctor moctor \u2013 I don\u2019t give a fuck, man,\u201d (laughs) and just kept going. And it felt so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200875\">good. It felt so awesome because I really didn\u2019t give a fuck and it didn\u2019t affect me. I wasn\u2019t upset. It just felt good to just basically tell him to shut the fuck up. (laughs) That was nice. Then, of course, afterwards he was like, \u201cSo how are you doing? How is everything going?\u201d just like a kid.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200876\">You scold a kid and then they\u2019re like, \u201cClaire, do you want some of my iced coffee?\u201d And, of course, he was doing it to others. It\u2019s not me. He was making fun of my friends. He\u2019s just a lumbering whack job, but it was pretty funny. I felt good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: It was the same kind of thing you\u2019re responding to. Doctor becomes this thing to admire and also then to devalue [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:29). It had nothing to do with you. It has [ ].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: My friend, Xavier, he\u2019s a good Assyrian kid. We were talking and he doesn\u2019t know Assyrian. He was like, \u201cHow do you say \u2013 what\u2019s the phrase \u2013 tides lift the boats?\u201d What is that phrase like your success is my success?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s familiar to me, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: I was like, \u201cXavier, you know what? I don\u2019t think that phrase exists because we don\u2019t do that.\u201d We don\u2019t do that. Our culture doesn\u2019t do that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561570\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s more like your tide makes me feel like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: Your tide makes me feel like I\u2019m drowning. (pause) In that way, though, I\u2019m very lucky that I have these friends. I have more than a handful of friends who aren\u2019t like that, both Assyrian and non-Assyrian, so in that way I\u2019m very fortunate. But as an artist, it\u2019s hard to swallow when you feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">like dude, you guys, right under your nose you have an Assyrian, home-grown kid that, out of my own volition, I do stuff, whether you think so or not. Even in the Indie stuff. They don\u2019t realize it, but there are Assyrian melodies that I don\u2019t even know. I catch them later and I\u2019m like \u2013 whoa \u2013 that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200932\">thing I\u2019m doing on the guitar is \u2013 that\u2019s weird.  Or the time signatures or whatever. Just because I\u2019m not singing Assyrian or because it\u2019s not clearly an Assyrian thing \u2013 and I have an Assyrian base player. We\u2019re even half Assyrian, the band \u2013 we just happen to be that way. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200933\">a schitzo thing. I both want that recognition and I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: You want recognition, right? Pure recognition. You don\u2019t want to be recognized only because you\u2019re doing something that narcissistically gratifies their needs. An Assyrian melody sort of makes them feel more important. It\u2019s different than seeing you and appreciating and admiring your artistry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">no matter what you\u2019re playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Which my non-Assyrian friends do. That\u2019s the bummer. That\u2019s the real bummer. It\u2019s not the bummer, but it\u2019s a bummer that it\u2019s so one-sided. There are very few of my Assyrian friends that really get it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure even whoever you went to see at Regattabar, it can ring shallow, that kind of applause that\u2019s only based on hearing exactly what I need to hear to make me feel better about me. It\u2019s not actual recognition. It feels like being puffed up a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: I even said \u2013 one of the things I said was, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s a kid. He\u2019s also not stupid. A lot of this stuff he\u2019s doing he knows that there is a market for that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Right. Then you become a kind of [Philipcer monkey] (ph?). This is what I have to do, sell my soul in order to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Exactly. Yep. And that\u2019s great. Good for him. Hopefully he\u2019ll outgrow that because he\u2019s truly a world-class . . . The write-ups he gets, he\u2019s being compared to the top of the top, and that\u2019s awesome. So hopefully he\u2019s getting this shit out of his system, kind of.  (pause) Also it\u2019s inspirational. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">That\u2019s the other thing. I think that\u2019s better these days. I just stop and I\u2019m like, \u201cI actually am doing a lot.\u201d We auditioned a fifth member for the band to do electronics. That\u2019s stuff I want. I hear that shit in my head, but I can\u2019t play the guitar, sing and do that, so there is a lot of stuff. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F2\">band sounds great. A lot of the new songs I\u2019ve written the last year do have some Assyrian. I started mixing Assyrian. My Assyrian is not strong enough to write poetry in Assyrian, but I realize I can actually write lyrics in Assyrian, especially for pop songs because they don\u2019t have to be . . .  And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F3\">that\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019ve been able to mix English and Assyrian and I do like that a lot. In other words, once I stop and think about it, I am doing a lot. (chuckles) Just because there isn\u2019t this artificial applause and whatever, that has nothing to do with your art. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561570\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s striking how quickly you can forget what you are doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do. Of course, that\u2019s been my problem all along.

Yeah, I\u2019ve not done anything.  (pause) Because it\u2019s that voice, \u201cDude, you\u2019re so stupid. How come you don\u2019t know how to use all those electronic gadgets? What the fuck is the matter with you?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Wow. Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s a passing thought, but yes, of course. It\u2019s like, \u201cDude, you were doing that when you were 17. How could you have not kept up with that and learned? It\u2019s not rocket science. How did you not learn to use these gadgets and just record yourself at home? You could be making record after <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB1\">record in your fucking bedroom?\u201d But now I\u2019m able to stop and say, \u201cWell, first of all, I am. I just released a record. But second of all, no one is stopping me.\u201d Part of it is actually inspirational. Instead of being \u2013 yeah, I should start. Some of it has to do with money. All those gadgets are money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB2\">Yeah, I can get them on eBay, but still, you\u2019re talking a few hundred dollars, easily, for the stuff I would need to do what I want to do.  So maybe if this thing goes through with the house, that might be part of it. That\u2019s the other thing with this house thing, I\u2019m hoping if it works out, I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB3\">to budget. I think I\u2019m going to hire a real . . . There was that woman in Detroit who wanted to be my PR. She\u2019s a big shot PR person, but I have to pay her. I might do that. Again, all these things are calculated risks because even music now is not just an acoustic guitar. I guess if you\u2019re a folk artist <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB4\">it is, but you need to invest a little bit in some gadgets and mikes and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So these are all things that would actually enhance your work right now, as opposed to the synthesizing, which you were saying that\u2019s just gadgety. [You want to get past that.] (ph?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">CLIENT: I think we sound awesome, but I hear things in my head that are little electronic texturing, not a full keyboard, but moments in songs where there are textures and weird things and weird little melodies that I hear in my head. Everyone is doing something. We can\u2019t do it. So those gadgets either <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF1\">allow us to program them and then I tap it with my foot and then they start happening. Or we have this guy, Isaac; he\u2019s there and he presses buttons. There are just little things like this, but you need a few hundred bucks to do all that, so in some ways it comes back to money. Mother fucker, I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF2\">just put that on a credit card. This is insane.  There is that, too. I end up feeling like I\u2019ve lost a lot of time because I just can\u2019t afford things; and that\u2019s got to change. This is ridiculous. It would be different if we really were impoverished, then it just is what it is; but if there are ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF3\">to take calculated risks and maximize what you have to make things happen now . . . enough is enough.

In other words, there is the band, but I\u2019m writing a shitload and it\u2019s hard for me to record that. I need the right gadgets and then I need a couple <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B71\">of hours with Philip or Stu or Grey. I have plenty of friends who could just come over; a six pack, pizza, and be like, \u201cAll right, dude. I want to record one song. I\u2019m going to tell you the things in my head. I have all this stuff here. Show me how to do this.\u201d And then I\u2019m off to the races. I will <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B72\">figure it out, but I just need from A to Z. So there\u2019s all this pent-up stuff. So when I say that\u2019s enough, I don\u2019t know what else to say. There\u2019s all this pent-up energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And I wonder what this means. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re pounding your fist. There\u2019s something . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">CLIENT: I really have stuff on my pants from Sophie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">THERAPIST: But you move into noticing that at that moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s because I just avert my eyes. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably that I just don\u2019t know what else . . . It\u2019s nervous energy, I guess. Frustration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Like it\u2019s something in your control maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: Maybe. (pause) What feels good is a lot of times, this feeling that I have now is anxiety, but I can tell it\u2019s a good anxiety. I\u2019m excited about things that I think are coming. I\u2019m excited that I\u2019m still writing songs that I really fucking like that, I think, they are getting better and better <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C31\">and more interesting. I feel like something is brewing and it just needs a little \u2013 it needs money.  Even booking shows, I can\u2019t. That\u2019s a part-time job, man. Follow up, sending things out, calling them and then sending posters. I just can\u2019t do all that. I\u2019ve tried my best and it\u2019s half-assed. You\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C32\">got to pay someone to do that. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s a lot when you don\u2019t have anything so you need to budget for these things because that\u2019s all it takes. I feel like all we need is a couple of more shows and we\u2019re going to start getting attention. I have no doubt about that. If I could do it with <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C33\">just me and a drummer, not writing songs that are as good as I\u2019m writing now, I\u2019m really not worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So you do feel like you\u2019re that close. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard you say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t mean like we\u2019re going to be like the Jackson Five. I mean like within a year, if we did have the resources that I want us to have, within a year we would be considered easily one of the best bands in town. Easily. Easily.  It\u2019s Darien. I was considered that before. In some ways, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C71\">not a big deal in Darien. At the same time, it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It is a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: It is a big deal. It is and it isn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">THERAPIST: (laughing) It\u2019s a huge deal, actually. I haven\u2019t heard you say that that bluntly and that matter-of-factly, not that I know of, at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">CLIENT: Deep down I know that I\u2019m easily one of the top five songwriters in this whole city. I have no doubt about that. I don\u2019t give a shit what anybody says. I hear what the bands are doing and it\u2019s nonsense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561570\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s a feeling that even taking sustained financial backing it\u2019s the only way it happens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D3\">CLIENT: Of course, because you need that mental space. You need to be able to say, \u201cOkay, Claire knows how to book shows. This is what she does. She loves our band. We need to pay her $100 a week;\u201d or $200 \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 or a percentage of whatever \u2013 so then she can get to work and she has connections. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D31\">She makes things happen. It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s really not difficult. Or a European tour \u2013 idiots go on European tours. I know this punk band that just went. They\u2019re nice guys, but it\u2019s just noise. I don\u2019t know what the music is in there. I know there\u2019s a crowd for that, but really, if they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D32\">going to travel all over Europe, I\u2019m not really worried about going. I just need help to do these things. That\u2019s all there is to it. (pause)  In that way, if I can separate with my mom, because I can\u2019t ask my mom to give me $5,000 to do some music things. She doesn\u2019t get that. There used to be a real <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D33\">separation so that I\u2019m just doing what I\u2019m doing and you have no financial worries anymore so we don\u2019t need to conflate anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t need her approval anymore for anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">CLIENT: No. (long pause)  The one thing I could be doing \u2013 but I\u2019m not and that\u2019s on me \u2013 is I\u2019m not playing solo shows. I\u2019ve said that before. That\u2019s on me. I could just send an e-mail to [plow] (ph?) and be like look \u2013 I could do that. I haven\u2019t been doing that. Part of it is that I still feel pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D71\">shy when I play by myself. Part of it is I almost don\u2019t see the point sometimes of that. It\u2019s a lot of effort to play for 25 people. I don\u2019t know. But it is something I think about. What is that?  Isn\u2019t that a different way to build a following. All this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You think you should?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB\">CLIENT: I think I should, but I\u2019m not a big fan of people that just play their acoustic guitars for an hour. I believe in my songs. I know my songs are good just as is on the acoustic guitar. I kind of bore myself a little bit. I maybe could. Again, the gadgets \u2013 if I taught myself to use things a certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB1\">way, play solo, tap my foot on a few pedals and suddenly there\u2019s some texture, now that\u2019s interesting to me. Just sitting in a bar playing for an hour \u2013 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s part of why you haven\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF\">CLIENT: Because I don\u2019t want to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Not just because you\u2019re afraid to, in other words, but you\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s what you want to present yourself as or what interests you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s even like our shows \u2013 a lot of shows I don\u2019t take because I just don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t know. Playing at a bar on a Wednesday night for 20 people? I don\u2019t know what purpose that serves anymore. Things have changed so much in music. It\u2019s more about just writing really good songs, recording <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E31\">them the way you want to record them, having some good videos \u2013 whatever. It\u2019s all Internet and non-geographic. Record labels don\u2019t come around anymore scouting. \u201cDo you have a following in Darien?\u201d They kind of don\u2019t give a shit much anymore. They care about what\u2019s your Internet \u2013 all that stuff.
