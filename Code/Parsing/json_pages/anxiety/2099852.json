I forgot how exhausting my Dad is. I always forget. He's a piece of work. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yes. (laughs) As I was leaving to come here James said, \"When you get out just give us a call because who knows where we'll be.\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: He's absolutely right. They could be anywhere. Oh. (laughs) I mean, you know, James probably is like, he's always ready but what he always wants to do is go to a coffee shop and have some coffee and get a little something, or go take a walk, or go to an art museum. And that's what I like to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">do, so that's good. It's always nice. But he's got this weird kind diffuseness or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">Like I sort of worry. He's talking about some neighbors, a neighbor of ours who's like my Dad's age who he said is in the early stages of dementia. And I worry about that with my Dad a lot. He's just so vague all the time. But at the same time he's like really sharp about some things. You just don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">know it until (laughs), you know, until he brings up something you said like two weeks ago in exactly the right moment. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So this morning he sends me a text while I'm still in bed and he's gotten up and gone out to go take a walk. And he says, you know, \"Come and have some coffee.\" I said, \"Okay, but it's going to take me a little bit because, you know, I have to take a shower. And James's in the shower now.\" And, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">know, I got up and it's just fret, fret, fret, fret, fret. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">This morning I was worrying about teaching and tutoring. You know, it's been a long time since I've taught. And what if I'm terrible at it? (laughs) So I texted him back and I said, you know, \"I really don't think I can come. Can you just come back here and we can have coffee here. I'm just not up for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">leaving the house right now.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And nothing. Like he didn't even write back. I didn't hear anything. So about fifteen minutes later it's, \"What's going on? Where is he?\" So I texted him again, you know, \"Hey, where are you? What's going on?\" Nothing. Nothing. So about half an hour after that, (laughs) you know, I had a crying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">fit between what I'm worrying about already and then worrying like, \"Is he upset with me? Has he had a stroke?\" Because he's had a stroke. Is he lost? What's going on? Like, where is he? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">So James called him and he doesn't answer his phone. (pause) (laughs) So, you know, maybe an hour and a half after I texted him the first time he called James back and he had just been reading. He just had forgotten to answer his phone and then apparently he was, \"Oh, James called me. I guess I'll call <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">him back.\" (pause) Uh. (pause) Uh. (pause) So between him being just so vague and me feeling like I have to keep really careful track of everything or I'll, you know, let him down in some major may and then he'll be upset with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I've been a little tense today. (laughs) (pause) He really doesn't want to hear about me being sad, it seems like. (pause) So. (long pause) So I just haven't been telling him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And I talked to him some about what's been going on with the ECT and being upset about that. You know, he just didn't really want to hear about it. Or he -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099852\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I think you may want me to help make sense of him for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Good luck. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: But yeah. Yeah. I don't know. (long pause) Sorry, I interrupted you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: No that's okay. Yeah. Or I think you want me to sort of at least try to make sense of your experience of him. (pause) Which I gather feels like it doesn't make sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Well, sometimes it's like he's so present and, you know, in those times, yeah, he's wise. You know, he just really knows. But most of the time, yeah, he's the opposite. (pause) You know, on the one hand I know he would do anything for me and I've seen him do anything for me. (pause) Um. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">And then on the other hand, um, (pause) I feel like he can't pay enough attention to me to care about me. (pause) Um. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">It's like he's just not, I mean he just doesn't see me. (pause) Yeah. He gets furious that one of his friends has taken to calling him a nickname. His name is David. Like, \"No, my name is not 'Dave.'\" Like, \"No.\" And he said actually this trip, you know, his football coaches used to call him \"Dave\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">and they were always really mean to him and he hated football. So he just doesn't like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">And I'm like, \"Okay. I understand that. I really sympathize with that.\" But he calls me his wife's name. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Sometimes. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Every time. (laughs) And like sometimes he corrects himself but a lot of the time he just doesn't. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: (pause) (sigh) You know, eventually you get used to it. Like he used to call me our dog's name. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:11:31)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: And, you know, you get used to it. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: But it's not my favorite thing. (laughs) (pause) It wouldn't do any good to say anything to him about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, because he's just not going to be able to remember. And then I'll just feel bad about the fact that he can't remember. (sigh) And it just doesn't seem worthwhile to me. (long pause) Yeah, I feel like I get upset with him over all of these little things that I don't think are worth talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">about. That I don't think they're worth getting upset about them. I don't think they're worth getting upset about, but I'm still upset. (laughs) So I don't know what to do.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well. (pause) These really aren't little things. I mean he texted you at the coffee shop, you texted him back. And not just anything, but something that conveyed that you're having a hard time and you weren't up to leaving the apartment. And he doesn't get back to you for an hour and a half. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">Like you're worried about his safety. Like you guys tried him three or four times. He doesn't pick up or respond. You have no idea afterwards, as far as I know, why he didn't respond. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like such a little thing. Like his treating you, you know, maybe if it were just the thing about names and that were isolated from everything else, that wouldn't be a huge deal. Although, like to have your father call you the dog's name. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: It's less weird than it seems. (laughs) Taken in context it seems pretty normal. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: That may be part of the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099852\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Because part of you is responding like it isn't normal and another part of you thinks it really ought to feel pretty normal, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess what I mean by, \"It's a little thing,\" is just that I don't feel like it would do any good to get upset about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Those are two entirely different things to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It probably wouldn't do a whole lot of good to get upset about the massacre in Cambodia in the seventies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: It doesn't mean it's a little thing. I don't mean to compare your childhood to the [massacre] (ph). I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I know. It's okay. (laughs) I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Okay. I was being a little dramatic, I guess. Partly because, well (pause) yeah, I think maybe that's part of how you had to think about it to kind of live with it without being really upset a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: It's that if you can't do anything about it, you shouldn't be upset about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: But if you are it means there's something wrong with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's about how I feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I can see how that like in a way has a sort of a practical value in that, you know, in theory you can control or do something about yourself being upset sort of. Or at least you could have the idea that you could, rather than, (pause) rather being confronted with something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">makes you upset that you can't control or in a way communicate with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I was really upset this morning. I was really, really upset. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I (pause), I felt like, you know, I think, you know, I was already on edge. I was already worrying a lot. And then just to have this thing with Poppa where I just had absolutely no control over the situation and I couldn't get any. And I felt like I should be doing something else, but I didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">know what I should be doing. But there was nothing else I could do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: And I didn't know whether he was angry with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: And I was, you know, I really worry about that. (pause) You know, I felt like I should be taking better care of him. But (pause) I just needed to take care of myself also. Yeah, because I really wasn't up to leaving the house. (laughs) You know, I was panicking. (pause) So I just cried a lot. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">James was very nice to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I think he did not have much idea of what was going on. But, you know, I didn't really understand what was going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: But, yeah, he was very nice to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: And the worry about tutoring and teaching was that wouldn't be good enough at it? That you'd be bad at it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I worry that, you know, I don't have much experience with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or that I just won't be able to do it right. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: I guess around a lot of this there's this sort of meta issue in a way that like you just can't be upset about stuff without framing it as you doing something wrong. Like with the teaching it occurs to me, you know, you may be worried because it could be hard. Or you could be worried that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">it will be overwhelming because you don't have a ton of experience at it. Or that you're rusty, or whatever. That's not exactly what you worry about, which is much more that you will screw it up. You will not do it right. Not that it will be difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099852\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not worried that it's going to be hard.

(laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Here again with your Dad like, oh my God, you're not hearing from him. He must be mad at you. Maybe you did something wrong. And clearly you shouldn't be upset about it. It seems that when you have a strong feeling about something, it has to come back to you feeling you're doing something wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yes. (pause) You know sometimes I have to twist things around pretty hard to frame it that I can be doing something wrong. (laughs) But I usually manage.

Well if I can't do anything about it, I shouldn't be upset about it is a pretty good [one.] (ph) And certainly also it occurs (inaudible at 00:23:36). Being upset about people who have died is entirely off the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well you can't do anything about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: (laughs) Fair enough.

I'm just kind of reiterating what you just said about like how sometimes you have to work pretty hard to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Oh, make it about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: [Make it my fault?] (ph) Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Well and I think a lot of it is because it doesn't feel like the other person can tolerate, take in, respond helpfully to what you feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I had a really good encounter with James last night, actually. I was very proud of myself. Where James was, we were going out to go get stuff for dinner and James said, \"I want to finish this first.\" And then just took way too long about it and, you know, because he 's working on this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">paper that's due tomorrow. And so eventually I said, \"We really should go.\" And, \"Well I guess we can go without you.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">And he was pretty rude and kind of snappish about being like, \"Yes, maybe you should do that.\" And I said, \"Well I thought you wanted to come with us.\" And he's like, \"You should've left fifteen minutes ago because the place closes in fifteen minutes.\" And so we ran out and got stuff and ran back. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">then I said, \"James, this really bothered me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: And he didn't apologize for it. And I didn't really expect him to apologize for it because, you know, it's like it really bothered me that you did it, but he's under a fuck ton of pressure. And it wasn't that big of a deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: And I just said, \"You know, I just really wanted to bring it up because I didn't want to let it fester.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: \"It irritated me, and I was irritated. But I feel like we're okay.\" So we just talked about it and then we got over it. It was great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, you know, I really trust James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: And from what you're describing with your Dad it seemed really clear, at least in part, with this came from. I mean (pause) In some sense you often have no idea where he's going to be in two minutes. Let alone sort of having any confidence or assurance that you can talk to him about something <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">at the time that it's bothering you between you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099852\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I'm sure there are times he can be right there for that, and you're saying that as one possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: But it's kind of luck. And, you know, the spaciness, a lot of it is very funny because like you just have to say, you just have to perceive it as funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Or it's going to drive you insane. I think it's the not knowing whether he's going to be able to listen to what I'm saying that really bothers me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: He sounds pretty impaired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: He's getting there. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Is this much different from how he's ever been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Not really. I feel like he's getting worse, but I don't think he's getting that much worse. He's kind of always been like this. But I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah at least your experience of him is like, you know, the experience of someone who is pretty impaired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Hm. Yeah. (pause) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm worried. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And like (pause) his daughter has been in a really bad way for a while. Just out of hospitalizations and ECT. He knows what that means. And you tell him you're upset and he didn't get back to you for an hour and a half. It's [distressing]. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I don't know how much of this is me making excuses for him, but I did work pretty hard yesterday to seem like I was good, like I was doing okay. Yeah, I had a pretty good day yesterday and I worked pretty hard to seem like I was just (inaudible at 00:30:52).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: So, I don't -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: If you can fool your own Dad who knows what's been going on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (whispers)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: I mean, I know you're good at coming across as doing well, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: This is why I tell him that I'm doing really well. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Well he knows about the ECT, he knows about the recent hospitalizations, he knows about the last years, he was married to somebody who was in and out of the hospital. Like, you know, you said he deals with people in the congregation who have [maybe similar] (ph) sorts of things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB1\">A day of seeming good, if that's convincing him you're fine <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Your father's, he's pretty far off there. I'm not saying that you might not be able to, I'm sure you could sort of make him think at any given moment that you're doing better, or [whatever better] (ph) I guess than you are. But there's a hell of a lot of context here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I feel like he doesn't, it feels like he's just not comfortable talking about this directly. Like he doesn't (pause) you know, he didn't really ask me how I was doing when he came up, you know, when he came in yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: And I think that was probably on purpose. You know, because he knows I'm going to tell him. But I also think he's trying to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: You know, I think he's here to try to help me. He just (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: I'm not doubting how much he loves you or that he's up here to help you because he knows, in part, because he just wants to see you and, in part, because he knows what's been going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2010A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099852\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's like, why won't he talk about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: (pause) Sorry, you were going to say something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: No, no. (long pause) I guess one of the main points I'm trying to make is, I imagine that a sort of big contribution to why you turn feelings into sort of your own fault in a way is because of not being able to count on him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: Hm. I guess I don't really see the connection. I mean I see that the one is true and I see the other is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">CLIENT: Um.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Well, with James you kind of do things in a different way than you might ordinarily, but you felt confident enough to come back and tell him like, \"Hey, that kind of pissed me off. And I know you're under a lot of pressure.\" But you broached it with him because you had some confidence he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">would hear you, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like it would even cross your mind to tell your Dad how much it affected you for the hour and a half that you didn't hear from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Well, I think about talking to him about it but I decide this isn't going to get me anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: And I believe you about that. I'm not, [in terms of true or not ] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: It's probably not a hundred percent true. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like it is. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: My point is not to doubt that talking to him wouldn't be productive. It's to point out that I think you're pretty convinced it wouldn't productive and that sort of leaves the whole thing in your lap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: But it seems to me that's kind of, that's just how he's often been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: Like that idea that he couldn't hear you, he didn't respond when you texted him five times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well on the part of it that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, is that making the connection clearer? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah. It makes it a lot clearer. Yeah. The part that isn't really, isn't as much less of an issue now, but was a huge issue when I was younger was that, I mean, it used to be that I could never tell what was going to piss him off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: And what he was going to blow up about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">CLIENT: And he doesn't blow up as much anymore. He doesn't blow up much at all. But that's still who he is in my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: Right. And in a way still who you probably most unconsciously feel like you're dealing with. In other words, even you know consciously that he's not going to blow up, the habits that you have are still formed by dealing with somebody who might at any time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I'm still in the habit of treating him like glass in that way. It's like this might explode at any moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: And I think actually probably of treating everyone somewhat like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Even people who in your head you know different about. And you're starting to change that. I mean that's a good example with James, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: And I think somewhat with me as well. But I guess it seems (inaudible 00:39:43) it gets in there too in a big way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) See now in some ways I feel like, well of course I say I think everything is my fault. I grew up with somebody who used to tell me that everything was my fault. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20150-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20150-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099852\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: Like, (inaudible at 00:40:15)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: Wait a minute, I think see where you going with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: (laughs) So I don't know if I have told you about this, but I've been sailing with my Dad once. Did I tell you about the sailing trip?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Uh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: It was horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you did. But I'm not sure -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: We were in the Florida Keys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: Oh no. I don't know that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: Because his ex-girlfriend, this woman he dated for like ten years, her Dad has a house in the Florida Keys and lives there much of the year. So we were in the Florida Keys and he had this Sunfish, this little teeny sailboat that he had fixed up. And he doesn't really know how to sail. But he <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201651\">is really good on boats and so he knows enough of his way around pretty much any boat. And he's like, \"Yeah, it'll be fun.\" So he was kind of playing around with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">And so he took me out in it and we went out to go out for picnic or whatever. We went exploring. We didn't bring enough water and he got cranky and I had no idea what I was doing, and I was like eight or nine. I was older than eight, I was maybe ten or eleven at the time. And at one point I think he <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201671\">told me to watch something or do something and I wasn't doing it right. And the boom swung around and hit him and he fell out of the boat and he lost his glasses. They dropped into the water and he couldn't find them again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">And he got just like furious with me. He said, \"Now it's your damn felt my glasses are lost.\" This was my fault. Of course it wasn't my fault. He was the one sailing the boat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: But of course I believed him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">CLIENT: And I think at some later point and time after he had cooled down, he, \"That was really uncalled for. I was out of line.\" He apologized to me. And now he makes jokes about it. He tells that story to people. It's like, \"No! What is wrong with you?\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: I don't even know what to do with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: (laughs) It's just ridiculous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Well one thing that strikes me about it is that I suspect his making a joke out of it means he sees it as a quite isolated incident. That he doesn't make the connection between exploding and blaming you when he was responsible that time, and the all the other times. Which was a big part of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B1\">your childhood, it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I mean I tend to see his making jokes about it as him just being deeply, deeply ashamed of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Oh. Are they more self-deprecating jokes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean he's like, \"Ha ha.
