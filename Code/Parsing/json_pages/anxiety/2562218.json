(pause)  She\u2019s very nice, but she has a strong personality in terms of like we did a microwave analysis on her samples that she did. It\u2019s very baseline learning and the inferences. Also, just from a statistical standpoint, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">usually need three replicates of each sample so you can average across three samples and it kind of gets rid of sample-to-sample variation.  She doesn\u2019t have that for every single sample. She has it for some of them, but not all \u2013 and that\u2019s fine. This is for her to learn the tools. But she kept pushing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">and making a lot of inferences about the data that we were looking at. It\u2019s nice and exciting and thought that I would like to see her data and look at genes and look at papers that have looked at this gene in a different context. It just felt like very dangerous. I had a feeling like Bryan \u2013 he wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">really around; he was busy \u2013 but when he did pop in and say hi or ask her how it was going or what she was working on, she would kind of say things about everything that we were looking at and be jumping to conclusions, like \u201cI\u2019m ready for this paper and we\u2019re going to do this and this.\u201d  This stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">was all first look, preliminary. It was a lot. I want her to be excited about data. I told her that you need replicates and we have to do statistical testing. Bryan was going to say something, but she was still kind of like \u201cWell . . .\u201d  I just don\u2019t know if it was her, if I was teaching it wrong, how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D5\">to look at things, how to find things that are interesting and how to use the tools. We\u2019ll see. After she left yesterday, I felt a little like I was going to be in so much trouble because I haven\u2019t been doing my normal stuff for the past Monday and Tuesday.  She seemed happy and had tons of information <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D6\">to go off of and things that she could take back and learn, so that was okay; but I just felt like I didn\u2019t caution her enough or maybe that was just kind of the way I was taught, so everything was kind of like \u201cdon\u2019t do that;\u201d \u201cbe cautious;\u201d \u201cit\u2019s dangerous to do this comparison to this.\u201d (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: [So the end of it was that it was kind of] (ph?) stressful that she seemed so cavalier, in this potentially responsible way, leaving it open as to whether you hadn\u2019t explained it well enough to her or because it\u2019s how she is or her not understanding. And also because you were feeling kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">of vulnerable for not having gotten done the stuff done that you usually do on Monday and Tuesday? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. Also I wanted to give her more exciting things to see or make sure that she got everything; and I felt like I didn\u2019t know how to do that. (pause) I guess either way I felt like I either wasn\u2019t prepared enough for her or I was in trouble with Bryan because I was kind of letting her dictate <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">what she wanted to look at and how she wanted to look at things.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I see. The way you describe her seems to capture her pretty well, how you\u2019re worried about being blamed for being. In other words, she\u2019s cavalier, she\u2019s doing things kind of off the cuff, and too quickly she\u2019s not being careful. She\u2019s not being plan-ful enough, in a way, and that seems like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">it\u2019s kind of the view you\u2019re worried that Bryan could take of you, in the sense that you haven\u2019t been careful enough in how you taught her; because you couldn\u2019t get to your other stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20012-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562218\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)  I don\u2019t know. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess it just didn\u2019t seem like everything was kind of (inaudible at 00:10:50) and then in the background, again, Bryan had a meeting today with his company.  Someone else had actually done the samples and I process them for microwave, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200151\">in the background I was hearing them and worrying about those samples to make sure he was okay. It was like everything was harder and I was oversaturated. I was worrying about them. I couldn\u2019t critically think about things. I was just worrying all the time how to be helpful or to keep myself calm.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200152\">(pause) I guess it\u2019s hard for me to step back or [let her] (ph?) handle everything.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s also kind of hard to step back in the way that you are now and look at how things were the last couple of days.  Again, I have the sense that even if you knew at the time that you were stressed and worried about all of these things, it\u2019s a little different to be reflecting on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">it here and feeling bad about it; feeling that it\u2019s not how you want it to be. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s because I want to clean up the mess that\u2019s happened the last two days. (pause) During those two days, on Monday it was a lot and I was just (inaudible at 00:15:55) through the whole time.  Since then I was worried that I wasn\u2019t going to teach her enough or I\u2019m a fraud, that I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">know anything, or is this is going to be okay. It\u2019s just hard to go back to normal after she went to her hotel. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Like it\u2019s hard to settle down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. Like to step back from feeling overwhelmed and feeling like not wanting to do this, to step back and see what needs to be done or that it will be okay \u2013 stuff like that. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard when somebody is in your space like that, especially all day. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I guess I\u2019m just left with the feeling of ugh, that sucked, and feeling like I need to fix it. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m trying to think of what it\u2019s like and the things that are coming to mind are like if you get cut open or like some boundary of yours gets breached and worries start to flood out.  In a way, then the other person\u2019s problems become your problems. It does, like with this (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">at 00:24:29).  I think as soon as it seemed to you like she was having a problem, that became a problem \u2013 like is it her problem? Is it your problem? Is it your problem because it\u2019s your fault? Is it your problem because it\u2019s just going to reflect badly on you even if it\u2019s not your fault? Something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">like that. (pause)  It\u2019s like something that you feel responsible for but have very little control over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I just feel like I\u2019ve given her this task and I feel like I\u2019m supposed to teach it in a way that\u2019s most useful and they get it.  What I feel like I did is kind of more dangerous or sloppier. I feel like everything that happens while she\u2019s here is my responsibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562218\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: It reminds me a little bit of how somebody might feel about their newborn, like that sense of worry and (inaudible at 00:28:04) can have and they are particularly responsible for this other person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: You want to do it perfectly, but you\u2019re not sure; and then you\u2019re too overwhelmed or kind of tired to even analyze what\u2019s going on.  (pause) I guess I just don\u2019t want to deal with it because I feel like there are so many other things going on in my world that I need to fix or I need to clean <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">up or I need to be thinking about; and I\u2019m just kind of bombarded and it\u2019s hard. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t quite know what to make of this association I\u2019m having, but it does sound, the way you talk about it, not unlike an overwhelmed parent \u2013 like an infant or a little kid where it\u2019s so important to do it right, but you\u2019re tired and overwhelmed and it\u2019s hard to think and do it right. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">When you focus on one thing, there are three other things bombarding you and you\u2019re very responsible.  I say I don\u2019t know what to make of it because that\u2019s not literally the situation that you\u2019re in; (chuckles) but there are some things about it that seem a lot like that. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: I feel, especially at work, that it\u2019s just like cleaning up or fixing all of these messes that I\u2019m half or fully responsible for them and it (inaudible at 00:34:24) and I can\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t allow for me to feel comfortable or even want to interact with people or even try to help them; or like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">they want to be responsible for work . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Like you overcome another (inaudible at 00:35:13), something you don\u2019t really have control over; something that you feel really responsible about and it can get very stressful. It sort of compounds that anxiety that you\u2019re already feeling. (long pause) It seems like you\u2019re in danger on two <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">fronts, really, with all of this stuff. One front is maybe it\u2019s your conscience or maybe it\u2019s Bryan or whomever; but the danger there is of feeling or being made to feel like you\u2019ve done a terrible job in one way or another. That\u2019s one danger I think that you\u2019re up against.  The other one is more like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">from the projects themselves, where here comes another one that you may have to take on and that may make you more stressed out; or may just give you a lot of trouble in some way or another. That seems to be the other danger \u2013 that you\u2019re just going to keep getting overloaded as new problems or new <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">job responsibilities come along.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: These things are [wrapped] (ph?) in concert, but it seems like those are the chief threats, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I guess it\u2019s just hard for me to have confidence or feel like the key thing, like \u201cwell, I did the best I can\u201d and forget about it; but it\u2019s just hard for me to be okay with it or feel good about it or confident or whatever that is.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah \u2013 it must feel like the projects you\u2019re involved in, in a way, almost feel too dangerous to just put away and feel good about. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I guess I don\u2019t know how to put a stop to it because I just want more structure.
