(pause) I\u2019m stressed about the flowers. I\u2019ve been stressed about them all week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. [3:13] I\u2019m sad that I told you what to do with them. I\u2019m sad they\u2019re gone because I have those tulips at home and they\u2019re still there, and they\u2019re dying but they\u2019re quite charming. (pause) I really like\u2026 it\u2019s like the\u2026 my most favorite thing in the world, select and arrange and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">sort of fantasize about getting you flowers and then give you flowers. That makes me very happy. But I guess I must\u2019ve been anxious on Monday about them. So I just said something. The pigeon started to squawk and I said something pigeon-y, and it was throw these out and they die. [4:42] I didn\u2019t mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">it. So the pigeon won\u2019t shut up and the pigeon says well, if you want your flowers to last longer you have to cut them every day, you have to change the water, you have to make sure that the jar is clean because the bacteria stays in the jar. But I just want to give you flowers and have them be yours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Well first, I mean thank you. That\u2019s lovely. I know there are also issues. I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: It was supposed to be a non-analytic gift and then it turned a little bit into an analytic gift. (laughter) And it\u2019s fine. Something\u2026 there\u2019s something there and it\u2019s been bothering me all week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s because I have the tulips in my house. And I think they\u2019re the first flowers I\u2019ve purchased for you. [6:11] Maybe that (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Maybe you were talking about your heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Like this is how to care for it? Plus, I don\u2019t actually want to tell you anything about how to care for it. I want to be in your hands. What did you mean? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Maybe you wanted to give me something and put it in my hands and you\u2026 your anxiety is worried about doing that because you feel like it wasn\u2019t in a way that I guess you wanted to be. [8:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: My anxiety about putting myself, or the flowers, in your hands? But they are the gift I want them to be. I want to get out of the way of them. The\u2026 at least whatever day it was, Thursday, there was something that was too anxious about just being out of the way, so it felt better to say something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">to try to take control or something. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted. [9:57] (pause) I feel like I messed up or something. (pause) I\u2019m thinking about all these flower associations [inaudible] you go to the temple as a family or my mom goes once or twice a week now if I don\u2019t really anymore. [12:54] Often she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">will bring a bouquet of flowers and fruits, depending on what\u2019s happening and when\u2026 what it is exactly. She\u2019ll cook something. And you sort of just put them there and you don\u2019t try to control what happens to them. But it\u2019s because there\u2019s a priest who does the flower management. There\u2019s hundreds of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D3\">bouquets of flowers. It\u2019s a thing. People bring flowers. And at the Waltham Center there\u2019s fresh flowers everywhere, and if somebody\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s like the people who go offer flowers. And I think there\u2019s somebody who sort of\u2026 there\u2019s somebody in charge every week, of them. And it switches off. But there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D4\">are always fresh flowers there. [14:30] And then the third association I had with this, boy in 7th grade. (laughs) His\u2026 he was among several suitors at that time. I played tennis with him and he\u2026 he\u2019s from Puerto Rico or something but he was adopted by these white republican Christian people in Arlington, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D5\">Virginia, this white republican Christian town until just about ten years ago it started changing. That\u2019s where my parents live. So anyways it\u2019s this dark brown kid. He shows up unexpected at my house. He would come to my house often to pick me up to play tennis. He shows up with this bouquet of dandelions <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D6\">in a vase. (laughs) And my dad opened the door and I was like bye Dad. I went outside with him and just started to receive them and do whatever I could to make it clear that I really appreciated it. And then I come inside, my dad was hysterically laughing. And he said that was the funniest thing ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D7\">and proceeded\u2026 has made fun of this boy since then. But it\u2019s like if you want to bring flowers to a girl and you\u2019re young, you\u2019re not going to\u2026 under pleasant [ph?] circumstances you might ask your parents to help you but you\u2019re not going to ask for your parents to help you. So what\u2019s at your disposal <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D8\">in the summer? Dandelions. They\u2019re perfectly good flowers. And it was so sweet. And he didn\u2019t know anything about the stupid conventions about flowers, like dandelions and carnations and whatever else. [17:07] He just, yeah, he was a blank slate or something. He hadn\u2019t been written on by women. [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D9\">So I see myself in all three of those stories. (pause) Sometimes I think of myself as a blank slate for you. And I\u2019ve been written on by [inaudible] therapist [inaudible] counselor [inaudible]. So I\u2019m not jaded the way that I hear\u2026 I don\u2019t have that in my [inaudible] (pause) Next you\u2019ll [ph?] write <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D10\">about the flowers\u2019 heart. [21:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562122\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I have another thought, too. (pause) There\u2019s something, one aspect, I think, with these flowers, I\u2019d say, was something I think I, too, felt pretty young about it. And not like [inaudible] give flowers as a kind of gesture or part of a communication where it\u2019s more like how a little kid gives <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">her dad a picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Like draws her dad a picture? [23:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And it\u2019s not sort of like you know what this is and what it means and I do and here\u2019s sort of this thing we have that\u2019s kind of [inaudible] understanding. I was like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Look what I did!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: And I think it\u2019s something about that quality of it relates to the intensity of the shame that you feel, I think, too. Maybe some of the stuff about the pigeon felt a little bit about how your dad was about the flowers. I guess the similarity I have in mind is from this vantage point we understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">for him what was funny. He wasn\u2019t laughing in a critical way but if the boy had seen it he would have probably died on the spot. [25:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562122\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: He would\u2019ve just died, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And similarly I don\u2019t think you felt like I was being sort of mean or critical with the pigeon stuff, and you told me as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: But still I wonder if there\u2019s that sense of shame about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Well immediately it seems like there was a difference between me and the [inaudible] pigeon. Maybe it started off without too much shame about wanting to be the one to decide where we go and when and how fast and steer, drive. But I don\u2019t think that lasted for very long so there\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s more <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">comfortable for me to decide on some path because it\u2019s better than dealing with the anxiety of\u2026 for the flowers, okay, you\u2019re right. I feel pretty differently about looking back on it in light of the pigeon than I would have if you had never mentioned the pigeon. [27:16] But the shame, I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">what the shame is. It\u2019s\u2026 maybe it\u2019s confusing why there\u2019s anxiety there in the first place. And it\u2019s even\u2026 and it feels shameful the way that I chose to react to it. And already today I\u2019m choosing a very, very\u2026 it feels like I\u2019m choosing a very, very different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well it seems like some of the rawness is still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Right. I think I haven\u2019t chosen is part of it. It\u2019s like I\u2019m bringing it to you and it\u2019s raw and I don\u2019t\u2026 some part of me feels like I need to cook it and then bring it to you. And that\u2019s the pigeon part and that\u2019s the throw out the flowers before they die part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: And then I think a growing part of me is like\u2026 and I just want to bring it to you or sort of talk to you about it, the way it is. [29:15] (pause) I think that\u2019s a struggle that shows up a lot here. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m aware of this. I think I just rush really fast to cook things. And the flowers <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">and the pigeon and the timing is making me realize how much I struggle with it, yeah, with that, how strong those two forces are, always, when I\u2019m here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I guess this is getting a little theoretical, but have you read about or heard about the Oedipus complex? [30:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: This is probably it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: [inaudible] say more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Sure, that theory, sort of pure and vulnerable sense of desire and openness, the possibility for shame, for getting a shaming response to that, and the sort of automatic and pervasive protecting and also concealing response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: That\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: That sort of collection of elements. [32:08] I guess part of\u2026 I have in mind a few things. I don\u2019t tend to focus much on the historical aspects of things, but I think it\u2019s probably all there, the story about your dad. And it wasn\u2019t you giving him the flowers, it was the boy giving you the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">flowers, but he was involved and he had the response that you were afraid he would have. And I would guess that the pigeon-y stuff is\u2026 my hunch is that\u2019s an idiom that is from your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: What about the Oedipus complex [inaudible] talk about with respect to gender? And what do you have to say about that in light of this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: These days most people\u2026 okay. I believe Freud imagined it was different for boys and girls. These days people don\u2019t really think that way about it so much. Nor do they think about it as sort of as Unitarian things. In other words, there\u2019s all possible\u2026 all sorts of possible triangles between <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">the kid and the parents. And they\u2019re not necessarily correlated with someone\u2019s adult sexuality. [33:54] But these kind of triangles often emerge and play an important part in how people find themselves handling lots of situations, which seem to be what you were saying about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562122\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: A really strong\u2026 when you talked about the kid giving her dad a picture that she drew, a really strong image came up for me of my dad giving me a Valentine one year. I think my dad gives me a Valentine every year. [35:05] I\u2019m trying to think if he did last year or the year before, but certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">until then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s something else I want to add to it. I can wait, to hear this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Did I just make you think of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I thought of it a minute ago as I was talking and forgot about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Well one year he gave me a green Valentine. It was a green heart card. And it said remember, you\u2019re always my favorite Valentine inside. And I read it and I was like (sound effect) I think I was 17 or something. And I\u2019ve asked for pretty green Valentines since then. He usually remembers to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">it green. But it never says that in it again. So I was thinking, when you talked about the kid giving the dad the drawing, I was thinking about my dad giving me a green Valentine. [36:24] Because somehow it works the other way for me, for that Valentine and some other stuff. You can be very, very, very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">good embodying (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: The other thing I was about to say is trying to be clear that I\u2019m not trying to reduce what happened with the flowers or what you felt with them to early stuff. I\u2019m just saying I think there are echoes of that early stuff in what happened, which I think is sort of expectable, generally, in relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m clear about it but I don\u2019t need to be right now. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m clear about the scope of the early stuff that you were talking about, beyond this one dandelion thing that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I think the Valentine seems to be [inaudible] pretty clearly.

How does that get at the flowers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Because there\u2019s this\u2026 part of the whole thing is the little kid wants that parent exclusively for themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, I definitely wanted [overlapping talk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: \u2026to be the favorite, and probably we should really either run away or get rid of these remedies [ph?]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. So do you think that people develop concealing habits, your protective habits, because it\u2019s so painful, and maybe not even possible, to be so\u2026 stay so vulnerable with your parents or parent or parent figure forever? [40:26] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well that makes me wonder what made it typical for you, or what makes it typical for you, to feel vulnerable in that way with me. Maybe anxious is a better word than difficult [ph?] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: [inaudible] That can make me anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: It can. And I think it also relates to the shame. [42:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Of really liking you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: No, no, sorry, the shame that you felt about being [inaudible] or the shame that\u2019s sort of out there in the ether that could\u2019ve been part of my reaction, or that could\u2019ve come from my reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562122\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: But I totally am the pigeon. I think I\u2019m ashamed of it here and not\u2026 and\u2026 or I\u2019m starting\u2026 I don\u2019t think shame is strong. I think I\u2019m starting to see that part of me as being somewhat restricted\u2026 restrictive to me. And it\u2019s embarrassing here, I think, because of the nature of our relationship. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">[43:54] Whereas I think I\u2019m still quite empowering in most other times. Being the pigeon has felt empowering to me because it usually works, and that\u2019s somehow the only part I\u2019ve paid attention to. But it also does a lot of other things, like you don\u2019t really get to see what the other people want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">do or want. You also\u2026 there\u2019s also a lot less serendipity that comes in life, and that, I think, comes directly from my mom the way that she is in her life. She\u2019s a pigeon too. And [inaudible] not getting what you want, it\u2019s not totally useless. [45:19] (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Okay, I never heard you say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: So those are things that I have in mind. Or maybe there are lots of things that I am not thinking of now [inaudible] about why I haven\u2019t really thought about or I haven\u2019t been made to think about what aspects of my behavior\u2026 how that aspect of my behavior could be making things harder for me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">until the pigeon. There have been lots of [inaudible] pigeons here too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Do you mean that\u2019s something we talked about [inaudible]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: I keep thinking of this tug, this raw versus cooked tug, and there\u2026 and maybe it\u2019s the same tug but there\u2019s this other pair of opposing forces that has been coming up for me and Jeremy. [47:14] I wonder if it\u2019s the same thing. So I didn\u2019t treat him\u2026 I didn\u2019t behave that well towards him over <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">our Christmas travels. And I knew it and he knew it and he brought it up to me and I\u2026 and we sort of watched it through the week. And it\u2026 I\u2019m very grateful that we could look at it in that way and not have it become a big thing. But it was\u2026 the [inaudible] was very bad. I sort of ignore him when I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200992\">with my family. In Kentucky it was different because there were 24 people, and it was two and a half days of very, very condensed and very concentrated for me. [48:33] So I was really navigating all the people and what has become a household term for us, harvesting, everyone, working my way through. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200993\">But then I was a little sensitive to the fact that it was sort of downright unpleasant for Jeremy to be there so I thought that I kept it in mind. Then when we got to Virginia I\u2026 he\u2019s very happy there, at my parents\u2019 house, and enjoys being there, so I think that part went away. And then I just really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200994\">didn\u2019t pay much attention to him at all, to the point where he would walk into a room and I would continue my conversation with the person and leave to go do something else and never acknowledge him and never make eye contact with him. [49:39] Again and again and again. And I think that\u2019s been true <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200995\">always in my parents\u2019 house, but I think I was particularly bad this time. And it\u2019s in such contrast to how we are at home where I\u2019m please talk to me, please do something with me, please help me with this. Can we please do something together now? Jeremy! You\u2019ve been doing that for so long; what are <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200996\">you going to do next. I\u2019m so, I hate the word but, dependent. And it\u2019s obviously changed a lot in the last year. And while that is a pretty accurate caricature, it\u2019s still a caricature. Maybe it was more, a lot more, accurate maybe a year ago and now it\u2019s okay; I have a great time by myself. [50:58] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200997\">I just need to remember that. And I can tap into that space and I can approach Jeremy in a much less pigeon-y way. Sorry. Pigeon is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562122\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Did you like the book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t read the book but I remembered that Michael loves Knufflebunny. And I talked to Tammy about Don\u2019t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus. I asked if she had it. And she said no, but anyways, so I have it. I haven\u2019t thought about getting [inaudible] but I have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Sorry, go ahead. I [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: I think I will read\u2026 I\u2019d like to read the book sometime. So while that is the way that I am, with Jeremy at home, it\u2019s changing. It\u2019s still much more skewed to the\u2026 Jeremy\u2019s really comfortable with a ton of space and gives me a ton of space, and we\u2019re talking more about how my growing into the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">space can be easier, can be made easier by his being a little more sensitive to the fact that it\u2019s kind of a slow process for me. [52:31] So I think I\u2019m very ashamed of\u2026 that I feel like I need Jeremy so much when we\u2019re at home. And I think when Jeremy is around a lot of people, especially\u2026 actually, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A12\">it\u2019s really anyone, even my nights with his family he\u2019s always looking to check in with me. When we\u2019re around a lot of people he sort of becomes the dependent one. And it\u2019s slightly not\u2026 less comfortable. And it feels really good to him to be\u2026 feel like I\u2019m on his team, which it should be. It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A13\">like soon someday Jeremy will\u2026 when will I not have to be on Jeremy\u2019s team when we\u2019re at home. [53:43] Jeremy\u2019s my family. So anyway, so I think I notice that he\u2019s not shining. It\u2019s not an environment that makes him shine. And I don\u2019t like it and want him to be more independent at\u2026 when we\u2019re with my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A14\">family. I want him to find his own things to do and talk to people and not need me, not need to make eye contact with me or check in with me, so I just enforce it. And of course it has the opposite effect. It feels terrible to be ignored that way. And I\u2019m so comfortable and I just have no\u2026 the anxiety <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A15\">really melts away. The anxiety that I feel in my home with Jeremy melts away when I\u2019m with people that I love turn out to be my family. And so my\u2026 and then\u2026 but then there\u2019s the anxiety of seeing him dependent, and somehow that brings out cold [inaudible] (pause) I feel that [inaudible] here too. [55:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: What do you mean? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: I either\u2026 or I want to feel\u2026 either feel really dependent on you or really independent. And I\u2019m sort of ignoring you at one level. I\u2019m cooking [inaudible] things left and right myself and I\u2019m not really letting you be a part of the scene, even though it\u2019s\u2026 I always really want you to be part <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">of the scene. But somehow I access it from two really different places. [57:05] (pause) There\u2019s other stuff going on with my family, too. I don\u2019t go to Virginia to talk to Jeremy. I feel like I\u2019m making up a lot of missed time with other people there. So some of those outright responding to what I perceive <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A52\">as being somewhat\u2026 Jeremy being somewhat too dependent, and then some of it is outright responding to what I perceive to be, I don\u2019t know, I need to get all of my mom as I can, all of my grandfather as I can, or the other people. And then there\u2019s this really tense history of Jeremy coming to my parents\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A53\">house as a young college boy. And he\u2019s still the worst conversationalist ever. But back then I had not accepted that and felt like my love should be contingent on him\u2026 his becoming a better conversationalist. So there\u2019s a lot of\u2026 I get stirred up sometimes when he\u2019s in my house and he\u2019s not making conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A54\">with other people. No, go talk to somebody else before I talk to you. It\u2019s very hurtful.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I respond to Jeremy that way because\u2026 where it\u2019s very similar to how I respond to myself when I\u2019m feeling that way [inaudible] it comes up the most [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it\u2019s\u2026 I think it\u2019s sort of related to pigeoning, I think, when you\u2019re that way. You don\u2019t want to be reminded. [60:50] We\u2019ve talked about two, I think, of being passive, being unable to kind of maneuver with people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I can round up the troops really well when I\u2019m feeling comfortable and in charge and happy in the momentum of things, and when I\u2019m feeling despondent or desperate or even frustration can sometimes bring this up, deeply, deeply frustrated or lonely or sad or upset I have trouble remembering <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">that there are any troops or knowing what to say to them or being really worried about how I\u2019m going to seem. [62:07] And most of all asking for them, asking for help, asking\u2026 saying that I need them. (pause) Sometimes I don\u2019t know if you think that sometimes I think I\u2019m under the impression that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD2\">am driving the bus here. The pigeon is [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] the pigeon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s making you think that I feel really ashamed about it the more I bring it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Oh, the pigeon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like I feel some shame about it but I\u2019m bringing it up because it\u2019s\u2026 the timing and the visual and the way that you told the story fit well, so I\u2019m going to use it. Okay? So I don\u2019t know if you have the impression\u2026 if you think that I have the impression that sometimes I totally drive <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B51\">the bus here. Or maybe not now or recently but that I have had the impression that I\u2019m in charge or that I am (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think you mostly feel that way.

And it seemed like you were both letting me know how it was and anxious about that, but it was more in the future. You didn\u2019t\u2026 but no, I don\u2019t have that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">impression that you feel like you\u2019re\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Because when I talk about you, which I don\u2019t get to do often, which makes me sad, but when I do I told Jeremy all about the pigeon book. There\u2019s a godlike reverence in my voice that doesn\u2019t really match, sometimes, how I want to feel here or how I try to feel or how the pigeon makes me seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD1\">or something [inaudible] But it\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s been there since I met you, where the other person hearing the story would think, man, this Josh guy is good or man she\u2026 he\u2019s really got her wrapped around his finger or man they\u2019ve really got something going. [67:07] All three. So it\u2019s confusing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD2\">to me why my driving the bus comes up because there\u2019s this other\u2026 there\u2019s this reverence part that\u2019s always been there.

[70:04] How they couldn\u2019t hear the end of how incredible he is even though many times it felt like I was trying to change him or make\u2026 control him or make him <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C51\">better when it was just the two of us. And that\u2019s a dynamic that I feel here. And it\u2019s confusing why they seem at\u2026 they don\u2019t seem to gel. In both cases it was very important to me that the person I was telling got how good he is. It was like I needed their approval, or it was very, very, scary to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C52\">that they might not agree. [71:22] So there was some sense of that, of worry or desperation. It doesn\u2019t really happen now much with Jeremy. I don\u2019t feel like I have to compensate or convince anybody. And it happens a lot less with you, but I heard it in my voice in the pigeon story. (pause) Do you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C53\">it\u2019s possible that children bear their parents\u2019 grief? [75:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Do mean in terms of carrying it for them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t mean are shaped by or get messed up by, actually hold it.

(pause) He has so much grief and it\u2019s just there and it\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s sort of sealed up except <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C91\">to me. [76:50] And there are different times in my life where I\u2026 I see this in others, too, different times where the different children are like one of the two parents. And I think that\u2019s fascinating, how this\u2026 what their switches [ph?] are and why they happen and what are times for other [ph?] person <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C92\">but [inaudible] But this feels exclusively like a father [ph?] lifetime for me. And I feel like I\u2019ve taken up many\u2026 very uncanny parts of him, or I was given them. [78:15] Or I inherited them and they\u2019re all coming out now. Or they\u2019ve always been there and I\u2019m noticing them now. Both. I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C93\">so many things. Like his muscle build. My brother, the way that he puts on muscle is so much like my mom. No matter how strong he is he doesn\u2019t look strong. And I put on so much muscle, or my muscle definition is\u2026 looks so strong even when I\u2019m not fit or strong at all. And perspiration. My brother sweats <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C94\">like my mom, which is not at all. And my dad and I are just like constantly dripping from so many different things. And it\u2019s really weird. That\u2026 was there were lots of examples like that but just now I was thinking of the sort of childlike excitement and the sort of very, very, very intense pain. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C95\">he has whatever pain he has and I\u2019m whatever pain I have but they seem to\u2026 the intensity seems to be much more similar between the two of us than with my mom or my brother, the way that his pain works and the anxiety and the dreaming and the sort of attachment to or reverence of people and the philosophical <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C96\">approach to things and sort of, I don\u2019t know, constantly being challenged by existential questions. [81:04] There\u2019s a lot to say but it came up that maybe I\u2019m\u2026 he didn\u2019t have the space to hold his grief until, really, I was born because I\u2019m told then people were dying and people were getting moved around <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C97\">the world. And then I was born, the PhD ended, the job started, the\u2026 his dad got to live with my parents forever, and things sort of seemed to quiet down a lot. But it feels like I have the space that he didn\u2019t. (pause) Yeah, there\u2019s the whole reincarnation [ph?] of his mother thing. And the fainting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C98\">Did you know that he has the same fainting thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562122\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">THERAPIST: I remember that he collapsed on your birthday before your wedding but that was different, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, he had lost a third of his blood that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Oh my God, I don\u2019t remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">CLIENT: Through rectal bleeding. Yeah, I have many flashbacks from that day. No, he has the same, whatever it is, combination of anxiety and a sort of hyper sensitive vasovagal response. So he faints when he\u2019s very sick or when he\u2019s in a lot of pain. [83:45] (pause) Hi. (pause) Right before you said <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D11\">that Oedipus thing, you had a pose that was the pose that I would want to draw you in, which is a somewhat common pose for you where you\u2019re sort of searching for the words. [85:39] And you were looking that way. You were like this. There was sort of a crinkle in your eyebrow and you were about to speak, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D12\">and it seemed like you were about to speak for a while before you actually did. And I wanted to interrupt you and say that\u2019s the pose but you were about to speak. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] minutes. [87:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: I think the elements in the Oedipal complex come up real fast when you say we\u2019ve just got a few minutes because the same combination of no and how can you say that. You were so mean, you\u2019re so cruel, and how could I change this so it would be less painful. Maybe I should suggest that I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D51\">say when we have a few minutes. Not like whenever I want; when we actually have a few minutes. All of that just came up really fast and it feels really similar to the flowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I was wondering, also, if in the pose that you wanted to draw me, I seemed sort of open and unselfconscious in a way that [inaudible] related to what you\u2019re just mentioning. [89:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">CLIENT: There\u2019s a lot of potential in the pose that says to me there\u2019s a lot of potential here in this moment and about to reveal something, or something\u2019s forming but it hasn\u2019t quite formed. It\u2019s got the anticipation and sweetness of something actually being formed and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re\u2026 that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D91\">I will\u2026 that you will share it with me but you haven\u2019t yet. And it\u2019s not by itself conscious as some of the other poses are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">THERAPIST: We should stop now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I hope you feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
