It\u2019s not a big deal. But just the idea that it is kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">of bothering me. I feel irritated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: When I wear my retainers now it either really hurts or it feels really itchy and shit.

I think it was because these fucking guys. I went to my friend\u2019s jazz thing in Cheshire. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: This was Friday night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I walked so, you know, I wasn\u2019t thinking at all about drinking or why walk there. But the jazz thing was only wine and I don\u2019t really like wine. But I will do white wine or whatever. So I had white wine. Okay. Then we went to the local bar around the corner and then I was having beer, lite beer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Okay fine. But these guys, when they showed up they start ordering shots of vodka.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: And pretty big shots of vodka. And I didn\u2019t have a whole one myself but I, you know, I took a lot of sips.

That is just not. So I think I definitely was drunk by the time I fell asleep. But most of the night I just felt buzzed but I didn\u2019t feel, you know. But then when I woke up it was just like, \u201cWow.\u201d I mean. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: How were you feeling that night being out and about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Okay. I mean I think this thing had already kind of started. It was the day after I had [come to the] (ph) emergency room for my Mom. I was just, you know, just a lot on my mind, man. Just a lot going on right now. And it is just a lot to process. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: But it was okay. You know?

You know, \u201cWow, it is really nice outside.\u201d Do you know what I mean? Like it is hard to gage. Yeah, it\u2019s bothering me but, I don\u2019t know, I am not knocked on my ass or something. I can\u2019t tell how (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: I am just kind of, I am a little kind of blah, I guess. I don\u2019t know. It is hard to explain. I don\u2019t know. I had a great practice last night. You know? I think it goes back to what you said. It is no longer a thing about like, \u201cToday I am down.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: But I feel like any one day I seem to have these (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: But that is also ordinary.
