Fucking nightmare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t that bad, it\u2019s just funny. They finish one place and then they immediately pop up somewhere else. It\u2019s so funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I was thinking the one thing that is bumming me out is my band situation. There\u2019s a bummer.  That\u2019s a tougher\u2014it\u2019s almost tougher to say good-bye to that than my family \u2013 especially my friend Stu. That\u2019s not a reason to stay, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">What I\u2019m reminding myself of is that things have changed so much, now. In a way, we could still \u2013 if we wanted to, I could send him tracks. It\u2019s not a big deal anymore. It wouldn\u2019t really be a band feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I have to remind myself that it would be like the Tara (sp) situation. If I gave up Assyria to stay here until I found some guys to play with, that\u2019s not\u2026 [000:02:03] Stu\u2019s married. It\u2019s not like they want to hop in a van. They probably would the ones, eventually, to be like, \u201cMan, I can\u2019t go on that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">tour.\u201d Not in a bad way! It would be silly of me to expect\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">In other words, they\u2019re serious about it. At the same time, they have real other obligations and marriages and this and that. It would be really shitty if, later, I was like, \u201cWait, I didn\u2019t take that opportunity because I wanted to make sure I could play Quebec?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">It\u2019s a bummer. They\u2019re so into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">I think what I\u2019m going to do is tell them the truth, which is that I really am leaving temporarily\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t know how long. That it\u2019s really a hiatus kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: What are you going to be sad telling about it? Stu?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really hard to find\u2014it\u2019s mostly Stu. The other guys are nice guys, but Stu and I? It\u2019s hard to find that kind of somewhat\u2014it\u2019s like a girlfriend. Someone you get along with so well who you also have this awesome chemistry. Nothing\u2019s ever weird; I don\u2019t have to tell him what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">That\u2019s a bummer. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not going to find that in Assyria, but it\u2019s highly unlikely. They have great musicians, but not\u2014Assyria doesn\u2019t know what the fuck indie rock\u2014they don\u2019t know what those sensibilities and aesthetics are.  There, I would really be a solo guy telling people how to play <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">\u2013 when then I probably wouldn\u2019t even do. I\u2019d probably just play acoustic \u2013 yeah, I\u2019d just do solo stuff. I\u2019m sure maybe that\u2019s what I need to do, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">It\u2019s hard enough to meet someone like that. It\u2019s almost is like you\u2019re like, \u201cBut if I leave, he\u2019s going to find some other band, because he\u2019s great. Then he\u2019s not really going to want to play with me or he\u2019s going to move on.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I know, also, that\u2019s it\u2019s a bit immature. Stu loves the songs. (inaudible at 00:04:51) going to be bummed, but\u2026 He\u2019s also the kind of guy that we could pick it right up where we left off if I came back.  Or that we would come up with a plan to send each other files. People do it. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just a bummer. What are you going to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like he feels that way about you, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: That it really clicks, (crosstalk at 00:05:36)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They all do, they all do. To me, Stu is the core member of the band. The other guys are totally replaceable.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561590\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">We were even talking about it last night. He was saying how he wants to maybe replace them. We like them as people, but Grey (sp) is not really a drummer and Philip (sp) is not really a bass player, so they\u2019re not really playing their main instruments, so it doesn\u2019t sound quite\u2014that\u2019s the other thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">I like about Stu, we\u2019re both very\u2014it\u2019s not like a hobby, where we\u2019re hanging out.  We know what we want to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">It\u2019s hard to explain. I don\u2019t have to explain the nuances. He just gets how it should sound. We\u2019ve been recording\u2014he and I have been doing this, he comes in and he\u2019s basically recording me. He\u2019s not playing that much on this. It\u2019s working out really well. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:06:42), go find another band (inaudible at 00:06:46)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not that it would be easy. I\u2019m saying that if he wanted to, he would be scooped up quickly because he\u2019s super-talented and a really nice guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">The thing I know is that they\u2019re not\u2014they\u2019re also really into it, because the songs are really, really good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">I\u2019m just trying to remind myself that I can\u2019t let it be like that Tara, what happened with Edinburgh \u2013 I can\u2019t do that. The opportunities in Assyria very much outweigh\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">The thing is, realistically, what are we going to do, anyway? With music in the States, you have to have some fluke YouTube hit. Or you have to constantly tour. Really, all we would be doing is being a good band that whoever hears us really likes but\u2026 Okay, yeah, we play San Diego, we do this, we do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">that. I don\u2019t know\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">In a way, I think Stu\u2019s in denial a little bit, too. It\u2019s like, \u201cDude, are you really\u2026? You just got married.\u201d At some point\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:08:08) tour the country?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That opportunity (crosstalk at 00:08:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We can\u2019t do a Saturday night in San Diego and come back. At some point, you really have to be out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">So there\u2019s that, too. And, according to some of my friends, they\u2019re like, \u201cBut, you\u2019re going to \u2013 even musically \u2013 you\u2019re going to reap a lot more reward in Assyria than you are here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">I think all it is, is just sad. I really like them, it\u2019s a great\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:08:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I love our practice space.  They\u2019re going to be bummed, especially Stu. I think Stu is going to be bummed. He really looks forward to being there and hanging out and doing our thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">On the other hand, I\u2019m also going to save that money that we spent on the space. They\u2019re all little things. That\u2019s a big thing: car insurance, gas. Obviously, some bills, it doesn\u2019t matter where you are \u2013 credit cards or whatever. It\u2019s a huge \u2013 even here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">Some things that I\u2019m happy to give up, other things that I\u2019m not; but at the end of the day, it is still money that I\u2019m not spending. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">That, alone, is not a reason to move to fucking Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Because you could do that here, too. You could (crosstalk at 00:10:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah, I could just cut things out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:10:11) and stop this, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying more to look at the silver lining would be to some of the losses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">The big thing, though, is I know enough now to know that it\u2019s also fear. I mean, really, what am I giving up? Like I said, we\u2019re not\u2014Grey and Philip aren\u2019t good enough. We would have to replace them, if we wanted to really make it sound exactly the way we want it to sound.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561590\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">That\u2019s one, and two, then, once we did that \u2013 what, we\u2019re going to hit the road for a month?  There are things we\u2019d have to do that I don\u2019t see happening. Even on my end. How would I leave for a month? It\u2019s not easy around here. That\u2019s a big, big, big commitment. You don\u2019t have to do it year-round, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">but you do have to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">That\u2019s not going to work, so what it is it? We would just be playing regionally and just releasing stuff, hoping that we get enough traction. What\u2019s going to happen, we\u2019re each going to make $500?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">I think I have to start thinking of myself as a songwriter who can be anywhere and perform. I just like the feeling of a band, but I think my friends are right: bands come and go.  And it\u2019s true: all the people I like, their bands change all the time. But you\u2019re going to see them; they happen to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">a good band, that\u2019s great, but you\u2019re going for their songs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s sad, something that feels (crosstalk at 00:12:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: You know, it is and it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a bummer. This is a true bummer. I don\u2019t like that word. When I really think about it more carefully? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: It can be exciting and sad, right? I\u2019m just making\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Wait, which part is sad? The band thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: The band \u2013 or Stu, even, just Stu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s more of a personal, just as a friend. Not so much as the band, but yeah, I really enjoy the guy, he\u2019s a good guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: That sounds like it\u2019s a place where there\u2019s something actually good and comfortable here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yes, right, and productive and artistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:13:25) good about it.

But I think it\u2019s a necessary bummer. I think this is also going to force me to, like, \u201cYou know what, dude? You have to just grab your guitar and play it, sorry. There is no band to cover up your fear of whatever.

I\u2019m a lecturer at the university, so now I\u2019m working on my book.\u201d I think these things are connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Even just getting up to teach a class, you bring all your other work with you (crosstalk at 00:31:48) there\u2019s a day planned out, it forces you (inaudible at 00:31:53).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a motivator.

I already feel\u2014with the music, with the writing, with everything. It\u2019s more like there\u2019s a purpose now, somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">Again, I think that has a lot to do with a clean break. Even here, like yeah, Dean College, UConn \u2013 there\u2019s something about that, even adjuncting. It\u2019s nice, but I think because it\u2019s here, somehow\u2014I go and teach, but then I come back, and it\u2019s like, \u201cHere we are, Cheshire, and the family, and the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201591\">fucking people I\u2019ve seen for my whole life.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Drawing you back down into the vortex that (crosstalk at 00:33:16).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so you\u2019re still a kid. It\u2019s like you\u2019re regressing. Every time you leave whatever you\u2019re trying to build, then you go back into like, \u201cHere\u2019s Brian (sp),\u201d or, \u201cLittle Brian,\u201d or whatever. It must be whatever a lot of people feel in their hometowns. That\u2019s why they get the fuck out of there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D1\">at least for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">Whereas it would be different if I came back much more established. You\u2019re not depending on anything other than what you\u2019ve built for yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: You had space to build your own identity, (crosstalk at 00:34:05) it\u2019s solid enough that you can bring it back (crosstalk at 00:34:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: They can come back and enjoy. Then when you go back to Cheshire, it\u2019s just nice to be back in Cheshire. It doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t have to live in your house. You can find your own way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">Ultimately, ultimately, ultimately, ultimately? Now I can\u2019t wait for Christmas, because it\u2019s going to be so great to tell all these fuckers that, \u201cSee you! See you! I\u2019m out of here!\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cOh, because it\u2019s a completely [immoral ass] (ph) fucking society!\u201d I\u2019m going to kind of say that.
