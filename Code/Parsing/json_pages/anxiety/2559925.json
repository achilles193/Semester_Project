What? How so? What do you notice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I guess I could compare it to like going to class in the sense that I've never really thought about it this way, but I suppose it can be phrased as almost feeling like I have to be able to come here and sort of perform or something. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Well. Perform. Yeah. Perform? What do you mean perform? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't even know. I guess just it's a time that I need to be able to, (pause) to think. Not even just to think, because I do that all day. Do you know what I mean? But this is I guess I feel a certain amount of effort is required to be able to do well here or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Which sounds weird to say.

What? How do you know you're doing well? What feels like you've done well? You know, that kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: There are definitely times that I've left here feeling like I've done well and times that I've left here feeling like I didn't do well. I mean, that's very evident to me. I think a lot of the times when I say to you, \"I feel like I'm rambling.\" Which I think I notice I say sometimes. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200531\">like that's a way for me to express me feeling like I'm not doing well or something. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: But I think I judge it off of you. I think. A lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What my reaction is to things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I think I judge your response to things that I say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: Or body language, stuff like that. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: And then I, based on that I feel like I've performed well, or I have not performed well, or been interesting, or I've (pause) Yeah, I guess it has a lot to do with my impression of how you've been moved by our fifty minutes together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, are there certain things about my reaction that, you know, you're in particular looking Like is it how interested I seem to be?

It's something that I feel pretty strongly but I guess I couldn't articulate as clearly as I seem to feel it.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely something, it's definitely a way that I sort of view this fifty minutes. You know? I better be on my game or something. I think the closest thing I could compare it to would be like going to class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Well what element of going to class? Like you're going to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: I couldn't go to class You know, if I was going to class and there was going to be a discussion that day, I'd want a cup of coffee first. You know? I'd want to be well rested because it wouldn't be good to go to class and not perform well. To not do the things that you come to class to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200831\">well. Do you know what I mean? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: What the, if it was a discussion? Are you thinking about a particular kind of class?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: I'm thinking about just my classes with Kaley (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Oh okay. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: I'm thinking about it. I guess the way I'm trying to like I would separate this from like me being at home and like just sitting down and thinking and relaxing. I wouldn't call this my relaxation time. It's not that. You know what I mean? It doesn't mean it's bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">There's a lot of things that are not relaxation time that are good. But in the sense that I see this experience as something that I am, in the same way like at class, that this is like I don't know how to phrase it. (pause) There's a sort of like a higher kind of authority or something that I am appealing to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: As opposed to setting the terms or something. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Like a kind of evaluation that's going on that you're aware of that you're (cross talking at 00:09:08)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. An evaluation, I think. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: Definitely something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: I feel like I'm free to talk about anything I want here, but with that freedom I feel like I just try to talk about the things that are worth talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">CLIENT: Based upon what I suspect you think is worth talking about or interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">CLIENT: That's what I would do with that freedom. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It kind of reminds me a bit of like you wondering, \"Am I going down the right road if I'm talking about my Dad, or back earlier,\" kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's a similar. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I don't get that sense as much. I haven't gotten that sense about it lately about why you've been talking about your folks, or whatever. But it seemed like you would kind of mention that earlier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">CLIENT: Maybe it's still there, that element. There was definitely a shift, you know, towards me feeling more comfortable talking about it. But I think it could probably be said that I may have just started to feel more comfortable that it was something worth talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Based upon my reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">CLIENT: What you would consider worth talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B5\">CLIENT: So in a sense I was still sort of playing that game.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559925\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking about it, I guess, in one way of like you knowing that I'm going to be with you, or I'm going to be I mean it has a lot of me in it, but one thing is that I'll be kind of engaged and stay wanting to have some participation. Maybe there's elements of approval, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">but I guess when you say interest I was thinking about that. Huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Wanting me to participate. Wanting me to be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause) It's funny. There's something I thought, I was thinking about talking about when I was doing what I do. Thinking about what I'm going to talk about when I come here as I'm walking here. And I kind of did what I usually do. I think about what things happened in the last day or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD1\">two that I could, you know, search for some significance in or something. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: Like, \"Here's this thing that happened with my Mom last night,\" or something. Maybe I can talk about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Ah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: You know, that could be something I could talk about here. But I kind of started to feel frustrated with that. I felt (pause) I felt I didn't want to be doing that anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: I didn't like that I was doing that. I didn't like that I felt compelled to do that. Do you know what I mean? And I started just thinking about, you know, other, just a different way of talking about things here. And I guess one of the things I started to think about was certain things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C91\">would be very hard for me to say here to you at times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">And the thing that I kind of like, I think that I feel and think on some level a lot, but I don't ever actually even consider it as something I could talk about here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: And I started to think about it and I just sort of starting playing around with little images in my head. And one of the things that I think I kind of stumbled upon, which I thought was interesting, was that Maybe this isn't totally different from other things that I've said, but I've been <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF1\">coming here for a long time.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Keeping things cool.

And, you know, you sort of said, \"Didn't you know about this?\" You know? (laughs) You were asking me, \"Did I know about this?\" And in some way it just felt, I could tell there was something about it that you didn't feel right about. The way I handled <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201EB1\">it or the way it came about. I wonder if in some ways there is something about that too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201ED\">Well maybe not the reason, having it being a reason or anything that you feel frustrated or something. But there's something about that being maybe a case in point of you feeling like, \"Can I really go there.\" Can you really go there with me and tell me what all that meant to you and what it felt like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EF\">I mean, you did.

You said something to me that I didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2024F1\">know about and was unfamiliar to me. You know?
