(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Good, thank you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So I was wondering about what we discussed last time on Friday. I guess instead of saying I got what I deserved, maybe I should say I got what I wanted. (laughs) Like I think subconsciously, or maybe not even so subconsciously, like one part of me is quite aware of what I'm doing and perhaps, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">you know, wants to do what I'm doing. (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And the other part is so ashamed of that, you know, the part that's maybe more real and judgmental is kind of taking the first part to task.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (laughs) A little bit. (pause) Yeah, I mean I guess in the back of my head I wanted to kind of, you know, explore. And let me know if I'm making excuses again. (laughs) But like I guess I wanted to explore like what it feels like to have like a Bohemian friend. (sniffs) You know? And a friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">who was, you know, only interested in sleeping with me instead of anything more than anything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">And I'm interested in all the other stuff. You know, the buildup before that, because that's the bit that I don't get from Chris (ph). So maybe I'm, you know, aware. Maybe I'm not that naive. That I know that, \"Okay, this guy, you know, he wants ultimately that. But, so we'll see if it gets to that.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">And it didn't. (laughs) You know, because he sabotaged his own seduction by being so negative. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: But I wanted that. I wanted to be taken out and like (sigh), yeah. And I guess I also didn't care if it ended badly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I mean I guess I knew the worst that would happen is that I would lose this friend. I mean, of course I didn't want that to happen, but I think I stopped caring for Graham long ago. Like he hurt me. Like when I first met him he said he had a crush on me but I had a boyfriend at that time. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">I could just pick that this is not a guy I would want to be with. You know, because he was ten years older and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And I was much younger then, so it's like But I still knew like, and I think I was starting to have interest in him and he was just kind of was flakey himself, even though he called everyone else flakey. Anyway, I'm getting away from the So, I guess what I'm thinking is I knew I wanted this and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">I went ahead and I got it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">And then, you know, I'm like, (sigh) I guess last week I was a little surprised and shocked when he did break off the friendship. You know? (sniffs) Do you think it's helpful to say, \"I got what I wanted,\" instead of saying, \"I got what I deserved?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I'm trying to think of the helpful part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: They each speak to a particular kind of psychological state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: And they both have truth to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: I was commenting on your saying that about, \"You got what you deserved,\" not because I didn't think it was helpful. I was commenting on a particular kind of psychological state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Where that was your retribution for having done wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And that was a psychological state you were feeling. And today it seems like you've, or over the weekend also, you reflected on what it means what you did, and maybe there was a part of you that wanted that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559558\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: And so it speaks to that psychological state. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like, yeah. You're putting it very nicely. (laughs) Yeah, so the part that wants retribution on myself I think infantilizes me a little bit and makes me feel a little helpless. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: So I'm wondering if I just get the two parts of myself, the wild part and the judgmental part to talk to each other (laughs) and be, you know, kinder to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And not have a wall between them. And like, well one part doesn't know what the other part is doing. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So I just wondered. Like and stop lying to myself a little bit. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: That would be, it's help that's probably Then I'll stop obfuscating and like be a little clearer in my head. (pause) Yeah. (sigh) It's nice to be on your own. I mean, (laughs) I was on my own this weekend. So like I didn't make much progress with work, but like it gives you certain clarity. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">You know? It makes you like come to terms with certain things. (sniffs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">And like so I think from our conversation last week, the thing that really makes me want to explore more of this with you. It's like, you know, the reasons why I hate Chris (ph). (laughs) Like this tissue (ph) is really bad for my back. (laughs) Yeah, the reasons why I hate Chris (ph). Like that is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">the reason why I don't want to move forward with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">And, I mean, like Sorry, I'm trying to (inaudible at 00:07:39) (laughs, pause) Yeah, so what you said that, you know, he's more successful than me. Right? Or superior to me. And I feel jealous or I hate him because of that. (sniffs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I never said he's more successful than you. You feel he's more successful than you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's what I feel. I think you said he's superior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I think I used the word superior though. You're right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: What did you mean by that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: You feel him to be superior. I guess successful goes into that. But then superior has also some other connotations besides successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: He's better than.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Superior intellect, superior motivations, superior discipline, superior status.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I just wondered like if I could get over that. (laughs) I'm becoming very much like that. I feel like anyone I meet and then I ask them personal questions, and then if I find something they have that I don't I automatically feel something inside me go, \"Oh! Okay.\" You know? \"You're <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">better.\" (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">Like I take this stance of rebellion slash judgmental. Like I have to prove myself that I'm better. Or I have prove that your standards don't apply to me. You know, if you're richer than me that just means that you're, you know, a horrible capitalist. And like, you know. (laughs) Yeah. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">It makes it hard to like people. I have to like bring them down a little bit. Like I have to humanize them. I have to find that story in their life that makes them seem human. You know, like so Chris (ph) had cancer as a child. So I keep thinking of that story to make him and his mom look less. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: You know, they look vulnerable and like people I can relate to and feel sympathy for. Because I feel like I can't sympathize otherwise. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559558\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: What kind of cancer did Chris (ph) have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Oh just a tiny like tumor. He was like eight or something. (sniffs) But it was found quickly and taken care of and Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: I'm just wondering. You never mentioned it before. I didn't know how much of a part of his childhood it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Maybe like a year or so. Yeah, you know he lost his hair because of chemo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: So, (sniffs) but that was a short amount of time. He's very humble about it. He's like, \"Oh, yeah, my Mom had to deal with all of it.\" (laughs) \"I didn't really have to.\" But I keep thinking of that and like so I can sympathize with him. You know? (laughs, pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">Something you said earlier that everyone has experienced sorrow. I don't have like a specialty (sniffs) in having experienced sorrow. You know? That's not my expertise. (laughs) So I was wondering if I could stop thinking in those terms. You know? Deprivation and like not having had stuff and what not. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">And that makes me act like, or feel inferior and, therefore, rebellious. And therefore -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Jealous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, and jealous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: You can experience jealousy very acutely. They have something that I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sniffs) (pause) I don't know what the solution is. Maybe just feeling pride in what in what I have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Right? But I don't feel, I don't feel it. Like Chris (ph) was saying yesterday that he derives a lot of sense of worth from working. I really don't think in those terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: I don't think in terms of worth. What is worth? What does it feel like? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Do I really not know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Maybe you don't. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Have I ever spoken about in those terms? Like worth? I don't think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: You think about what that could mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You don't always refer to it to yourself. Although you think about treating yourself more generously or with more generosity. I think that is related to worth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Why would you be generous to something that's worthless?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: That's true. (sniffs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: But you're wondering about it. Like this concept feels a little different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I don't have experience with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: I feel, this may not be worth, but like I feel a sense of power a little bit. And when like guys like me or express interest in me. (laughs) So, yeah. There's like that high you get for like a few minutes or maybe longer. (laughs) I don't know if that is worth. You know? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">And I think we've talked about how I feel very uncomfortable when people compliment me. So if that might be related to not knowing what self worth means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: (pause) I feel like I don't know what to do with, you know, when people, \"Oh, you did this well. You did that well.\" And I immediately look for excuses and say, \"Oh that's nothing,\" this and that. And I guess it's good to try to be humble, but I don't know if I'm actually humble. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm. What do you think you are actually?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Confused and messed up. (laughs) Wanting to get attention and then when I get it I don't know how to behave. (laughs, sigh, long pause) I guess worthy means something like you earn it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559558\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Right?

I guess that assumes though that worth is based on merit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: It shouldn't be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: I don't know what it should or shouldn't be. (laughs) I'm trying to understand your way of thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But then the question is, what does it mean if someone just has intrinsic value? Is it that they've merited that value or do they just have intrinsic value or intrinsic worth? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: That would be talent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It's still very performative of a definition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Well, it's Chris's (ph), it's not mine. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Are we here to work on Chris's (ph) definition of things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: No, we're here to work on mine. But mine are coming from somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: I can see that I said that because I'm familiar with that. Like I've heard people say, \"Oh you're talented,\" and this and that. And I've been okay with that because it's something intrinsic. It's something that I'm lucky to have. But it also at the same time makes me feel like, \"Oh! You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">I could go either way. I could not realize my talent or I could.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">And, you know, that is too scary to think about. So it's just like, okay, I'm just like I have talent and I don't know what to do with it. (laughs) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: What about the woman who made you pie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: It sounds like she has intrinsic worth in her ability to make other people feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Is that a talent? A talent sounds so performance based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: A talent is something that can help you to do something well. It's performance based. Whereas her worth in making other people feel warm is not quite a performance. It's something more intrinsic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: It's not performative? I mean she has to work, like has to do those things. She has to make the pie or buy it and put it on the plate and say those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Right, but maybe someone could make pie and not give you that same feeling. I don't think it's about making the pie. It's about I guess I'm sort of wondering whether we could think of value as something more intrinsic to the person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: And not simply something that they can then do something with in order to accomplish. Your definitions are still very accomplishment based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: Mm. So you mean they run the risk of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I hadn't thought about it running the risk of. I guess if we put it that way, I guess it runs the risk of sort of having an extreme evaluative aspect to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Then your value has to be evaluated in order to determine if it's really value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: Like if you don't do something then you don't have that worth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. From your definition if it's all performance based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">THERAPIST: You're either, you know, performing well, exceeding expectations or under performing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT: That's actually how I judge people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559558\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: I mean is being a good person a talent? You know, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Being a good person very complicated. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: But like I think it depends on what you're doing at that moment or that week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Maybe you're just being a good person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: (laughs) That's not useful, you sitting around being a good person (laughs) in your own home. Right? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Useful to whom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: To the society. To me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Well hopefully you're ready (ph) to be useful to other people, but you're also doing for your own I have to sneeze. (sneezes)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: accommodations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: You know, acclamations and so forth. So if you're doing something for your own, to be acclaimed or appraised, is that useful? It's useful to you. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: I'm just begging, I'm just sort of looking at the issue of, well, what if you're not being useful? There's a lot of things that you would like to do that are not necessarily useful in and of themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: I want to scream right now! (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: Chris (ph) is in my head! (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Chris (ph) is in your head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah! Take him out! (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">THERAPIST: What made you think of that at this moment? How is he in your head right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: Well, the whole thing of being useful or not, it's totally his! Like I've started judging people like that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">THERAPIST: Why do you like this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: Did he come out? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: Like, you know, if you shake your head like kind of you're getting water out, maybe he won't be stuck in your head. Maybe he'll come out your ear canal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">CLIENT: No I think he's really entrenched in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">THERAPIST: He's just lodged in there a little better than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">CLIENT: (sigh) Clingy fellow. (laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">THERAPIST: Sorry, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">CLIENT: I said, \"Clingy Fellow.\" (laughs) No I was just thinking of my Mom when you said that. And like that's how I judge her. Like, \"Okay, so what have you done this week that is worth my liking, you know, you?\" or, you know. Like it felt weird yesterday. Like it was it was Mother's Day and then I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201451\">thinking, \"Pfft.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">You know, she hasn't been a Mom to me for a while now. (laughs) Forgetting all the nice things that she does. And, again, like this performative thing that you're saying. I should celebrate her just because. You know? I bought her flowers and stuff and it was like so weird and like unemotional. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201471\">just handing it to her and like, \"Okay.\" (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">But the person I did feel who had mothered me was, you know, the pie woman and I wrote her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">CLIENT: I made her a little card, bought her a little card and I wrote her stuff. But then again, that's a very performance based thing when I'm like, \"Okay, who's \" I mean, obviously I should thank that woman. But it shouldn't be like this comparative thing. Right? Like with my mother who hasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D1\">been able to be what I think is motherly. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">Like, yeah, it makes me unhappy when I judge people like that. I see what you're saying about like just sitting and being a good person. I do see those people and I like them just because I like them. Like this other friend of mine with whom I had a fight and made up with. I know she doesn't like me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F1\">as much as I like her. And, again, I shouldn't think this way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2014E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559558\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">So, I mean I just like her. She is a sunny person and, you know, I like seeing her. She doesn't have to do anything. She doesn't have to give me anything. And I sometimes fall in that trap where, you know, I was like, \"Hey, let's go to the mall next weekend. I'll be done with my finals and we can hang.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201511\">Because she's been wanting to go to the mall. And she said, \"No. I'm busy.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">And that kind of hurt me for a little bit. And then I was like, \"Wait a second. Why?\" You know? Like she has her own thing. You know, it's okay. (laughs) So this whole need based, performance based thing, I feel is a trap that I don't want to fall into.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: But I do all the time. (laughs) And I apply that same standard to myself all the time. Where, you know, it's like, \"Okay, so I didn't get as much done today. I am a hopeless, worthless person.\" (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: Yes. Right. It's about your being good or bad or valuable or not, based on performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah. How do I change that? (laughs) How do I try and be kind to myself and to people even though they haven't done anything to deserve that? You know? (long pause) So I guess I do derive a sense of worth from working. I just don't know it. I mean on days that I work well, I feel good. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B1\">must be worth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: Right? (sniffs, laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: I think you do. I think in lieu of that, when you feel like you haven't had a good day, then you feel terrible about yourself. So the worth is entirely, you know, performance based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">CLIENT: I'm sorry to be pointing fingers, (laughs) but I feel like it is Chris's (ph) kind of. Maybe I shouldn't say that. (laughs) Maybe it's entirely my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">THERAPIST: You weren't sorry about pointing fingers before. You were very happy to point fingers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">CLIENT: (laughs) Now I feel like, \"Okay, maybe I should stop.\" Maybe I should stop blaming him. I do that a lot. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">THERAPIST: But in it being Chris's (ph) fault it's as if you're helpless about who does or doesn't influence you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">THERAPIST: You're just like a little kid who could easily get influenced, so it's his fault. He influenced you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah. I do get easily influenced. That's always been the case from the beginning. (inaudible at 00:28:32) like, wait, I have my own judgments and I'm very stubborn. So shouldn't I use that to weigh my influences and take what I like? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: (sniffs) You know, this performance based thing is totally so that I can work faster or, you know, like be more dedicated. So I mean I have adopted that so that it's of use to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: How do you mean so that you can work faster?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">CLIENT: Well, like having a goal to work every day and basing my self worth on that so that I can be more productive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">THERAPIST: I think that is an illusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017F\">THERAPIST: I think it's an illusion to feel that if you have zero worth and then you gain worth by working, that somehow that's the motivation you need to work. And without it you wouldn't have motivation. I think that's an illusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: You could also feel that you have intrinsic value and whatever stems from you and grows from you and is created by you has a value. That could be motivation to work too. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20182-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20182-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559558\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: You don't necessarily need to be at a zero sum and then try to up your worth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah. You mean the work itself has value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Well, no, actually that you have value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: And that What you're saying is that if you don't feel like you have any value and you have to earn it, then you'll be motivated to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: But that's a vary sort of one definition of motivation and one idea of motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: As if if you didn't feel really good about yourself all the time I don't know if anyone feels really good about themselves all the time. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: But if you didn't feel good about yourself all the time, you know, that somehow you wouldn't be motivated to work. You'd just, I don't know, sit around and stare at the paint dry or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: Hm. (pause) I mean I think we've talked about it before. It's like I guess I don't do it all the time. (laughs, pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">So is this related to the jealousy bit? Like self worth is performative and some other person performs more than me, you know, has more worth and it's, you know, comparative, then obviously I'll feel, or maybe not so obviously, I'll feel jealous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">Instead of feeling that I have self worth too even though I may not have worked as hard. You know? (sigh) I just wonder. (long pause) Yeah, because basically like it's like I feel like at the heart of my issues with Chris (ph) is that I'm just very insecure. (laughs) So I guess I want to try to understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A11\">that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. How do you feel that that's at the heart of your issues?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT: Because people have observed this about me and that's the word they use and that's what they say. So I feel like, \"Okay, that validates (ph) it.\" (laughs) You don't think that of me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Mm mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">CLIENT: Oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Actually, I'm not sure what that even means, \"the heart of your issues.\" Does that mean that that's what creates problems in your relationship, that you're insecure? I guess I don't know what \"the heart of the \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: You know, I'm not sure what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: Mm. Our biggest issue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: I don't know. Biggest problem? Like if you were not insecure you would have a great relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Do that way to be true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: I don't know. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">THERAPIST: You've also said the opposite. That if you were more secure you'd realize you don't need him and you'd go pursue something that might be a better match for what you want and need. So you've said the opposite too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT: I'm totally confused. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Are you saying that in general or are you confused about what I just said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">CLIENT: No, in general. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT: I see what you're saying and I'm like, \"Oh God!\" This is like unresolvable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">CLIENT: Well that's what people see and I'm like, \"Okay, that must be true.\" Then I'm like, I don't know. (pause) I guess they don't see the whole picture. They don't know that I've said to you that if I was secure then I would realize I don't need Chris (ph). (laughs, pause) But it is true, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD1\">I'm very insecure. (laughs) I don't know!

And, you know, do things that everyone who is lost does. You know, sort of the way I am with Chris (ph).

Because I was just finding specific things in the session. You said to me, \"How are these two things connected?\" You know, \"How should we figure this out?\" Which I translated as, \"Tell me what to do next.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20229\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2022B\">THERAPIST: And so I said, \"Okay.

I mean there'd be some getting lost in the beginning and then you find a thread and you pursue it.

Like I think he hangs his hat on a lot of sort external structure. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202331\">I imagine that without it he would feel lost as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20232-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20232-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559558\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20235\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, he says right now he's just so busy and doing things not because he likes them, but otherwise he won't have anything to do. Which is pretty scary for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20237\">THERAPIST: How are things staying busy for him as a type of distraction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20239\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023B\">THERAPIST: But he said that. I mean he said what you just said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And I mean he realizes that it's kind of bad, actually. It's just like, \"Wow, I made progress this weekend. \" [I should realize that] (ph) being busy is actually bad for you. Because like for me wanting to be creative, you cannot be I mean I'm realizing, that's why I'm hoping <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2023D1\">this is some sort of an answer, you know, like my way of doing things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023F\">But I cannot be busy, I realize. I cannot be judgmental, i.e., like have a performative definition, because like for ideas, good ideas, creative ideas to come and go they have to feel, there has to be like a looser space. And there has to be a lot of down time where you're just sitting in front of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2023F1\">river and just staring. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20241\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20243\">CLIENT: I think. And everyone needs that. Chris (ph) needs it too. (laughs) He's just realizing that. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20245\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20247\">CLIENT: Right? (laughs) I have to take a poll and make sure that what I've just thought of is not ridiculous. You're nodding so I guess it's not that ridiculous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20249\">THERAPIST: I think it's a nice way of putting it. I like the imagery of a looser space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2024B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Because busyness creates a lot of static.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2024F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20251\">THERAPIST: Static like on the TV when there's static.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20253\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20255\">THERAPIST: It's sort of a lot of noise that's distracting, but you can't hear yourself. There's no clarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20257\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like a nonjudgmental space is what is required for the flow of ideas. But I mean judgmental is necessary. It's just like, it's I guess that art just feels like the two sides always competing. And without the judgment you might produce crap. And then you'd be like, \"Oh, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202571\">is so great.\" (laughs) But with the judgment on all the time then you won't produce anything or finish anything. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20259\">I guess I see that but I don't see the bit about not feeling towered over by Chris (ph). (laughs) That piece is still there. (pause) I mean if you feel like someone is above you, why would you want to get close to them? Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025D\">CLIENT: Right?

Climbing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20263\">THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like the motivation is to be close. It seems like the motivation is something else. You know being with someone above you gets you to feel a certain way about yourself. It doesn't seem like you want to be close to that person, you want to get something from that relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20265\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's what I'm doing with Chris (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20267\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20269\">CLIENT: I mean over the years I've grown to love him.
