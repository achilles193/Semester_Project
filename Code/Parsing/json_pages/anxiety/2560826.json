It\u2019s nice and cool in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: It can go off and on. It can just have a visual and then the heat turns on when it gets cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Nice. It\u2019s okay. You can leave it on. So things are surreal, but I\u2019m trying to stay grounded. Things feel very weird or disconnected somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re smiling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all bad, but it\u2019s surreal. I\u2019m having trouble . . . Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know what to make of things, I guess, kind of. It\u2019s just kind of weird how things happen. I\u2019ve also had a new bounty of women that are suddenly propped up. One I actually really like. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">French, which is really cool, but I\u2019m not letting it dissuade me from my plan which feels good.  It\u2019s very healthy, but it is funny how that works. (pause) So I don\u2019t know; things are surreal a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Tell me more about surreal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s really no money, but somehow I\u2019m not completely . . . I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know what else I can . . . I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Meaning somehow you\u2019re not panicked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m bummed. I kind of am panicked in a weird way, but I\u2019m getting through my days pretty well, I guess.  (pause) I think what I\u2019m realizing is that the biggest thing going on, whatever feels surreal, it\u2019s all fear. I think it\u2019s all fear \u2013 both of failing and of doing well because I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">think of a reason not to go. I can\u2019t think of a good reason, like friends. That\u2019s not a reason. The band \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s kind of a bummer, but that\u2019s also not a reason.  It would be different if we were touring and we were kind of a working band. It sounds great. I\u2019m glad I found these guys. I\u2019m bummed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">but it can\u2019t be enough for me to pass up an opportunity to make real change. All I can think of is just fear. That\u2019s all I think of it as.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: When you say fear of success, what do you picture [in your mind] (ph?)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I think this is, not a final frontier, but it is kind of like a major threshold I\u2019m crossing because look at me here. I\u2019m not really writing. I keep starting and stopping. I\u2019m all over the fucking place. Something is going on here.  I feel like going there is an ultimate challenge to myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">that, man, in a completely alternate environment \u2013 totally night and day environment if you can\u2019t fucking focus and at least finish one project . . . That\u2019s the thing. I guess I have finished things here. I\u2019ve finished my music and stuff like that, but if I can\u2019t finish another book then what\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">on? Do you know what I\u2019m saying? There is something here; I\u2019m restless. I just cannot fucking get into the zone. Wait \u2013 what? You were talking about fear? Were you talking about that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, so the idea that fear of going there and being like this; going there and getting into a routine there. I\u2019m scared of that because then I don\u2019t know what else to do \u2013 psychoanalysis, moving, this, that. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on that I cannot just sit down, that I can\u2019t do things for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">extended periods of time. My dissertation \u2013 whatever \u2013 what is that? What\u2019s going on? I\u2019m scared of that. I\u2019m scared of going there and not doing my dissertation, just kind of being there and I don\u2019t know what to do. There\u2019s no easy thing; no one can say anything about how to combat that other than, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">hopefully, it will trigger some kind of focusing capabilities, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Maybe there\u2019s more for us to understand about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m leaving. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: We may be able to continue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: In a way it sounds like you\u2019re describing a feeling as facing the music for once and for all. This is the scripted place where you should be able to write. What if you go there and you still can\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: In other words, my whole big push this last few years is that I\u2019m an artist and I make no apologies for that, and I am \u2013 a book, records, but when I tell this to other people, they\u2019re very \u201cof course.\u201d I appreciate that. They\u2019re very quick to be like, \u201cOh, yes. Rough that you published a book <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">and you\u2019ve put out three records. You are a working artist.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You also know you\u2019re capable of more than this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I know that I\u2019m not even doing a fucking fifth, if that\u2019s an actual fraction. I don\u2019t even know. I\u2019m not even doing it. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not at my potential, so I think Assyria to me is exciting. Maybe that\u2019s the fear. Maybe deep down I feel like no, I think this is somehow really going to work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">(chuckles) Maybe that\u2019s scaring me that I somehow feel really confident about this, that somehow, something about the milieu there \u2013 that\u2019s a douchy word \u2013 but the atmosphere and the vibe and the fact that there\u2019s a subculture. Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s not Paris. Paris is almost make-believe Bohemia. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">It\u2019s Western Europe at the end of the day.  It\u2019s near Asia or whatever. You\u2019re out there. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying exactly. All I know is that I have this fear that I\u2019m absolutely right in going, which is a little scary to me that I feel confident because these days I\u2019m so hesitant to be so confident <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">about anything. I\u2019m always trying to temper myself so that I\u2019m not rushing into anything or being too impulsive or blabbing about something before it\u2019s even done. I don\u2019t know \u2013 whatever. So I\u2019m just in this wacky, hard to explain . . . I\u2019m trying to explain it, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200354\">too much. Maybe I\u2019m just overthinking it or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: You know there is a way you\u2019ve been ferociously identifying yourself as an artist in the last several years \u2013 at one level really embracing [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:10) \u2013 but I can also imagine that identity still being fragile inside yourself. It\u2019s not on a bedrock foundation of self-confidence <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">and knowing yourself. It has been, in fact, the opposite. Everything in your upbringing told you this wasn\u2019t good, this wasn\u2019t you, forget it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It\u2019s almost as if now that I\u2019ve fully accepted it, now I\u2019m even harder on myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: The fear is still there \u2013 what if I\u2019m not or what if this is still worthless? What if I\u2019m pursuing something that will never be how I imagine it? All of the voices that you grew up with \u2013 why would those not be looming large right now as you\u2019re about to take an even larger and more real step <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">towards that identity?  There is still self-doubt. I think you hold onto it, but it\u2019s tenuous that this is really you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: I think maybe that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m surprising myself or something because this isn\u2019t about grad school. I\u2019m just going to move and the job is not secondary, but I\u2019m trying to attain a way of life. I\u2019m trying to totally abandon this kind of pretty unproductive and monotonous routine <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">that I find myself in here where I just feel like I\u2019m spinning my wheels \u2013 even with the band. I love the band, but it\u2019s like what are we doing? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s great; but, really, what are we doing? These guys \u2013 what are they going to do, drop everything and go on a tour with me? You\u2019re probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">not, are you?  I guess we\u2019ll make a record, but then what? You can\u2019t tour to back the record up. In other words, the only way they would is if there was a lot of money where they could quit or we have to keep doing a Saturday here, a Sunday there. I feel like everything is like that here. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D3\">okay, I\u2019m writing, but I don\u2019t know. Then the city \u2013 you know today that stupid Sofra by my house? I\u2019ve been going there a little more often because my friend from Assyria is here from out of town. There are no fucking coffee shops. It is one of the few and it\u2019s okay, but I was here this morning to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D4\">meet the French girl at 8:30. It was great when she was there. We were just in our own little world, but my God, when I was waiting for her, it was like these frumpy, pasty, frizzy-haired kind of women were trying so hard to be happy.  It\u2019s all just yuck. They\u2019re eating these bullshit eat-pray-love <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D5\">books and blowing their noses and I was trying not to judge, but between that and the fact that the place is really a Turkish place and that they\u2019re taking things you can buy at the Assyrian store for $2 and selling them for like $14. (chuckles) And these idiots from Cambridge are like, \u201cOh, wow. Spices.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D6\">I said, \u201cWhat am I doing here? What am I doing here? I don\u2019t need to be here.\u201d It\u2019s good for these people. Good for them. This is their town. You know what? They\u2019re the majority. This is where they belong and I love it here, but I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">That\u2019s a bit of a superficial example. It is and it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s symbolic of how I don\u2019t connect. I don\u2019t connect to the hipster people working there. I don\u2019t connect to the frumpy douchebags there. There is no one other than when I go there with my few Assyrian friends. It\u2019s doubtful that in Assyria <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">I\u2019m going to just connect with everybody, right? There are a lot of annoying fucking Assyrians in Assyria (chuckles), but, again, I also know that there is a community of people like me there that has become ultra-clear just because so many disparate, random people have said the exact same thing and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">felt the exact same way while they were there and feel the same way about me going there. Something is up, like I\u2019m onto something.  I feel like I\u2019m rattling myself. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yes. I wonder if this is something about going back to the mother country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: The mother ship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah \u2013 symbolically, at least, another layer of what you might be saying is trying to find the mother you didn\u2019t have, the origin that could pull you back to recognition of you. You look at these people \u2013 frumpy, frizzy, whatever, these books \u2013 you don\u2019t see yourself. You don\u2019t see yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">recognized in these people so you feel tremendously alienated and alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Right. Whereas when I was in Europe, yeah, I\u2019m not German and I\u2019m not Scottish, but I definitely felt, in some way, totally more at home.  I don\u2019t know what that is exactly. I just felt like I got people more; they got me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Even if there may end up being a layer of going to Assyria that is just a fantasy and you find the same kind of feeling disconnected at some level, too, that starting to know that part of what you\u2019re trying to get back to inside yourself is recognition, non-judgmental recognition of yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">that never happened here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that is a huge one and I think part of that, connected to that is that this is the ultimate clean break. It\u2019s not going somewhere for grad school. I am moving. I\u2019m going to be an immigrant somewhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: A clean break from your actual mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, from family, from all this quicksand here. That allows me to kind of walk, but not run. I cannot fucking pick up momentum because I\u2019m just too mired in this crap. It\u2019s a little overwhelming. It\u2019s very exciting. This is it. That\u2019s a very adult move. That\u2019s not some kid. It\u2019s not me packing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">my car up and just driving off to San Francisco This is very thought-out, planned, with connections and people and a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: It almost feels so right that it\u2019s unnerving, kind of, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, when you\u2019re in a coma you could be going across the country and it doesn\u2019t even feel like much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t feel like anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: It actually sounds like it\u2019s healthy that you\u2019re scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: I thought about that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re alive in this. You\u2019re really thinking it through which means you\u2019re going to be aware of more feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: I having all the emotions you would have. I\u2019m going to miss people. What happens if I go there and it\u2019s a cluster fuck? What if I go there and it\u2019s fucking amazing and I never want to come back? Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yes. These are all the signs that you\u2019re doing it in an awake way instead of asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes. And as much as I have problems \u2013 I mean I love my family, right? I will miss them and they\u2019re older and my mom . . . These are big things. My grandmother, especially, but that\u2019s also why it feels healthy.  I\u2019m thinking of that and still wanting to go. That feels very mature to me. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">like this has just got to happen because who the fuck gives a shit? What \u2013 I\u2019m going to buy a ticket and come back? So? That never crossed my mind going to \u2013 isn\u2019t that weird? That\u2019s got to be PTSD for a kid to pack his car up and just drive off. I literally had no thought and, by the way, not just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">going there, but even while I was there, it never once crossed my mind that \u2013 oh, wait. I\u2019m not trapped here. I drove here. (chuckles) I could literally just start driving back or my mom will buy my ticket back or I\u2019ll work and I\u2019ll make the money and I\u2019ll just . . . But I just fucking slogged it out. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200633\">Three years, three and a half years; bizarre. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: That time without coming back here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: I came back once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: In three years? That\u2019s so striking, Brian, for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah because there must have been serious PTSD going on. I don\u2019t know what was going on, but no concept of not being trapped there and why am I in a place that I don\u2019t really like at all? (pause) So this is \u2013 forget it \u2013 that\u2019s not even a good comparison, but this is even night and day to London. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">London was awesome. I\u2019m glad I did that, but that was grad school and it was very last-minute. It wasn\u2019t thought out that well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And you weren\u2019t thinking about consciously thinking about your grandmother \u2013 what will happen to her while I\u2019m gone? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I didn\u2019t think of it as this kind of healthy, clean break or my goal was to go there and really somehow make sure that I don\u2019t have to come back and be under this umbrella again. Actually, I had thought of that, but it\u2019s grad school. How was I possibly going to do that with a student visa? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">And the Meredith thing I hadn\u2019t thought through all the way. Whatever \u2013 all that stuff. I think that\u2019s what it is. I think this feels so thought out and I keep trying, like with my friends I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m a little worried about this. What do you think?\u201d Each one of them is like, \u201cDude, seriously. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">all good questions. That all makes sense, but honestly, dude, there is nothing to worry about.  You\u2019re going to go. There are plenty of places to stay. People are going to hook you up. You already know people and then they\u2019re going to introduce you to a shitload of people; and then you\u2019re just going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F3\">to meet people because that\u2019s how it is there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Or because that\u2019s how you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s how I am. Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Not everyone meets people so easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Right. Maybe I\u2019m just super excited mixed with normal anxiety and nervousness and things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: Mixed with the absence in your history really of someone seeing you, seeing your talents, embracing it, believing in you, encouraging it. (pause)  It makes me think of one of your poems from your book I read a while back. You mentioned something in a way that you certainly alluded to here <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">but you never said it in this direct way that it is in the poem, where it\u2019s sort of a memory of your mother saying \u201cwe cut that noise out,\u201d something about you making noise with your playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, the piano.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: There is so much. Just that alone that captures what is not inside you from history, holding you as you make this kind of transition and step. It\u2019s been up to you to scramble together some semblance of self-esteem and self-confidence. It\u2019s not because someone was here saying, \u201cPlay more. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">You\u2019re so talented.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Except my grandmother. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Or someone there in awe of you writing songs. It\u2019s so unusual. It\u2019s so unusual that it wasn\u2019t upheld that you were gifted. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s the other reason. Forget my family, but even artistically. I keep getting e-mails and this and that. People are like \u201clove the record.\u201d I think I can\u2019t stay here because that kind of drives me nuts a little bit. Everyone loves my music. The poetry \u2013 fine. There\u2019s no money in poetry. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">I\u2019m fine with that. I published a book. Prestigious press. There will be another one at some point. It doesn\u2019t get to me as much. And I don\u2019t even know what it is.  I\u2019m not saying I should be famous or something, but that\u2019s starting to really bug me now, that I don\u2019t know how to make this just a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">bit more something, give it a little more traction out there somehow. I think moving is going to do that somehow. I\u2019m not even sure how, exactly, but I think just moving and playing these fucking songs with an acoustic guitar in places where they\u2019re not used to this kind of music but are, I think, hungry <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200833\">for more original, heart-felt, love American stuff, whatever, it\u2019s almost like working your way back here. Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s just maddening. It\u2019s absolutely maddening. It\u2019s great that all these people love it, but it\u2019s not amounting to really much.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: I wonder, as I just said what I said, one of the things that makes you associate really to how maddening it is, is that it is a sign, in a way, of what could have happened if you had had the support earlier. It is maddening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: Right. Right. Right. Yep. (pause) I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping, too. I\u2019m hoping this move will kind of calm the constant . . . I think that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m not able to get shit done here; it\u2019s because I\u2019m always thinking \u2013 not what\u2019s the point, but that whole time\/age thing. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">here somehow that really gets me. I don\u2019t know what it is, but okay, the PhD. All right. Then what? I\u2019ll be a 40-ish dude that just finished a PhD. I don\u2019t know. Something here with that, I can\u2019t just enjoy and just be like \u2013 great. I\u2019ll be relatively young overall and I\u2019ll still . . . I can\u2019t do it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">here.  That stops me from just enjoying the process and just writing because I\u2019m like, \u201cBy the time this fucking book, by the time it\u2019s really done, edited and it\u2019s the way I want it to be and to a publisher, we\u2019re talking two to three years.\u201d Do you know what I mean? So my mind starts racing. \u201cWhat <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200873\">the fuck? God, you\u2019re almost going to be 50. You know what? You\u2019re not really young. You\u2019re middle aged.\u201d It\u2019s hard for me to deal with any of that. Whereas I feel like somehow moving away . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: Perhaps the change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll be away from this, so somehow I can just be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I think one of the things that\u2019s important about noticing that is that it makes it clear that you\u2019re not just sitting with the facts here of being too old and about to die, but that there\u2019s something emotional here that you can get away from when you imagine going to Europe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: Wait \u2013 what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: The feeling you\u2019re talking about, your age and time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. It\u2019s an irrational kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah, or it\u2019s about something else here. The fact you can imagine it not being about that in Europe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: I\u2019m saying it\u2019s about what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s about my mind racing between the age that I am and that what could have been up to this point and that\u2019s just like deflating a tire, popping a balloon. Then I just sit there and I\u2019m suddenly tired. Thinking of those things just fucking tires me <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">and it kind of drains me. It\u2019s hard to be whimsical. To create art you\u2019ve got to be playful and all this shit. It\u2019s just not happening here.  I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Maybe it feel too close to the realm of it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s still happening. Your mother is still being critical or uncertain.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m surrounded by their elderliness and regrets and ugh. Whereas when you leave, you can be with some 60-year-old woman that\u2019s writing a book of poems and she\u2019s all \u2013 you know. Then you\u2019re like oh, yeah. Here we are. We\u2019re just doing things. Who the fuck gives a shit? That is completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">irrational, but here it\u2019s not irrational because that\u2019s all there is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Everywhere. My memories, everywhere I look is this heavy fucking don\u2019t-talk-about-age.

So it\u2019s hard for me to just imagine taking my time, writing a novel for four years, and when it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. Great. How exciting. No, because in my mind I\u2019m going, \u201cWhat the fuck? Are you going to be that old?\u201d What? Yes, you are going to be that old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s mostly when writers start finishing their novels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Look at Philip Roth, for Christ sake. But that voice in my head will be like, \u201cWell, yeah, but don\u2019t compare yourself with Philip Roth. He\u2019s lucky. He\u2019s been doing it since he was 22. His first book was published when he was 23.\u201d But that\u2019s neither here nor there; the man is still writing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A71\">What does that mean? Their voice will always play tricks. I\u2019ll look at this fucking band, 22-year-old assholes traveling the world. What does that have to do with me, in a way? Yes, maybe I could have been that, but you know what? I probably couldn\u2019t have been. I was a shy kid.  Everyone blooms at a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A72\">different time. Even if I had some encouragement, I might have still not. I had stage fright, but it\u2019s their voice that just wants to trip me up one way or the other. (laughs) Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re not aware they\u2019re wasting now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly, and I am, which is why I keep trying to do these seat-change type things to jump start. Generally it works. It\u2019s getting better and better and better and better, but I think this one is the big jumping the battery of the car battery. This is like the engine is ready to rev, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB1\">but this isn\u2019t the place, I think, and I think I\u2019m finally just accepting that in a healthy way instead of \u201cI\u2019ve got to run away\u201d or something like that.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: You were so afraid early on that psychoanalysis could be just a kind of repetition of this side of your family, just wallowing and venting and complaining about the past instead of that it could open up new adventures that were never possible before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. I think it can be that. I still think that, but if you\u2019re lucky to have an amazing person, doctor, it\u2019s life-changing. I\u2019m not skeptical of psychoanalysis, I\u2019m just skeptical of the douchebags that practice psychoanalysis. It\u2019s like anything. I\u2019m like that about anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">There are just a few in all fields that have the right combination of heart and the scientific whatever, like everything is there. It\u2019s not just some idiot in Birkenstocks telling you that you hate your mom or whatever \u2013 and take some Zoloft. Shit that, if you have any critical thinking, you\u2019ve already <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF2\">got a list of all that shit that you already know.  (pause) I\u2019m even noticing \u2013 and this is how I know that it\u2019s some symbolic nervousness \u2013 I don\u2019t want to fly. I\u2019m suddenly nervous about flying again.

I packed the car up and I left. It wasn\u2019t great, but I built some fucking serious character and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF1\">was very courageous to do that.

I\u2019m sure if I came back some day and was a professor at UConn \u2013 yes, I would still hate the system, but now I\u2019m making a real living.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You would feel like your life was really [worth something.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: Exactly. I might critique this, critique that, but I\u2019m living a healthy, kind of independent life that I\u2019ve made for myself. (pause)  And the other thing \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I mentioned it in here, but I\u2019m really excited at becoming really good at Assyrian. Did I mention that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: A while ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really fucking excited about that. There\u2019s something about that that suddenly I\u2019m just like \u2013 wait a minute. What? Why can\u2019t I express . . . That\u2019s hard. It bothers me that I can\u2019t have this conversation in Assyrian. I mean, I can, but it will be kind of clumsy. Parts of it will be really <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">smooth and great, then I\u2019ll be like \u201cwhat was that word for this and that?\u201d I\u2019ll use simplistic words for things that are really . . . I\u2019m tired of that. As an artist, I want to be able to fucking express myself because I think that I have things to say that are not for you. I have things that are kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF2\">of Assyrian-centric that might be \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 not helpful, but maybe some people want to hear them. I don\u2019t know.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s like the idea of finding a voice, even in here, that is your own \u2013 not for me, necessarily, not my language, just within your family. Being yourself; really individuating being you, even if I don\u2019t understand it. That doesn\u2019t make it wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: It is so much [way ahead of your mother] (ph?) because she didn\u2019t think it was right or didn\u2019t [get it herself or was judged.] (ph?) Not just more \u201ctell me more about it, then, because I\u2019ll know it then. I\u2019m interested in what you know.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Right. Or even worse, that the ultimate thing that they do, which is like \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to say. Good luck.\u201d It\u2019s almost like don\u2019t say anything, dude, because really what you\u2019re saying is \u201cI hope you don\u2019t fail. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s dismissive and kind of demeaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, because they\u2019re saying that about themselves, really. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Not at all open to the thought that they could learn things from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">CLIENT: What they don\u2019t have, which my dad\u2019s side has \u2013 my grandmother on that front, maybe though, she doesn\u2019t have that either \u2013 but just like Claire is quitting psychology to go to clown school. I\u2019d be like \u201cwow.\u201d Whatever I think of it, I swallow that and I\u2019d be like, \u201cYou know what? You look happy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF1\">I\u2019m so psyched for you. Can I come watch you juggle?\u201d Who gives a shit? This person, who has \u2013 not nothing to do with me \u2013 but is just a person, her world. If you want to fucking juggle bowling balls \u2013 go for it. I hope you\u2019re amazing at it because I love you. I think you\u2019re amazing and I want to fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF2\">come cheer you on while you\u2019re juggling balls. Do you know what I mean? Just let it be. Why does it have to be so heavy? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no money in that. A lot of these carneys are weird. You\u2019ve got to travel all over the place.\u201d  They go so deep into things. They can\u2019t just be like, \u201cWow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF3\">that\u2019s so cook that you\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re doing that.\u201d No. Nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560826\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">THERAPIST: A piece of what\u2019s missing then is actually trusting the other person\u2019s judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">THERAPIST: For example, that they\u2019re doing it may be for a good reason, even if you don\u2019t get it, that they\u2019ve thought about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">CLIENT: They have a brain.

The other day we were watching the TV. It was just on and Rufus Wainwright came on. I was like, \u201cOh, no shit? I played a show with this guy.\u201d My mom was kind of like \u201creally?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB1\">Like it didn\u2019t register somehow.
