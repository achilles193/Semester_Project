I\u2019ll start there in June and, you said you\u2019ll only be here for two weeks in June.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Well, three weeks. Let me, let me get my schedule and we\u2019ll... (pause) Let\u2019s see... Yeah, I\u2019ll be here the 2nd, the 9th, and the 16th, those three weeks. (client affirms) And I should, I\u2019ll have to confirm next week, but I should have a 5:10 available, ten after five, on Tuesdays. Is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">something that you might be able to use? (client affirms) Okay. Would you need, so, do you, yeah. Would you want... (pause) Let me see... I might also be able to do a 5:30 on Thursday, if you wanted to do the Tuesday and Thursday. Is that a possibility? (client affirms) Okay, let me... I need to double-check <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">that. I think I could do that. I\u2019ve... The other option would be potentially an 8:30 on Monday morning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Oh, this is for June or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: This is for June, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Okay. Um... Yeah. I have to see how things go in June like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, right? Are you talking about June? (client affirms) Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Start there... The second, probably. So, Tuesday, Thursday, or Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think, so Tue , again, I need to, the Tuesday time, I need to confirm, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll have the 5:10 on Tuesday. Then Thursday, I think it\u2019s either 5:30 or 5:40. I just need to confirm that. Will one of those two times...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, both will work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, my due date is the 21st (client affirms), so I plan on being here the week of the 16th, and then, yeah, then I\u2019ll be out starting the 23rd. (client affirms) So let me, I\u2019ll confirm all of those for next week, but we\u2019ll, so we\u2019ll keep our regular schedule through May and then look <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">at that for June. (client affirms) Okay? Very good. Then, in terms of my schedule coming back, it\u2019s a little bit, I might need to figure out a few things, but we\u2019ll, I\u2019ll definitely be in touch by, I would say, mid-July and then we can kind of take it from there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Sure! Not a problem. (pause) Yeah. (chuckles) (sighs) (pause) Still haven\u2019t told my mom about (chuckles) my plans and my job and stuff. (chuckles) I think I saw her last... Saturday; yeah, maybe Saturday. I\u2019m trying to... probably kind of... so... (sighs) Yeah, I was thinking about what we said <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">last time... (pause) about like, addressing the emotional like, underbelly of the conflicts. You know, I said, \u201cI thought I had said everything I wanted to say about the situation,\u201d but then I guess I just did feel weird and new, I guess, to acknowledge like, you know, that my ideal or my, kind goal <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">to kind of take care of her and... So I just, (sighs) I guess surprised by that, that, you know, that was there and that\u2019s like, a foundational sort of thing for me, but then also, the realization that that\u2019s just one narrative and life is much bigger than that narrative. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">You know, thinking of redemption and all that, but even just like, it\u2019s been so long or like, so much time has passed that it\u2019s funny (chuckles). You know, it\u2019s not really redemption. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know how to understand it, but like her not even like, reading my story and like, kind of like, \u201cOh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">yeah, I\u2019ll get to it!\u201d (chuckles) And me actually being like, proud of that, like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re not just that one silly little narrative we made ten years ago or whatever. You know, we\u2019re bigger and beyond that now.\u201d So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562590\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">Yeah, just wondered like, how is it that, you know, something that I wanted to do, and promised myself that I would do, now that I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m like, I feel burdened by it, you know? Like, how come I forgot that I wanted to take care of my Mom? Here I am, actually taking care of her. Like, here it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">is! It\u2019s happening, what I wanted! Here it is! You know? Then why did I forget to be happy? Like, yeah. How did that come about? (pause) I don\u2019t why I\u2019m kind of, a little baffled by it, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">(pause 00:07:30 to 00:09:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Where did you go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I was thinking what more to say about it. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">(pause 00:09:15 to 00:11:38)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">Yeah, I don\u2019t know what more to say about that. Yeah, you said to address the feelings, and I feel like I have, so... (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) Well, the positive feelings, at least. I don\u2019t know about, I don\u2019t know if I addressed the negative feelings. Maybe I have, at a different point, a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">time. (pause) I mean, I guess I feel like, \u201cWhy do people, why are they asking me to do this? I feel burdened!\u201d So that sort of thing is unspoken or like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">(pause 00:12:24 to 00:12:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(sighs) It\u2019s weird, what happens. Like, it\u2019s... It happens that I\u2019ve (inaudible) or a lot of things like, like it\u2019s this thing I want to do, and yet I, at the same time, feel burdened doing it. (chuckles) I guess it must happen to everyone. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">Like, I... thought of throwing Nelson (ph) like, a surprise birthday party and like, I want to do it and at the same time, I really don\u2019t want to do it. It\u2019s like, all the work and especially like, inviting friends, like his friends that I don\u2019t even know very well and like, e-mailing them and like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">it\u2019s like, feels wrong to do that, you know? Like, I used to throw parties for Chris (ph) and you know like, sort of feels wrong on that level, to be doing that for Nelson now. And like... yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">I want to do something nice, and yet... I don\u2019t know what Chris, what exactly I\u2019m burdened by. But yeah, I guess like, that it feels wrong and that... it\u2019s like... all these people. I just don\u2019t want to be seen, you know? Like, I don\u2019t want to be visible. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: (pause) You don\u2019t want to be seen; how do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Like, all these people, they are his friends and like, I feel judged by them or whatever. (chuckles) So... But it turns out they are quiet. They\u2019re not as judgmental or not judgmental in the same way as... like, Chris\u2019s friends or how I perceived them, or how I perceive Chris\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">friends, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess I have like, an overwhelming desire to be alone a lot (chuckles), sometimes. And this happens when I have like, a very full social calendar. So, it\u2019s like, then I\u2019m like, \u201cUh, two years ago you had no friends, and you were dying to have friends. Now you have friends, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">now you\u2019re complaining!\u201d (chuckles) It\u2019s just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean. Like, I feel like that\u2019s a pattern with me. It\u2019s like, I want something, and then I have it, and then I don\u2019t want it. (chuckles) I mean, this was true since I was a child. I don\u2019t know like, I remember my parents telling me, \u201cYou\u2019re like... you throw such tantrums, you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">this one toy. And then you get it, and then you lose interest with it.\u201d (chuckles) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same thing, but... I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like, I lose interest. It\u2019s more like, I feel burdened. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562590\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: By having it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like, why do I have it, and now it\u2019s almost like another thing to manage and, you know, think about, and perform at, and... to fail at, if something goes wrong. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know... anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">(pause 00:16:56 to 00:20:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re very quiet today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. I didn\u2019t really sleep last night, I think. I made some coffee. (chuckles) Yeah, if I can\u2019t think of what to say. (sighs) I just want to hibernate for like, the next month... and not see people or... (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And you would write during that hibernation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You would write during the hibernation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have, every single day I need to get some writing done. Otherwise... (chuckles) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Contact with other people is very stimulating for you, and sometimes over-stimulating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean like, it\u2019s like, you know, where maybe introverts think that, are you giving too much of yourself to people and, you know, you don\u2019t want to do that. I guess that, this, at certain points what I need to think and write are I really early cannot spend. And my brain is just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">occupied, you know? Like, I can\u2019t do stuff that takes brain capacity, and people take brain capacity. I mean, I\u2019m trying not to, but I try to be all like, like a breezy 27-year old with like very, you know, like a very clean slate and very few impressions or knots in their (chuckles) brain or whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">so... Like, just meet people and, you know like, breeze by. But I\u2019m not like that. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: So why do you try to do be like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: No, I, I\u2019m... well, maybe at some point I wanted to be like that. I was tired of being by myself and thought, it became quite poisonous, it did. (chuckles) Two years ago, but I feel like I\u2019m different from then. So... Maybe I\u2019ve had too much people time and not enough \u201cme\u201d time. I mean, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">just, you know like, I need to get work done, so... I feel like people are getting in the way. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">But, it\u2019s, I am also starting to kind of feel or see that... like you said about like, my mom\u2019s, like my interaction with her kind of perhaps defines or influences my interaction with other people. It\u2019s like it happens on a subconscious level, but now I\u2019m conscious of it. Like, I think, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">done, I do this for her, you know. Isn\u2019t that enough? Like, I don\u2019t want to do any more, you know? Like, I don\u2019t want to be there for anyone!\u201d (chuckles) Or even like, I may take it even more beyond or a different, in a different direction. It\u2019s like, I might even become hostile or like... and then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">you know, think like a victim. Like, \u201cNo one else has this situation and only I have this situation.\u201d Which, you know, probably is not true! (chuckles) So I have to not go down that route. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">Yeah, I was telling my current boss that... He had made a job offer, too, for the summer and I was probably more perfect, and I told him. I told him, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s actually really true.\u201d I was really happy about getting that job offer. I was like, much happier about that job offer than the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">one, because you know, it was full-time and it means it will take away more of my time. I was just so like, touched that he knew my situation and came up with the money for me for the summer. You know, it was like 20 hours and you know like (sighs) it was going to be perfect and I like, told him, Yeah... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">I find myself talking about my mom\u2019s rent and it was like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s going up,\u201d and this and that. He was like, \u201cWell... you have that burden.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhy did he call it a burden,\u201d you know? Ahh! I was like, \u201cNo, you know, you do what you have to do.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562590\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">But I was like, people see that. People see that I\u2019m burdened and why is that? Like, why am I not like, breezy and like... or I feel (ph) breezy then, you know, like another way of thinking of burden could be that I\u2019m grounded, I don\u2019t like, I have responsibilities and I\u2019m doing a good job managing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">them. Like, that could be a more positive spin on the same situation of being burdened, you know? Like, yeah, like grounded and in control, you know? And that\u2019s again different from being breezy and like, all la-dee-da, you know. (chuckles) But... Aspiring to be breezy might help me a little (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">from feeling burdened, but maybe that\u2019s not the right thing for me. Like, the right solution, maybe it\u2019s temporary. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">But yeah like, I keep reminding myself of people who are, you know, worse off, you know like, I know I shouldn\u2019t say it like that, but like, you know, my friend who has MS and like, you know like, I don\u2019t even know how she, what pains she has and like what difficulties she has. You know, so... I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">never tell her, \u201cOh, you\u2019re burdened by this disease.\u201d I would be more like, you know, like, \u201cYou\u2019re awesome!\u201d And you know, \u201cYou\u2019re... doing everything all of us are doing,\u201d you know? I mean, \u201cYou\u2019re no different, you\u2019re not, you know, limited in any way. So, you\u2019re in control and you\u2019re being good.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200612\">(chuckles) But I mean like, just sort of remind myself that other people are... like, they also have burdens, you know. Or, if you want to think of them that way, you could probably think of them more positively. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">(pause) But I do like, and this is that, the reaction that happens and like, after (sighs) like, my interaction with my mom. I mean like, I know, going to see her when I don\u2019t want to, I would just be like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough! No more! I have no time for anyone else. I don\u2019t want to see anyone else,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">or, you know... (chuckles) So... (pause) I mean, I try to like, do things for myself. Like, you know, telling myself, \u201cThe work I\u2019ll do for the party will only start at like, 5:00 or 6:00, you know. Like, and I won\u2019t work the rest of the day,\u201d so you know... You know, then I won\u2019t feel as burdened. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">(chuckles) I don\u2019t know; we\u2019ll see. So... (yawns)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">(pause 00:29:10 to 00:29:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">I don\u2019t know. I guess I go from one narrative to the other. (chuckles) I guess that\u2019s normal. But like, the more time I spend with myself, the more I feel like... I\u2019m reminded of who I am. (chuckles) Like, I had like, forgotten that. (pause) It\u2019s funny. I feel like I haven\u2019t wanted to be with myself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">to hang out with myself, in a really low time. But like, it reminds me of my childhood.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Did you like it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was mostly reading Nancy Drew\u2019s. (chuckles) You know, I mean, that was awesome, so... Or, yeah. Reading and, yeah, eating something, or just reading. (chuckles) Yeah, I remember that and I feel like... at first there was my Mom, and then there was my Dad. It was like... you know, why? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">(chuckles) He should not have, he should never have come back into my life. (chuckles) But... then there were books, you know, and that was good, you know, great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">Then, I discovered people and they were like... bizarre! (chuckles) It\u2019s like, even as a child, I feel like I remember being baffled like, \u201cPeople do this? People do that?\u201d Like, I feel like I was surrounded by weirdoes (chuckles) and weird characters! So, yeah. I always like, preferred like, David <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">Copperfield or Oliver Twist over, you know, my neighborhood friends. (chuckles) The neighborhood friends did not make any sense and made weird demands like, really weird demands that books never did, so... (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: What was weird about them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Well, I didn\u2019t have any friends like, you know, where we first lived, where I was, like the house that I grew up in, until I was, I don\u2019t know, 10 or something, or whatever. Then we moved to a different part of town and there were kids my age, or close to my age. They even at school like, people <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">were... What I remember is people getting me into trouble, people not talking to me, people looking down on my clothes and shoes, teachers being nasty and like... Yeah, people not eating lunch with me, or people... And then the neighborhood kids being very, very, very wealthy compared to me and like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200792\">them being really mean to me about me not having money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">Like, \u201cOh, we spend 20 rupees on crackers like, fire crackers. How sweet!\u201d You know? \u201cGuess, what we spent, our family spent on fire crackers? You know, 500 rupees and...\u201d (chuckles) You know it was like, really, really nasty, you know? Like throwing my books and like, ripping my books and like, yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">Then, you know, later on, me being friends with these same people and this woman like, you know like, doing sexual stuff to me and all the other kids. (chuckles) So... it was like, yeah. Childhood friends at that time were all about power play and like... yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You were a target.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Again, I\u2019m not trying to like, say I didn\u2019t have any agency. I did and... (sighs) I manipulated, tried to manipulate people I could, maybe like my mom like, you know, like going and like, running up to her crying and telling her, \u201cShe did this, she did that.\u201d (chuckles) Instead of holding <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">back or like, trying to fight back on my own. I don\u2019t know, I was told I was emotionally blackmailing my mom or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: By who, by your mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Probably, or one of her friends, or my Dad, or someone. (therapist affirms) Yeah, my dad like, as soon as he came on like, my world just like, went from white to black. (chuckles) Yeah, he came and I feel like the next day like, okay, he might have been nice to me one day and then the next day <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">he was like, burning my books and like... telling my Mom, I\u2019m cunning and I lie and (chuckles)... It\u2019s like, I was, yeah. I went from being in hell into being in hell, so... It\u2019s like, you know, you\u2019re aware of only nice things and nice motivations and you know like, even when you\u2019re doing something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">like, you know, telling your mom you need this or you know, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t move; can you get me this?\u201d You know, that being innocent and the child\u2019s play; from that turning into, from his vantage point, evil and cunning and manipulative and, you know (chuckles)... I had like, lost my innocence as soon <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200833\">as he came on the scene. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562590\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: How old were you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: Six, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: This was the first time he came back.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t remember the story at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: Well, he\u2019s born to a really young, pretty mom. His dad is like, dead before he\u2019s born. His aunt comes over to adopt him, because the aunt thinks that he\u2019s going to be a girl. But soon as he\u2019s a boy, she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m out of here!\u201d The young mom, then, kind of befriends this man. He\u2019s nasty and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">sends David away to like, a boarding school type of scenario. Then I forget specifics. It\u2019s a big book. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">But yeah like, the lost opportunity, the aunt who wouldn\u2019t like, you know like, who was going to give him love and, you know, stability and money that backs off for no fault of his own. Then the evil step-dad, so that was really like... I saw, you know, recognized those in my life. (chuckles) It definitely <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">like, you know, it\u2019s like, you know, Freud wouldn\u2019t be very far off here (chuckles) and so he could say that I was maybe jealous of my dad, you know (chuckles), and perhaps felt replaced by him, so... Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Jealous of your dad when he came back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, yeah. But then, I think he pretty quickly took up that narrative before I could even articulate it, because, you know, I\u2019m a six-year-old child and he was a 36-year-old man or whatever. He was like, he was jealous. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m jealous of you guys and you guys are always teaming <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">up and bonding.\u201d (chuckles) I would secretly think, \u201cThat\u2019s right, you know. You can never have what I have with my Mom because, plainly, evidently, you just don\u2019t get her, you just don\u2019t love her. You\u2019re a fucking douche bag!\u201d (chuckles) You know, sad, but sad, yeah. I wasn\u2019t actually happy about that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A72\">you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562590\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like your mom mostly aligned with you or where did you feel her allegiances lay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s like the same way. I mean like, from my vantage point, from my perspective it was like, she was fair game or she could do whatever she wanted to like... I feel like... It was sad that she aligned with me... or needed to align with me, you know? I wonder if I thought it was sad. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB1\">know, this is complex. Yeah. (pause) Yeah, she mostly aligned with me, but it wasn\u2019t like... What does that mean? Like, took my side?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, it could mean a lot of things. You were describing your dad feeling that you and your mom were kind of like a unit (client affirms) and that he was jealous of that unit. (client affirms) So I was wondering, from your vantage point, did you feel that\u2019s what she was doing? Or <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">was she... yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: But it was like, circumstance. I mean, he wasn\u2019t there. He just, you know, came and left, and came and left. So, if he wanted to align with my mom, and if he wanted to be a unit with my mom, you know, he should have done something about it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: How did she feel about him coming back, when you were six? Do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: She was conflicted. I think she wanted to, she has a weird narrative. She was like, \u201cI wanted you to have a child , I wanted you to have a father, I didn\u2019t want my brother to take care of me, so I thought it was best to have a husband.\u201d (chuckles) Now that I\u2019m like, an adult and I have had <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">sex, I\u2019m like, I think there (chuckles) might be some other reasons as well, you know? Like, she might have been lonely, you know? Like... yeah. She has this martyr\u2019s narrative, just, you know. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Do you think she liked having him around?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: (sighs) I think there must have been, they must have had like some good times, you know. But I don\u2019t know if she actually... spends too much time thinking and regretting. I mean, I\u2019m sure she regretted it, when things were bad, when he beat me or like, when we were fighting, but... I think she <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">was just so busy and overwhelmed by like, jobs. He was a drunk and like, there would be something going on, like affairs and things. And like, they would get really, really... you know... (chuckles) complicated for her to deal with, so... (pause) I don\u2019t know why I brought this up! (chuckles) I forget <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B72\">why I\u2019m going in this direction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Well, you started by talking about wanting to retreat.
