That either what you actually said was a bit like it hurts too much to do it this way. And in a way that has happened before with scheduling. It\u2019s sort of, and unlike a lot of other things I think, it\u2019s kind of like this hurts too <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">much, I can\u2019t do it this way so here\u2019s the schedule change I\u2019m going to make. Okay, thanks, bye. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Well it happened in October and we didn\u2019t talk about it, the last, two years ago now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: 2012, yes, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I can think of. Can you think of another one? Oh and I want to see you more, it hurts too much to not have more sessions coming out of another session. Do you feel like that\u2019s the same thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s it might be. I guess -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: You don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Maybe the other one I had in mind was there may have been some of that when you stopped although it would\u2019ve been that\u2019s possibly acceptable. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: What? I didn\u2019t choose to stop. I didn\u2019t initiate the stop compared to the October thing that I initiated and what I\u2019m initiating now. [Pause] I initiated starting again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: You mean the stop was on me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes. Or it was on both of us in a way that doesn\u2019t involved there is no way that I would\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s no way that it would\u2019ve been possible in my mental frame, in my world view to continue seeing you until the pain. [inaudible at 00:04:27]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I may be wrong but I guess what I had in mind is unconsciously that may have nonetheless been similar. In other words it\u2019s different in that that October and just now you know and when you stopped you didn\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yes or even if I had known but I didn\u2019t know the point is I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to stop if the logistics were more at all in the realm of what I felt I could negotiate with then. There wasn\u2019t any space, there wasn\u2019t any concept for him or for me that it might make a difference to keep, to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">continue seeing you. And that was a very strong external influence at the time. So even if I had a sense of how it was hurting too much or something or it was making me really uncomfortable, I still would\u2019ve stopped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see. I [inaudible at 00:06:54] but I\u2019m not sure this is different. I think there\u2019s another strong external problem that is causing you to, I don\u2019t know quite where you\u2019re at in the decision but think about or stop coming in Monday morning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: No I\u2019m not feeling that firm about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re stopping or you\u2019re thinking about it because you don\u2019t want to be coming in then. I think you\u2019re thinking about it because [pause] either there are problems with our schedule or with your work or with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay let\u2019s recall that I asked for an additional time before this Monday thing came up. And I said if it happened to be too soon I already had a certain time I could end my schedule right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m having trouble telling if you are feeling like I\u2019m saying something that\u2019s kind of critical and you\u2019re feeling defensive, or if you\u2019re just telling me I\u2019m not getting the gist of why you\u2019re thinking about something on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I think both. Or neither. I think I am I\u2019m unsure of what you\u2019re doing here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes, so I\u2019m -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I can tell you I\u2019m not going to testify you (ph) why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: No, not yet. Yes, so I\u2019m getting a little disoriented about what disoriented and amused about your not letting this go by. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: By bringing up the beginning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes, I think it\u2019s good, I think it\u2019s really good. And I think you\u2019re right but I wanted to convey that by bringing up that I asked for another, an additional time. I wanted to convey or acknowledge that. There\u2019s something very painful about being apart. So I wanted it to change by asking to see you more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And then I wanted to change back when I had to cut back. I wanted to change back for the separation to have a different rhythm to it. There\u2019s really nothing else. It\u2019s about how painful it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">The thing about it just so happens that it\u2019s hard to do my Ph.D. when I\u2019m in pain. So if I have pretty much my whole week to do and this to do, it\u2019s making it really hard to juggle them both. I\u2019m not sure the answer is moving my Monday time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right, because this is related to sitting in a chair Monday, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes because pain\u2019s the thing. So do you want to tell me what you\u2019re doing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Sure. Well I have the idea that the way you\u2019re acting or thinking about acting on this, I wouldn\u2019t say I would always think this but in this case I do, probably indicates that there are things I don\u2019t know and maybe you don\u2019t know either, maybe not, about how it\u2019s painful. I\u2019m not saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">that I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s painful or that you haven\u2019t said so, but there\u2019s something about the feel of your to me it\u2019s sort of the way you\u2019re kind of gluing towards doing something about it but there\u2019s a little wariness of that October thing and maybe some other scheduling stuff and gives me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">impression. So my idea was to bring it up, let that kind of thing out, good-bye. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s a good idea bringing that up. This [inaudible at 00:15:10] is really good. Maybe because I started to tell you on Monday how I wanted to not have it be the way it is because it\u2019s too painful. I\u2019m shivering a lot and it\u2019s a strange response and it happens every so often, like every <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">few Thursdays but it happened last Thursday too. Do you know about shivering?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Do I know about shivering? I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re pretty anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes, do you know that shivering is the thing that humans do when they\u2019re anxious? It is really uncontrolofficele. I shivered like this when Jeremy had alcohol poisoning at my wedding right before [inaudible at 00:16:44]. I couldn\u2019t stop shivering for the entire night because watching him, making <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">sure he\u2019s keeping breathing and I\u2019m uncontrolofficely shivering. That\u2019s the only other time I remember other than here a lot of times. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">And it gets worse when you\u2019re talking or you\u2019re about to talk. [Pause] It\u2019s really strange because I don\u2019t feel upset but there\u2019s something very, very powerful happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yes my hunch is that you are something about the intimacy or how close I feel for having noticed this and brought it up and having how you\u2019re feeling about it or maybe you are in my mind or something. But <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I love you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Thank you. That\u2019s a lovely thing to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the only thing you hear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: A lovely thing to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a lovely thing to feel. And I stopped shivering. [Pause] That was amazing. It\u2019s gone for now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I held two people while they were crying yesterday. And with Danielle a few weeks ago that makes three. On Tuesday night Nelson and Peter did a post-op in my office. Got completely taken by surprise when his boyfriend broke up with him after a year and a day. And he lives, I don\u2019t know him that well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">he\u2019s just been around [inaudible at 00:23:35]. It\u2019s very intense. There\u2019s lots of feelings all the time. It\u2019s very multi-racial and he\u2019s very intense about it. [inaudible at 00:23:55] impact. Even if I just say I love you the whole time all the anxiety will dissipate. I think there is something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">that that is true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yes, I think you\u2019re right. [Pause] Maybe you\u2019re worried that I, that I love you is too much for me or that I want to look away from it as a passion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: So by keeping it in your face or keep it near you by saying it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Or that\u2019s what you\u2019re anxious about, is my reaction that way. [Laughs] I\u2019m laughing because in a way the problem\u2019s with me, that I don\u2019t want to know that or that I won\u2019t see it or will pretend it\u2019s not there or will focus on something else. Like, my thought about what you said about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">guy in the office is that there was some connection between the intensity and his boyfriend breaking up with him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: You mean sort of that this is one thing I don\u2019t like about drawing too much meaning from what I say after what I say after other stuff that I say, you know the context, because I could\u2019ve said the other person first and I didn\u2019t. And I could\u2019ve told this I think that this story would\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">come up no matter what other stuff came up today. [Therapist laughs] I do. I\u2019ve been talking about it all night yesterday like it was going to come up. You don\u2019t believe me? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Not that I don\u2019t believe you. It\u2019s that [pause] well I\u2019m not quite sure what it is. Okay, maybe what I\u2019m smiling about is that I had an idea about the way that what you said about it sort of [inaudible at 00:29:20] the other things we\u2019re talking about, most of it between you and me. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">guess there\u2019s something that\u2019s especially funny about sort of kind of not exactly like an argument against what I\u2019m saying on the basis on how I gather the evidence but it doesn\u2019t really address the central thing. Indefensible (ph), I was going to bring that up anyway. And then <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yes, the evidence was faulty or something like, it\u2019s what do they say in courts when the evidence -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Tampered with or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t obtained by rightful means so we\u2019re not going to consider it even though there\u2019s blood all over it. [Laughter] Yes, that\u2019s certainly how I feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And I guess I think it\u2019s funny I mean if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate or true, if that doesn\u2019t fit that\u2019s okay and you can say so. But that\u2019s not how you\u2019re going about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t have anything to take up about the content.

So I\u2019m sort of trying to set you straight like all right, well that\u2019s all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">Did you even say, something about the intensity at the beginning and his boyfriend breaking up with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yes, I think what I said was I imagine that those might be linked in your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: I think they were linked in his boyfriend\u2019s mind too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Okay, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really, really, cold.

And not only that but my methods are suspect. Which is fine, it\u2019s just an interesting time to decide that. [Laughing] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: No, I said one thing that I don\u2019t like about this method in general, oh you\u2019re saying the timing. I\u2019m trying to use the same method. I\u2019m just saying that the timing and my bringing up Nelson\u2019s boyfriend breaking up with him was just interesting, not the timing of my bringing it up. Your timing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">thing is bullshit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Okay. [Pause] I knew you weren\u2019t going to let the Monday thing go. I just thought that you would wait until you made the schedule change to talk about it. I thought you would let me have it and then talk about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: You mean that I\u2019d find another time, [inaudible at 00:37:03]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yes. I would never think you were going to say dude, I thought that had happened; I thought you would say no right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: No that I\u2019d talk another time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: No like what are you doing Allison? No like that. Like let\u2019s take a look at this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yes, well I\u2019ll just take the trash outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes, I talked to Jeremy about it. I was nervous about bringing it up [inaudible at 00:38:09] but I talked to him about it on Sunday. He said what\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s a reasonable reason to you. Oh I forgot about that reason. The reason, I don\u2019t know what reason I gave you but there is something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">showing up in the office first thing Monday morning that sets the week off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I think you said it was one of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Really different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: one of those things that you mentioned. You mentioned that and the yawning distance between Monday morning and Thursday afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: But yes, sort of I was thinking about how to talk to you about it and I ran it by Jeremy. [And in turn he said] (ph) yes, when you focus on what I wanted you to focus on. I mean who knows? Maybe you also want to focus on the other stuff. What I meant by that maybe I was nervous you wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">focus on helping me finish my Ph.D. And that you would ask me to take a look at what was happening here between you and me. And somehow, sometimes I was feeling mutually exclusive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t have the sense that it\u2019s felt that way as we talked about it today that I don\u2019t care about your Ph.D.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it has but that\u2019s what our intent is about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds like your whatever has sort of been the main of, not that I imagine you really care, but it would be if you\u2019re serious about this, Allison. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Which you kind of have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yes, by bringing it up the way you did. Or maybe it\u2019s more like you\u2019re saying I\u2019m serious about this Allison. Or I\u2019ve learned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I guess to me it seemed more like I was saying Allison I think you\u2019re upset. I hate what\u2019s going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yes, I guess I had become completely uninvolved. [Pause] I don\u2019t think you\u2019re saying just I think you\u2019re upset. Pretty fucking clear that I\u2019m upset. Not today only. I think you\u2019re saying I think you\u2019re upset and while there are many responses to that, one of which is doing the scheduling dance <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">which sometimes feels like I don\u2019t feel better, another response is to just talk about it now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">I think you are offering for me to have the choice of that response. Or you\u2019re sort of helping me see it as a choice slash you\u2019re showing the response that you prefer or that you think might be much helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Maybe I\u2019m saying you are attributing to me sort of evaluations of your responses. And I would say that I think I was trying to invite or welcome a way you\u2019re feeling upset that you seem to feel a little bit of [inaudible] or discomfort or shame about or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: I think in doing that you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re showing me what you value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Which is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: To look at the upset. Or to make space to look at it if I want to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m okay if you slightly amend that to convey that it\u2019s okay to look at, if that\u2019s what you want to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Okay but it takes two people to make a schedule change. So you\u2019re not saying if you would rather make a schedule change that\u2019s fine too. Both are okay. So far I haven\u2019t heard other stuff, maybe that kind of deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: No I mean to me this is if I could it just would\u2019ve felt very different if you said look I, we\u2019re at work, blah, blah, blah, more time, or you get through things more quickly, if the feel to me had been that rather than this sort of slightly furtive I\u2019m going to finesse something that feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">shitty a little bit with scheduling. Not that there are also legitimate reasons in terms of your work; I hear that and I believe it. I\u2019m not doubting you on that. But I guess that sort of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yes. I think there\u2019s always going to be this other thing when it comes to scheduling. There\u2019s not enough time for all of the time that I want. So it\u2019s unclear how to go about relating to that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I think part of what makes that typical and part of what I think could have gone earlier is that my responses to the scheduling stuff feel like personal responses to your wanting more time. And I think that and that if it feels like I\u2019m looking away from that aspect of the scheduling thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">it\u2019s kind of similar to in a way to saying yes I know, I just really f***ked up. I don\u2019t want to see how you feel. Which I think is really bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Okay so that was the sort of thing that you think you might not know or I might not know about how it feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I guess for me it clarifies some of that. It is to me that novel (ph) when you love someone and it seems like they don\u2019t really want to know or really see how that is part of your interactions or part of you wanting this or that. And it feels really shameful when that\u2019s the kind of response <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">you get. And it feels really like a relief and assuring when you know in other words they get it or are attentive to it. And it seems like that\u2019s what this experience can feel like a bit shaming about the scheduling stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: The scheduling is so fraught, so awkward. I\u2019m beginning to see it as a pretty critical part of the frame.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Did you say the word frame there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Link. Yes I can see this strange magical power. I mean I suppose if the dynamic were really different, if I were acting out in a way where I didn\u2019t show up to my sessions or I were halfway late every time or came at the wrong time, maybe that would seem like I have the magic power but that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">not the way it\u2019s playing out. Like I would fall asleep feeling like I have a magical power. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">I\u2019m afraid to say so what did you want to talk about today? [Pause] It\u2019s been clarifying to you, all the things? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I mean those things that seem to fit with what I was just saying, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:56:55] and then wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Well how those relate to the scheduling and what you\u2019re worried and upset about to do with the schedule? And I\u2019m not going to see how much it matters and why it matters and why it didn\u2019t cook (ph). And that\u2019s going to feel like me not really being a place to how you feel but I\u2019m me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">Which I think is important in part because you are very anxious but the intensity is what you feel will make me want to walk away from it or get away from it. [inaudible at 00:58:34] really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yes, I really felt it would bring out something misanthropic about you like I don\u2019t want to know about her, I can\u2019t bear to know about it, I can\u2019t reach. Maybe not as barely a personal not making space for me. But like I don\u2019t know, a place that can\u2019t be warmed, like a cold place that\u2019s there <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">for whatever reason that\u2019s how you were born. Maybe it\u2019s how you were born and this is why you\u2019re here. Or maybe you weren\u2019t born with it and you get it through training; one gets it through training. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">I think I\u2019m very afraid of that place. [Pause] If it I don\u2019t know. I wonder if I see it if it was my calling to warm people. And if I can\u2019t reach you and [inaudible at 01:01:36] in time for me to feel about it, what does that mean about you? And if I need to see that I\u2019m warming you and wanting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">believe it what does that mean about me? A person who\u2019s kind needs to warm people that\u2019s going to be shivering an awful lot maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Maybe you need to warm people in part to warm yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s what I called it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re shivering because of some other stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: You do? That\u2019s cool. It occurred to me that it used to be fainting. And I don\u2019t know if the shivering and the fainting are related. I think they\u2019re not really related but they\u2019re both kind of extreme fits of cold. I don\u2019t know, involuntary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">We don\u2019t talk much about fainting because it went away when I started seeing you. But it started dominating my life for 10 years. It\u2019s just gone. Sometimes I feel like this is a familiar fainting trigger and then I\u2019m just, I\u2019m aware of that and think that\u2019s not a thing anymore. And happiness may come <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">back I hope. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">It doesn\u2019t have yes whatever it was is completely gone right now. [Pause] I felt like I\u2019m like a grief attractant yesterday. Nelson was drawn to me and I was drawn to his grief and the whole office was sort of helping him and me. It was very tender how he shared the Ashley wants to talk news the night <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">that it happened, before it happened. When he said it he started just really freaking out at the end of the day that Ashley wants to talk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">Then we, the four of us, chatted about it. It was so tender and so close and he was so appreciative of us and we were just, didn\u2019t know anything. Didn\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know Nelson that well, we don\u2019t know Nelson and Ashley, we don\u2019t know Ashley at all. And somehow I, I don\u2019t know how the other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">felt, but I felt like I was right in there with him. I could feel what he was going through and I could talk about it with him. And somehow it was reassuring even though all of our guts told us that it was going to be benign. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">So I was thinking about him all evening and I e-mailed him said I hope it went okay. And he wrote back and said actually we broke up and I am in so much disbelief. And I felt so, so terrible. And any other time in my life I think I would\u2019ve had a completely different response, not like have being there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">in the first place or I  and then not knowing what to do with his pain or what to say. None of it happened that way. It was just oh, must commune with this person; must commune with this person\u2019s pain. So I wrote back right away, had confidence and a lot of calmness and a lot of just genuine sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD2\">of, yes confidence and the words I\u2019m so sorry, which I\u2019ve never felt genuine about saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">I don\u2019t know. I sort of indicated that none of us saw it coming and offered to bring him cake and bring him chocolate right now. Acknowledgement of those things don\u2019t, they probably don\u2019t do much to ease a heart shredded to pieces. And when I read the e-mail to Jeremy he said Allison that\u2019s so dramatic, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">those words are so dramatic. And I said I am so happy for the gay, intense, open men in my life, Nelson, at the moment. Nelson is totally going to get the words shredded to pieces. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">He did; he got them and he was so appreciative. And it\u2019s only going to get worse. He\u2019s, or at least in the next several days going to get worse. He\u2019s a total wreck but he came in yesterday. And he came in basically just to talk and there were a few of us who are close enough with him but I didn\u2019t think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">that I was very close with him. But then he comes to me and he\u2019s sobbing and sobbing and sobbing, this is after we had talked a few times during the day, and I just took him. No words, no hesitation, no nervousness. Just you go on; you\u2019re in my arms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">I kind of really feel like I felt it with Danielle and I felt it with Nelson when I feel somebody exhale when they\u2019re being held. I have. I have an exhale release button when somebody, when certain people touch it a certain way. Oh I didn\u2019t know I was holding onto that. And he\u2019s like tears, tears like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">snot, blubbering and he\u2019s just so, so overcome. And I had so much space for it. It\u2019s so surprising, too. And then half an hour later Joanne and I were taking an orange break <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m going to run to the restroom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Stretch and wait? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: [Down and dodge] (ph) break. Part of what has made this week so good is that I\u2019ve started to take five-minute body breaks every one to two hours. I feel like I have always had this, the awareness that that\u2019s important and thought that I was doing it but really wasn\u2019t. So I leave and go to a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D1\">different part of the building where I could be somewhat alone and not create a spectacle. I have a timer and spend five minutes doing something push-ups, yoga, running in place, jumping jacks or just sitting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">Do you like body breaks? They helped. I don\u2019t know why it helps to formalize it or structure it, have it be structure. But I feel like without those I\u2019m just always compulsively stretching or trying to adjust myself to the [inaudible at 01:16:59].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Scootching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yes. But these breaks are helping the rest of the time be less distracted and inviting. During our orange break Felicia (ph), this I don\u2019t know I think I told you about it, she\u2019s [inaudible at 01:17:30] in her 60s, she\u2019s an administrator in our department. She\u2019s not ordained but she\u2019s whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201131\">whatever a monk. She doesn\u2019t use that word. Anyway <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s more like a nun type or more like a minister type?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what her life is around. [inaudible at 01:18:12] right now. She is a meditator and she is a lesbian and she is very motherly. And I like her very much and I went to her and I said to her once. She walked by and she looked, she just looked awful. How are you Felicia (ph)? She said <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">good. I said your face shows that something really hard is happening. And she just sort of said, it\u2019s hard to go around at work and try to be normal so it took a couple seconds for her to feel how inviting I think Joanne and I were feeling about her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">She came and plopped down in a chair next to me. She said my friend died this morning. Or I guess first she said you guys are really the I\u2019m so lucky I\u2019ve run into you right now. My friend died this morning. And she couldn\u2019t really say it she was so upset, so sad. And it was the same thing that had <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">just happened with Nelson. She\u2019s crying and so sad, so in pain and just looks at me. And I took her in again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">I had no thinking, wondering; I was just there. A hug but it was really, really intense holding and again an exhale. [Pause] When she told us about it [at the end of lunch] (ph) and thanked us I e-mailed her last night saying you\u2019re not; I\u2019m sending my love. Yes Nelson can still take a shift. But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">think I\u2019m not contained. I don\u2019t know how to contain it. It\u2019s more like being there made such a big impression on me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">I had the most stressful dream that I\u2019ve had in a long time last night. I was in some house and there were a lot of people and we were partying and it was on a boat or something, or a ship. I think I was in the house and I was running to my room. And before I could shut the door these two female nuns <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">or monks or, I don\u2019t know, mystical women who were short and in matching blue sequined clothing came in and [inaudible at 01:22:51] to the bed and the desk. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2011C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">I was running to the desk chair and they came in and they took their place on the bed. And then our family\u2019s oldest friend in Virginia, Elena (ph), she used to have a husband Elijah (ph) and they have two kids, Jayden (ph) and Colton (ph). Elijah (ph) died two and a half years ago basically from terrible, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F1\">terribly managed diabetes. He was very, very, very depressed for many years and had chronic fatigue syndrome their whole family was falling apart even before he died. But Elena is now a widow; she\u2019s very sad. In her own life she\u2019s always been very sad, very fearful. She\u2019s my mom\u2019s, one of my mom\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F2\">good friend and my dad and my grandfather. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">So she comes in crying into the door and so it\u2019s all of us in this tiny little room. And she closes the door and she tries to lock it. Suddenly I realized that all of these people are here to rape me. And so I lurch at the door, this very familiar door I don\u2019t know what door it is. I think it\u2019s in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201211\">my house in Virginia. And all of these people are small so I realize I have and the door is oily, it\u2019s really slippery and I\u2019m struggling with her to not lock the door. And then I basically let out all the anger and rage and evil that\u2019s probably in the entire room at Elena. You dirty, fucking bitch, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201212\">I don\u2019t know what I said but I said something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">And she said, she has tears streaming down her face, she said I made a terrible mistake. It was two women who were there to molest me raped me, not her. It wasn\u2019t clear why she was there and she was locking the door. She had these wide, scared eyes and was pleading with me as if I was going to kill <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201231\">her or something. Took a long time to recover from the dream because I felt so remorseful about how I treated her. That was so scary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">I can\u2019t think of much today to associate with the dream except that I got really obsessed with Annabelle and Gabriella (ph) since [inaudible at 01:27:20]. And I was thinking of Violet (ph) and [inaudible at 01:27:31] were abused sexually as a child and somehow I just felt mystified and I was thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201271\">about that yesterday. Annabelle [and I] (ph) had been molested by her father and some coach. I won\u2019t talk about her but those were two things that come to mind about the dream. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">THERAPIST: [We have] (ph) five minutes <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">CLIENT: Can you unconsciously tell me that because it\u2019s so disruptive? Isn\u2019t it kind of disruptive? Even now I\u2019d appreciate it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t really know what to say about the dream. The part about it taking place in your room on the ship away from the party kind of makes sense to me in that what happens there is about the sort of stuff that, like grief and anger, like little pieces of that are sort of compartmentalized <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201311\">off from you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">And then my other association is to your saying that it\u2019s disruptive when I say that it\u2019s five minutes. I imagine it feels intrusive and disturbing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">CLIENT: It did that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yes? And the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: Like also when you went to the bathroom and also when you took the trash out. It was oh, okay, there\u2019s other stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20138-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20138-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562284\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">THERAPIST: That made me think of the abuse in the dream. And it also occurred to me that probably why it felt so disruptive is that it felt like that means we have to stop soon. In other words not saying it per se but what it points to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yes, all the disruptive reaction. Just the trash and the bathroom and the five minutes. They all, yes, I guess all of them are about we have to stop now [inaudible at 01:33:57] even if it\u2019s for a minute. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yes. I guess there\u2019s something that feel a little I think probably like the piece that you\u2019re afraid of and [inaudible at 01:34:12] in a dream. So I mean I don\u2019t know what more to think of it but those the initial thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 01:34:35].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">THERAPIST: We should stop. [Pause] Oh and I should have asked this before but so Monday it looks like you will be here right, in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">THERAPIST: Okay. I think in your e-mail it says weather permitting or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s really how I interpret this weather after I [inaudible at 01:35:51]. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">THERAPIST: All right. I\u2019ll talk to you Monday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
