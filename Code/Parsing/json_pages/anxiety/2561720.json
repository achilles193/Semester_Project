That\u2019s a little crazy but I\u2019m going to go to Delaware. I don\u2019t know. Fuck it. It\u2019s an adventure. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m unemployed. I don\u2019t know. I have a car. Who cares? So, yeah, it\u2019s a little nutty, right? Yeah, it\u2019s a little nutty, but I thought, you know, if I overthink <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">it then clearly I wouldn\u2019t go, you know. And at this point, why the fuck not? It\u2019s not like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You can afford to (inaudible at 1:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Uh, I mean, can I? I mean I can\u2019t really afford to do anything right now. That\u2019s the other thing I couldn\u2019t overthink. Well, I did torture myself til like 4 o\u2019clock yesterday. But, then I was like, \u201cYou know what? I would feel so shitty if I missed out on meeting someone really amazing because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I couldn\u2019t afford $250.\u201d I mean, I\u2019d rather just be kind of stressed for that week or whatever and be scrambling, but at least say that, well, I mean, I didn\u2019t pass on an opportunity because of two nights in a motel or a hotel that I \u2013 So, no I can\u2019t afford it, but I can, kind of. (pause) I just have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">to not really go out or do anything around here for a while, for the whatever days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">(Sigh) Who the fuck knows? I don\u2019t know, but, yeah, so \u2013 (pause) Because the other thing is, even if nothing comes of it, I have been thinking more about this that I kind of am like my mom\u2019s side in this way. On the one hand, I take extreme chances like moving to fucking London or whatever but I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">take everyday chances. You know? So in one way I\u2019m not like them at all, but then, really on a day-to-day level, I am like them. When I was in London, did I really do \u2013 You know what I mean? When I was in London, I just totally came up with a routine. I didn\u2019t like to explore really that much. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">not that I didn\u2019t go out but I did what I do here. I found my couple bars that I went to once in a while and even when I was there, I didn\u2019t really approach people, I didn\u2019t I mean over there it was easier because people just approach you, but \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">So I feel like, if nothing else, really what\u2019s \u2013 To drive to Delaware \u2013 I mean it\u2019s not You know what I mean? But it is a little wacky to meet someone you\u2019ve never met before and be kind of excited about that. Whatever, you know. Hopefully, that works out. If it doesn\u2019t, whatever, but I\u2019ve been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">thinking more about that, that I have \u2013 And I feel like I was a little better with that before, you know? When I first started at Brown, I think (pause) that first semester I went to a bunch of events at Brown. I would go to like this department is having this opening or lecture. You know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">And I met people, you know. I dated a chick for a while that I had met at the Center. Like, I don\u2019t do that anymore. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">So, I\u2019ve been thinking about that. Or even, I don\u2019t know, like I just have friends that\u2019ll be like, \u201cWhat\u2019d you do this weekend?\u201d \u201cOh, I, um, (pause) I went to Troutmoor.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561720\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you just went away for the weekend or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I went away for the weekend. Or I went to Troutmoor and you know it\u2019s really nice in the summer; you can just hike up there and \u2013 you know. Whereas me, I\u2019ll just drive on Rt. 2, [because I like] (ph) driving, but I won\u2019t really get out anywhere. You know what I mean? So when I really thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">about it, I mean obviously I can\u2019t afford it but then I was like, \u201cYeah, but, honestly, it\u2019s just a drive to Delaware. I mean I\u2019ve got, you know\u2014\u201d I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t go to San Diego \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Besides the money, it\u2019s like, it doesn\u2019t actually it\u2019s kind of ordinary to take a trip. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say, yeah. For example, I don\u2019t go to San Diego. I have friends down there. I\u2019m unemployed! Or even when I wasn\u2019t unemployed \u2013 it\u2019s San Diego. You can just go I was working from home. You know what I mean? What is that? I just don\u2019t. I just don\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: What is that when you say that?

I worry that you know \u2013 I don\u2019t want to take the bus so I want to drive. That\u2019s fine but then \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s San Diego. I just worry that going down there, even if I stay at a friend\u2019s house, that, you know, I\u2019m going to spend <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">money. It\u2019s hard to be there and not spend. But, you could argue that\u2019s still a bit of an excuse because really I\u2019m going to spend what I would spend here. We\u2019re going to go drinking, basically, and eat pizza I guess. We\u2019re not going to go to a five-star restaurant, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: So there\u2019s something more than that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the parking \u2013 they don\u2019t live in Manhattan. So in Brooklyn I can find on the street or whatever. So, really what is it? You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: So what is it? It\u2019s a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. My mom\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re very (pause) They\u2019re stuck in their ways a little bit. They\u2019re very \u2013 They\u2019re not adventurous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Creatures of habit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Creatures of habit and not adventurous at all. And a little bit like \u2013 And even more they\u2019re a little bit like \u201cDarien, driving, traffic\u201d. Like they find things about everything. Flying, they\u2019re scared of that. Or it\u2019s too expensive. They find excuses to not do things. That was a big thing the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">last time \u2013 I was like, \u201cWhat a second. Are you kidding me?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">Yeah, of course I can\u2019t afford it, but I can\u2019t afford this. I mean, I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s a lot of things I can\u2019t afford. It\u2019s about deciding something \u2013 Even if it doesn\u2019t work out with this chick, yeah, that\u2019ll be a bummer but you know what, it\u2019d be kind of just a fun \u2013 I like driving and just to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">get away for \u2013 I mean it\u2019s not really rocket science, you know. I just don\u2019t, well, do that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">Or, yeah, you can like you said, for example, I could \u2013 working from home or even for a weekend \u2013 why is a big deal to just let\u2019s say drive to, I don\u2019t know, Lowry and get like a $50 or $60 hotel room. You know, not have to be in the city. There are lots of beautiful, amazing, little, cool \u2013 Quebec. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I don\u2019t know. And just be like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m just going to go for the day, hang out there and take my laptop. I can just hang out and just to get away, you know.\u201d I don\u2019t do any of that shit.

If there\u2019s some comfort about feeling at least connected to Darien. There\u2019s at least some company\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Oh, big time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, big time. Familiar faces at the bar (sp) and this and that \u2013 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s comforting, of course, and I\u2019ve been very honest about that. Now I\u2019m realizing that has to be balanced out. I think that is great. That\u2019s a real blessing I think. But, on the contrary, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">it should give me more impetus to be like, \u201cHow awesome! I have this amazing home base.\u201d So, I\u2019m going to go to Montreal for two days and just hang out in Montreal. It\u2019s what? Like a 5 \u00bd hour drive. So, yeah (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">I\u2019m very extreme that way. I want to go back to Iceland. You know, these big things. And I guess I do do those things every so often, but I\u2019m really missing out on changing my mood and just expanding, you know But, yeah, you\u2019re right. There is something \u2013 It makes me nervous and it makes me It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">just out of your comfort zone, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Even going to like a \u2013 You know I love art, you know. There are art openings all the fucking time. Wine, hang out (inaudible at 00:09:39) Why don\u2019t I go to those? It\u2019s odd. You know what I mean? It\u2019s right down the street (laughing). Just go. Who gives a shit? Have some wine, look at some pretty girls, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">hopefully some good art. You know, just change your environment. I don\u2019t do that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I know this might sound a little crazy but it\u2019s reminding me of thinking about you as a boy falling asleep at night. Remember you told me about the fears and going to bed and your mom or even one of your aunts would come and sit with you? That period of sleep between being up with comfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">people and going to sleep and being [all lonely] (ph), how alone kids can feel and I think you felt to an extreme degree when you\u2019re alone with your own thoughts in your mind and it\u2019s dark and there\u2019s [Nosferatu appearing] (ph). There\u2019s a lot of anxiety in that transition from awake with people to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">quiet recesses, existential dread of the darkness that feels like the comforts of home versus even to go to Assyria, to go to England \u2013 It\u2019s almost like the other extreme about going somewhere and being totally alone and embracing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">But these transitional spaces where you\u2019re somewhat close but you\u2019re drifting off somewhat, I mean, this is where the anxiety was as a kid where it got loud for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve really been thinking about \u2013 It\u2019s such a deep, complicated thing to \u2013 The more and more you realize how affected you\u2019ve been by your upbringing? It\u2019s just like (noise). You know? You start seeing it in all facets of your decision-making.

And even something like even asking a friend to help me out with my business \u2013 When I really think about it, that\u2019s \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">The fact that I won\u2019t do that is \u2013 That\u2019s kind of them too. Like I\u2019m doing myself a disservice. You know what I mean? Because somehow it\u2019s like groveling or somehow it\u2019s completely unacceptable to ask. You know what I mean? Meanwhile, that\u2019s exactly what people do, unless people just have money. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">what a lot of small business people do. They have to \u2013 family, friends They\u2019re not asking money to buy a stereo system for Christ\u2019s sake. But I can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m so mortified by that thought.

It\u2019s pathetic. It\u2019s $1000. You have to ask someone for $1000. Yeah, just all that. The person is going to think of you differently now. Whether they give you the money or not, they\u2019re going to be like (makes a noise), you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">know. So, somehow it\u2019s going to taint something.

He\u2019s like, \u201cPay me back when you can.\u201d So, I just kind of let it slip to my mom and she was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">(pause).

And somehow, everyone else doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s as if everyone has money except <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">her. Do you know what I mean? She doesn\u2019t think that \u2013 most people don\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at your couple of Assyrian friends and their dentist sons or whatever (laughing). Most people \u2013 We\u2019re actually better off than most people. She doesn\u2019t even get that. She definitely doesn\u2019t get that.

She never\u2014She really \u2013 Wow, I just \u2013 Boom. That\u2019s crazy. Epiphany. My mom is kind of like me with my book and my music. You have a three-family house. She doesn\u2019t understand. She says she does but she doesn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t get that \u2013 what a position she\u2019s in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">In her mind, \u201cBig deal\u201d. Her friends have single-family \u2013 nice big single-family homes and little nice neighborhoods. Everything is, \u201cI can\u2019t invite people over for dinner here.\u201d It\u2019s just, you know. What the fuck are you saying? What are you talking about? Her unit is like immaculate, beautiful, little, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">you know.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">Even when I was telling my uncle about the life-coaching, she kept chiming in. \u201cWell, yeah, it\u2019s kind of like with psychologists, right?\u201d I was like, \u201cCalm down.\u201d First of all, it\u2019s not anything like psychologists and secondly, I could tell what she was trying to do. She was trying to \u2013 She\u2019s insecure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">She\u2019s trying to make it sound \u2013 Well, no, it\u2019s real. She\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s a real business and it\u2019s important. Calm the fuck down. I\u2019m not trying to prove anything to anybody. I\u2019m fine.

Well, it\u2019s especially to herself. All these things really are about her. She thinks they\u2019re about what other people think. Other people don\u2019t think shit. It\u2019s really just her torturing herself. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s also so complicated and difficult when that voice also smacks up against the ways you have felt stuck since your father died, for a long time. Like there is some piece of that that you\u2019re coming into the real sense of lost time, like wishing you had found life-coaching when you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">were 25. There is something real about that that makes you sad and yet, it is so different than your mother\u2019s constant critical voice since you were a child even before this trauma happened. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Not really, but I think maybe what you\u2019re saying \u2013 I don\u2019t know. For me, I\u2019m just sad. I\u2019m just mourning something that\u2019s real, like you said, and that\u2019s very healthy. You know what I mean? I was trying to run away from that or I was trying to ignore it or I was \u2013 It\u2019s just a bummer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">But I take comfort in the fact that, first of all, I\u2019m still young and, second of all, I\u2019ve worked my ass off. Third of all, even though I\u2019m mourning the past but in that past, I did a lot of shit. I just don\u2019t quite \u2013 I see it now, but it\u2019s still taking some time. But I wasn\u2019t as miserable maybe as <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">I think I was also and, again, that\u2019s them. Everything is way more miserable than really it is.

I might have been a little \u2013 I don\u2019t know about whining, but I was definitely maybe dwelling or wallowing in just a darker place, you know Spinning my wheels more. Whereas with her, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">that is what it is. Do you see what I\u2019m saying? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: If she just \u2013 If she was just honest and said, \u201cYou know I\u2019m really, really sad.

Period. Squandered opportunities and now here I am and I can\u2019t get those things back and it\u2019s just a real bummer. That\u2019s very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: So, I think that\u2019s the difference now. I\u2019m finally in a place where, clearly, a lot of things are her fault (laughing) and this or that, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel the way it used to. Now I feel very like I own my life. You know what I mean? I feel motivated; I feel optimistic; I feel, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">Things that I was feeling in the past but that just kept \u2013 because if I wasn\u2019t feeling those things, there\u2019s no way I could have written and published a book. You know, now I see that the things I did accomplish, if I was so miserable \u2013 You can\u2019t accomplish those things. You can write those songs, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">actually releasing a record is a very different thing. Actually getting a book deal \u2013 You know what I mean?

Now it\u2019s much more \u2013 you know. (pause) Whereas my family is not good at just owning up. They don\u2019t own up to things. Everything is someone else\u2019s fault or the world\u2019s fault or it\u2019s just the way it is. You know what I mean? Might makes right or whatever.

(long pause) And again, I think that comes from their dad. You know my grandpa was a very \u201cme against the world\u201d kind of guy. It\u2019s understandable. All his siblings died; he was the only child left. Hard life, so \u2013 That\u2019s how you And politically charged and all this shit \u2013 And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">my grandmother, in a different way, not politically charged, but a fucking orphan.

Like, be an engineer and play your little ukulele on <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">the weekends. That was the message. Instead of, see, that\u2019s the thing. Now that I think more \u2013 All they had to say \u2013 Like if they tweaked even that message a little bit, I would\u2019ve been on board.

If they just totally \u2013 If they had that more American \u2013 I think that\u2019s a very Western\/American \u2013 because that\u2019s a luxury way of thinking.

That\u2019s really all that it\u2019s \u2013 For them, it\u2019s like, they don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B32\">a carpet-cleaner. \u201cLike, wow, he\u2019s got this amazing carpet cleaning busy. He makes great money.\u201d That\u2019s all they care about. To them, success is not whether you\u2019re a professor at Princeton or you\u2019re the best plumber in Darien.

Yeah, the professor, yeah, that\u2019s classy and all that, but really it\u2019s about the cashish (sp). That\u2019s what they care about. So, that\u2019s what was \u2013 It was so cookie-cutter. Even at a young age it was like \u2013 There were just three things I could be \u2013 a doctor, engineer, lawyer. You\u2019re just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">asking for your kid to rebel. You\u2019re basically just saying there are only three professions in the world that you can do and everything else is really superfluous.

Maybe I can stay at the Motel 8.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, look at this fucking shithole.\u201d I was tortured. \u201cWho do I think I am?\u201d and, you know \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Do you mean to stay at the Wyndham?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. \u201c$87. Wow, that\u2019s like 100. With taxes it\u2019s like 170. Whatever. Fuck! Then I\u2019m feeling stupid because that\u2019s so nothing. I\u2019m like, \u201cJesus Christ, I\u2019m worried over like 100.\u201d You know what I mean? It\u2019s such \u2013 This is what it is right now. It\u2019s okay. Other people are broke. They pretend <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">that they\u2019re not because they two credit cards that they \u2013 They\u2019re just as broke as I am. They\u2019re just fucking charging everything. I mean like, so what. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s so much feeling about money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah, big time. That\u2019s why at one point I was feeling like, \u201cWhat the fuck am I doing?\u201d One way or the other it\u2019s going to be fine. What am I going to be sleeping on the side of the road or I\u2019m suddenly going to be homeless? What is this that I\u2019m so obsessing over? I was obsessing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF1\">You know and this like \u2013 Come on, man. Just click.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Do you know what it was, though? When you say obsessing\u2014Is it like beating yourself up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s just like feeling \u2013 Like just what I\u2019m saying. Like I just felt like a loser. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I just felt like How embarrassing that this is where I\u2019m at. You know what I mean? And then that leads a little bit into that feeling of, \u201cWhat am I doing anyway driving to Delaware?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D31\">You know what I mean? What if this doesn\u2019t even work? What the fuck am I doing? I\u2019m like going to meet a stranger. Instead of a more healthy, \u201cThis is kind of funny. It\u2019s an adventure. Yeah, I\u2019m going to meet a stranger but I\u2019ve talked to her a lot. She seems like a really good person and either way <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D32\">it\u2019s just\u201d \u2013 I don\u2019t do these things. So, you know what? I\u2019m going to do it. Something in me is just \u2013 I\u2019ve got to trust myself instead of like constantly being tortured by things that have nothing to do with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561720\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">But, yeah.

The criticism inside, the obsession about money and about hand-wringing all the time it\u2019s like that it makes it almost impossible to find thinking about money in a kind of practically, healthy way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">CLIENT: which I\u2019m finally doing. Yeah. That\u2019s finally what feels so good. I\u2019m like, \u201cWait a minute. I have all \u2013 What idiot doesn\u2019t want money?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an ordinary need in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: What idiot doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s an amazing tool? No fucking shit. I\u2019d love to have a lot. It\u2019s always for me just been about, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a hamster.\u201d That was the only thing. I\u2019m different than that. Somehow, I always knew that I was. So I was always Look, there are millions of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD1\">ways to make money. It doesn\u2019t have to be three very cookie-cutter professions that are trying to be forced on me, while also negating the two biggest parts of my life. (laughing) You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">That was all that is was, which I think, again, other, very Westernized and middle-class, just Westernized, that understand how to navigate the system and culture \u2013 There\u2019d be a difference. They\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, ok. Well, this kid obviously has a lot of \u2013 We may not get it.\u201d But a lot of people say that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">about their kids. Like, yeah, it\u2019s crazy; he\u2019s just somehow really into chess. It\u2019s fucking crazy. I fucking hate chess. Whatever. But they know how to push their kids and be like, \u201cHe went to chess camp. And he\u2014\u201d You know. There are millions of ways to make money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And no space for that part of you to flourish and then to think about practicality about how to make that work for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah! how to make a life where I can breathe, not hate what I do 9-5, whatever, and have my art. It\u2019s really not even that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: It didn\u2019t have to be that hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It really didn\u2019t. \u201cWell, how about opening a grocery store?\u201d What the fuck are you talking about? You open a grocery store. It\u2019s like all these nonsense kinds of things that really is about them. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who really wanted to be a lawyer or something.\u201d Well, you came <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E71\">here at a young age. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. People come here in their fucking 40s and they go to law school. They learn the language and they go to law school. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. (laughing) So \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">That\u2019s why now it feels so good. Now I am thinking about money in a way that works for me. Of course I want money. I\u2019m not an idiot. And I know that I can make money; it just took time to just get to a place where I can make it without hating how I\u2019m making it. You know what I mean? Hating my boss or <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E91\">feeling like, \u201cWhat the fuck? I have to work from four to midnight and come home and try to fucking write a novel.

My mom has this whole thing about waking up really early and (makes a noise). All this shit. That doesn\u2019t \u2013 Not only doesn\u2019t work, I just read a great article in The Guardian about how there\u2019s all this now scientific evidence \u2013 not evidence, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB1\">studies that prove that actually night owl, through the span of their lives, night owls are more innovative and end up making more money. Yeah. Which whatever. To me, like, I just don\u2019t care.

So, on top of everything else to be made to feel like you\u2019re kind of just such an outcast. You\u2019re so weird. Or so lazy. Like you don\u2019t have a work ethic or something. You know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">So and so\u2019s daughter, she did her masters while she was also working in the pharmacy at CVS. That\u2019s great!
