So someone was going to be there who\u2019s a patient?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Whoa, is that, does that happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It does happen, and I mean people \u2013 I see people in the field, that happens in this field, people are seen, everybody has their own characters -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Oh, oh, oh, right, right, right, that\u2019s right. Wow. That\u2019s interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But if it\u2019s a large setting, it\u2019s not as problematic. If it\u2019s a small setting, it can be complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: If there\u2019s going to be some kind of, yeah. Like, I can see that being weird, yeah. Speaking of which, let\u2019s talk some shop here. So, I have a few questions. The LMHC and the LMFT. Does it matter? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know the LMFT at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Family, whatever, therapists? Okay. Because this woman, who, I really like what she does at UConn, she\u2019s in the LMFT, or I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s in the MS \u2013 they have three MS\u2019s: Family and Marriage Therapy, Mental Health Counseling, and Rehabilitation Counseling. I\u2019m not going to do Rehabilitation <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">\u2013 you know, I don\u2019t want to go to a hospital and deal with a cokehead or whatever. But the other two, they seem\u2026 I mean, you can see people, you can see couples if you \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what the difference is there. The other thing is, so there\u2019s a difference in pay, right? In terms of insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Pay grade. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Because obviously psychologists will get paid more of a percentage or whatever it is than \u2013 like, social workers will get a different okay. Because that\u2019s kind of important. I mean, if I\u2019m going to do all this, if I\u2019m going to get somehow gypped, or it\u2019s not really, you know what I mean? I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">just trying to figure out what that means, exactly. Like, I\u2019m trying to figure out, okay, so what would I get. If I charged this per hour, and someone has insurance, what does that mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve got to figure that out, yeah. I didn\u2019t think about that. But. Anyway, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I think the pay \u2013 insurance companies end up paying, in a way, commensurate with the years you\u2019ve been training. So that\u2019s like, a medical \u2013 someone who has an MD gets slightly more than a PhD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Your schooling, you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see. I see. That\u2019s just weird, though, then, because that means, what if the market is something, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re charging per hour? So they\u2019re not going to pay you what you\u2019re <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Uh uh. Not if you\u2019re a contracted provider. You agree to the rate that they set.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: You agree. Okay. Or you charge privately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Or you charge privately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: So you can do both. I see. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Or if they have a PPO plan, you can balance bill. But if you\u2019re part of the HMO, you have to agree to whatever their rate is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Right. Okay. So that\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to ask around about or whatever. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Sounds like just a lot of research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s just good to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561746\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: It is good to know. It\u2019s like making -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I mean, because this is \u2013 I mean I am interested in all this, obviously, but would I be going to a program? No. I mean it\u2019s just for business, you know what I mean? Luckily it\u2019s something I\u2019m really interested in, but I would never do this if it wasn\u2019t \u2013 you know what I mean? I have no desire <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">to go back to graduate school. So, you know, it\u2019s got to be worth it. I mean I probably have to take out loans again, you know. So it\u2019s really got to be worth doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And you definitely don\u2019t want to go into it thinking it\u2019s one thing and then figuring out in some way it\u2019s not what you thought it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a big commitment. Financially, time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It seems like it would be well worth doing, but yeah, it\u2019s just good to know those nuts and bolts kinds of things. Do you just call the insurance company and ask them these kinds of things? Because online, there wasn\u2019t really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s hard to find. It\u2019s not online. It\u2019s not online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Right? Because I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t just they don\u2019t just post that online. Okay. So maybe I just need to call them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Sometimes they don\u2019t even tell you, even if you have a \u2013 I could call right now, if someone were to have insurance with them and say \u201cWhat\u2019s the rate you want?\u201d and they\u2019ll say \u201cWe won\u2019t, we can\u2019t tell you until you submit a bill and you get a reimbursement for it\u201d. That\u2019s how you find out. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">Sometimes they do, sometimes they don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: So basically you have to ask other people in your boat what they\u2019re getting, kind of. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Jesus Christ. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: This is where your having \u2013 I mean, just having other people in the community that you could network with, this is the kind of stuff people have a peer supervision group, and what are you guys doing about this, and what are you getting for this, it all comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah yeah yeah. And I think that\u2019s one of the first things that I\u2019ll probably do. If I can figure out the financial stuff. Maybe get a mentor coach? Just like you have, you know, someone. Because I have reached out to coaches, but a lot of them are \u2013 some of them are younger than me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">they\u2019re not \u2013 they seem like we\u2019re just basically the same. There\u2019s nothing \u2013 I don\u2019t see any major, you know. So that\u2019s good too. You need that, you know? And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s things they know that I don\u2019t know. But yeah, I feel like someone who\u2019s really seasoned\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Well you might have to pay, but it might be worth having a consultation to get all these questions down and go in and \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: No, no, it\u2019s totally worth doing all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">[pause from 00:06:12 to 00:06:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">I remembered some of my dreams. There was a scary one with a dude, I was driving, and some dude started, like, shooting at cars, trying to kill people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: This is one from a few nights ago that you\u2019re referring to, or last night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Not last night. I\u2019d had some last night too, but of course -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Sometime in the last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: In the last week. There was one; yeah, they keep kind of popping back into my mind. That\u2019s the main thing I remember. I thought there was something else, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561746\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Was it someone in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: No, I think I was really upset about this fucking shit in Africa? That they go into the schools and like, kill these students in their sleep, and stuff. So I think it was that, but also I think it\u2019s, you know, you\u2019re trying to get somewhere and someone\u2019s trying to stop you. Pretty symbolic. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">I got away; I almost saw it happening, I almost \u2013 in the dream, it was almost like, just as he was about to do it, I kind of knew something. So I literally just drove in the other direction. Didn\u2019t even see much of what happened or anything like that. So that was interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: You weren\u2019t frozen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Oh, no. I got the hell out of there, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s interesting, I wasn\u2019t frozen, yeah. I didn\u2019t think about that. [Pause from 00:07:58 to 00:08:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: With the defaulting thing, it\u2019s like a danger. All of a sudden the old stuff comes haunting back. Is it the old, do you figure it out and take care of it? In the dream you\u2019re getting out of there. Keeping yourself safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">[Pause from 00:08:42 to 00:08:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Not sure. Yeah, I mean I was thinking \u2013 I was just thinking about that, I was thinking about, like, also about the relationship thing, that\u2019s become such a\u2026 it\u2019s really on my mind now. Because maybe that\u2019s related too, you know? It\u2019s the kind of time when I have to be careful to not \u2013 you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">just got to be careful, you know what I mean? You\u2019ve got to just make sure you\u2019re taking care of your \u2013 to not make any rash decisions, or to not go to either extreme, of making it more of a big deal than it really is, or meeting someone and just kind of \u2013 you know what I mean? I don\u2019t do that much anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Meeting someone and just kind of, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure, exactly. I\u2019m just saying, like, that it\u2019s just so much on my mind, I feel like I need to just be aware of that, and not \u2013 just be aware of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And when you say what\u2019s on your mind about it? Being sad about it, longing for a relationship, the past?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: All of it. Yeah. Going over stuff in the past, being sad about it, wanting somebody, wondering why the fuck this is so difficult, all of it. Stopping myself from reaching out to people\u2026 like, I\u2019m just on the cusp of, you know, I\u2019m just going to write Kelly an e-mail. Very quick, like, I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">to be like, you don\u2019t even have to respond, don\u2019t worry about it. I just want to apologize for how things went down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: For what? When you\u2019re thinking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Because I feel like again, I don\u2019t know, was I really thinking? I don\u2019t know. Yeah, she has a kid. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not confident with my decision-making prowess when it comes to this shit. It\u2019s the one thing I don\u2019t \u2013 because everything else is pretty much fixed, right? I know very clearly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">yep, I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Brown, and that would never happen again. Or I\u2019m really good about saying \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d That\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t wrap my head around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s hard to trust, in a way, did you not follow that out further for good reasons, or were they defensive reasons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Like was I just being an asshole, and you know, she\u2019s a little bit \u2013 not as thin as I wanted, and even though I wasn\u2019t going there, subconsciously was I going there? Or, even the kid. Yeah, that is an issue.

Let\u2019s just keep going, and just see what happens.\u201d Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s not that those things weren\u2019t issues, I was right, that those things are issues. And there were things about her \u2013 she\u2019s not perfect, there were things, even in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200952\">her personality, I think I was saying in here. But I don\u2019t know. I just feel like my track record isn\u2019t good. Well, there\u2019s something with everybody. I seem to find stuff with everybody, right, and I can rationalize a lot of it. \u201cWell, Meredith was like this.\u201d Well, a lot of that is true, I\u2019m just saying -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561746\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: What if you\u2019re going to find something wrong with everyone, maybe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: That and also just not sticking it out. You\u2019ve got to commit to these things, kind of, even when it\u2019s shitty sometimes, right? I never do. Either there\u2019s a kid, or she\u2019s kind of nuts or whatever, which all is true, but, I mean who\u2026 you know what I mean? No? I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, I hear you.

Like with Meredith, what the fuck? I just left. I fucking left, you know. And I left her there. That\u2019s kind of \u2013 you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Where did you go? When you say you left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I mean I came back here. And she stayed in London.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: In London.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Like, what was going on there? As bad as things might have been in my mind, that\u2019s the girl that moved for me, to fucking Scotland. That\u2019s a bit of an extreme example, but it\u2019s pretty symbolic. Even Michelle, yeah, she was manic and wacky, whatever. But, I don\u2019t know. Did I really try to sit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">down with her and talk these things out? Nope. And even with Kelly, we really didn\u2019t talk that much in person about these things, you know what I mean? So I just worry that there\u2019s something in me \u2013 I have that thing where it just shuts down, and once it shuts down \u2013 remember I was saying when she took <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A72\">me away from my birthday? I couldn\u2019t even have sex with her. What is that? That worries me a little bit. Like, to be so hot and cold. I remember thinking \u201cOh, this is over. I\u2019ve already decided. I just want to get back home.\u201d Once I go to that place, there\u2019s no room for, like, \u201cWait a minute, we\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A73\">invested a lot of emotion here, this is a really good person.\u201d You know what I mean? There\u2019s no \u2013 that worries me a little bit. Like, what the fuck. Like, who leaves a 24, 25-year-old girl, who\u2019s moved around the world to be with you, who wants to marry you? Yeah, yeah there are issues, and she doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A74\">want to have sex right now, or she had a healthI mean, an eating disorder \u2013 I mean, she has issues. What the fuck. I mean, so do I, you know what I mean? I don\u2019t know. I think what it is, is, I know for a fact, with all those, a lot of it was insecurity. That\u2019s an insecure person. Why aren\u2019t we having <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A75\">sex? And I let it \u2013 I could not think clearly. If this girl didn\u2019t care about you \u2013 she lives with you and left the place she wanted to be, that she had planned to be at, to be in this drizzly, shitty place with you. You know. And yeah, maybe it\u2019s a little difficult, maybe it\u2019s this, maybe it\u2019s that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A76\">but that is how these things are. Very few relationships are like \u201cYep, we met, and we\u2019ve been skipping down the street ever since\u201d. So that bums me out.

Also, I did feel like, even if you don\u2019t really want to have sex, that is weird to me, a little bit. You go <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">through phases, but our whole relationship was like that. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not totally second-guessing myself. I\u2019m just saying, to just cross a line over someone\u2019s name, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say, without sitting down, really talking it out \u2013 I\u2019ve never done that. Ever. I\u2019ve never had a conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF2\">that was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t really working for me, why don\u2019t we maybe go our own ways, or, what do you think?\u201d I\u2019ve never done that. It\u2019s always been like, I\u2019ll just either disappear, or there will be some \u2013 something will happen that I know I can use, kind of. Like \u201cOh, I can\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s too much. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF3\">being kind of this or that\u201d or something. You know what I\u2019m saying?

Exactly. So yeah. That\u2019s hard; I\u2019m having trouble letting that go. That\u2019s what\u2019s bumming me out.

Those things just, they\u2019re just, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Hard to swallow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard to swallow, especially when you combine it with some of those checklist things that I have, you know what I mean? I was really lucky. That streak there, was one after the other of like, you know what I mean? And now I\u2019m all like, \u201cI\u2019m older, blah blah blah\u201d, I don\u2019t even go out now, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">so I don\u2019t even have a chance to \u2013 like, I\u2019m just \u2013 you know what I mean? All these things combine to make you feel like, what the fuck. I\u2019m not going to find someone like that again. Now I really do have to settle, you know what I mean, I just have to find someone who\u2019s pretty enough, or who\u2019s cool <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B72\">enough, and, you know, just deal with it. You know what I mean? Whereas with those people, I felt that deep, deep, kind of passionate, you know. I didn\u2019t necessarily feel that with Kelly, remember? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I do remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: On one hand, that\u2019s healthy, I think, I guess, but, yeah, it\u2019s all very confusing.

So the fact that I\u2019m even thinking this much about it then bums me out, because I\u2019m like, \u201cClearly, that means I\u2019m not quite\u2026\u201d When it comes to that one \u2013 music, fine. Writing, fine. Friendships \u2013 everything\u2019s head and shoulders <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">better, right? That one thing is better, but proportionally it\u2019s not the same. There\u2019s still \u2013 deep down, I just feel like, as though I\u2019m not as \u2013 there\u2019s something about me that\u2019s, yeah they like me, but\u2026 you know what I mean, I\u2019m not quite\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Not quite\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, like, not quite\u2026 as attractive, not just physically, but there\u2019s just something, I don\u2019t know. Whatever, but there\u2019s something, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the feeling it sounds like haunts you throughout these relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Because even other things where I\u2019ve dated other girls here and there, much lesser things, like what happened? I go over them like, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I was just myself, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I didn\u2019t see anything weird\u2026 what happened there? Like, why didn\u2019t any of these girls \u2013 not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">there were that many \u2013 but there were a few that I thought could have been something, you know what I mean? What was the deal? And clearly, not everyone is meant for dating. That\u2019s okay, like obviously I\u2019m not into a shitload of girls that are probably really great. But, you know what I\u2019m saying? I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C72\">just feel like, well\u2026 In some ways I feel like I\u2019m the one doing the chasing, still. Which also isn\u2019t true, because obviously I\u2019ve been chased plenty of times, just not by the people I want to be chased by. Whatever. So, all that stuff just bums me out. I feel like the fact that I\u2019m even giving it so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C73\">much fucking bandwidth in my head is like \u201cWhat?\u201d you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: How could you not, though, Brian[?]?

Of course it\u2019s important, but I think it\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s the word. There\u2019s too much of a \u2013 it\u2019s unbalanced. You know what I mean? I mean, this is my more spiritual side talking here. Because life is short and you either \u2013 you\u2019re not going to find happiness with other people. You\u2019re going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">find fulfillment with other people, some kind of \u2013 but that is only going to happen when you have it. Do you know what I mean? So all this torture we go through with this kind of stuff, of course it\u2019s important, I mean you don\u2019t want to human contact, and love, I mean, it\u2019s super important. But I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D32\">just saying that it\u2019s important to also not let it outweigh things that are connected more to you, like your essence. Instead of like \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a girlfriend?\u201d The part that you\u2019re right about is, yeah, how could I not, in terms of the past things, yeah, I think this is just something I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D33\">to have to deal with right now, just because, I think I just feel so much better, and those things are just kind of, they\u2019re making me cringe, kind of, you know what I mean? Like, I was saying about UMass, remember? It\u2019s like that. I just feel kind of embarrassed \u2013 not embarrassed, I just feel like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D34\">what happened there? You know what I mean? It\u2019s almost like what I say about LA. I have memories, of like, yep, that was me, I did that, I remember that day, but I\u2019m like, what? Who was that guy? What was going on there? It was weird. And that\u2019s how I feel about Samantha, and Michelle, and Meredith. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D35\">Kelly, not so much.

It was just texting and e-mailing and you know, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just weird.

Where you look back, and you\u2019ve thought, you\u2019ve looked a million times, What was I thinking, or why wasn\u2019t my career in that place \u2013 I think this is another area where\u2026 the reason why I say it matters is, of course we don\u2019t want you to be haunted and preoccupied in a way that feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">obsessive, but to the degree that it is, it means there\u2019s something, you\u2019re actually getting to look back now, for the first time, with a very different set of eyes, and there\u2019s so much more to understand now, that I think we don\u2019t fully understand about what was happening, in each of those relationships. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD2\">I think there\u2019s a lot to know. Even if you can\u2019t change it, it still sounds like it feels confusing. You keep saying, \u201cWhat was I thinking? What was I thinking?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Well, because it worries me that there\u2019s something there that now is hindering me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Probably somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s what\u2019s worrying me, like, you know, why am I not going out?

Because generally I don\u2019t hear back, right? Am I still being attracted to like \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to replace Samantha and Meredith, that\u2019s what worries me. You know what I\u2019m saying? Now I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E32\">a different checklist. It\u2019s about these people that I dated once. So it\u2019s like \u201cOh, man. Does she remind me of Meredith, or of Samantha, or does she have that look, or that \u2013\u201d You know, that\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">[pause from 00:26:43 to 00:27:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Because I feel like in a way, this is \u2013 I mean there\u2019s a lot of other stuff, just day-to-day stresses, that are stopping me from, you know, like writing, I just cannot concentrate, you know?

So that in and of itself says a lot. See, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, all these things, they\u2019re just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">worrisome, a little bit, because I\u2019m not over that. I just can\u2019t \u2013 I mean, on the one \u2013 and then that\u2019s confusing, because like, well, you\u2019re attracted to what you\u2019re attracted \u2013 I mean I can\u2019t just suddenly be attracted to something completely -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but it can change, it actually can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: I mean, it kind of has changed. I mean, Uma isn\u2019t \u2013 she\u2019s not \u2013 she\u2019s pretty, but she\u2019s not, you know\u2026 But, yeah I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Brian, for you, love, the original love of your mother, was filled with stings and being unseen. So I do think there are ways the people you\u2019ve fallen for have repeated that, right, you were all about them, you weren\u2019t really seen, truly, you could remain invisible, and protected, and safe, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F91\">and put them on a pedestal, and then this craziness would come out more. An eating disorder or I don\u2019t want to have sex with you, or whatever was the form of stinging that would happen, because of something in her, but that you sort of have the radar for detecting that in others, as all people do, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F92\">find what is familiar. That\u2019s what love felt like. That\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever known, is that it comes with being stung, and being rejected. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Right. Right. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say, that all these things \u2013 that\u2019s what I mean by the insecurity, that it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s just from years and years of just not being [yawns] sorry \u2013 not being, like, a whole person, who is like, you know, unconditionally loved, and just, I mean, everything\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">just a downer, and critical, and this and that, so yeah, of course, like I\u2026 So then what happens is A) you get attracted to people like that, but then when you\u2019re in it, it\u2019s confusing, because you\u2019re like \u201cWell, it\u2019s probably because of me, she doesn\u2019t want to have sex\u201d. It\u2019s nothing to fucking do <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB2\">with me. She\u2019s got issues, you know what I mean? But yeah, it\u2019s very hard to parse all that out, and yeah. And then, but that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m trying to say, then what worries me, is that this is such a deep thing. It\u2019s not Meredith, or it\u2019s from years and years and years of this bullshit. Then you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB3\">like, what the fuck. Yeah, of course, it\u2019s changing, but that means that in that one area, it\u2019s still \u2013 I can\u2019t delineate things really well, so I\u2019m not sure about my decision-making, you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200FA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561746\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Something\u2019s changing in that Uma still feels like she\u2019s somebody you want to see and be around. It wasn\u2019t immediately \u201cOh, I want nothing to do with her anymore because she\u2019s actually a nice person\u201d, right? And yet, you also can feel like \u201cI don\u2019t even really feel like making out with her\u201d. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD1\">So there\u2019s a way, it\u2019s like, that\u2019s been what\u2019s been erotic, is someone rejecting. Someone who\u2019s enticing, and then rejecting, and then enticing, and then rejecting. And of course that\u2019s not going to work. You get hurt in the end, any person would. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s a good point too. Sexually, that\u2019s been the kind of formula. So when someone\u2019s just nice and whatever, it\u2019s kind of, like, a turn-off or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: It can feel boring, and not exciting. That\u2019s not \u2013 literally not what love was built up as, because of your relationship with your mother. And I don\u2019t know as much about your relationship with your father on this, because he matters too, but she\u2019s smothering, and then rejecting, and smothering, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201011\">and rejecting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: Well, those two things, my dad definitely wasn\u2019t. He was flawed, I\u2019m sure, I mean whatever, he had good things, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: We don\u2019t know much, for example, Brian, with him, about your paternal transference. I hardly know anything about that. He\u2019s pretty hazy to me as a character. Like, who he is to you, how he\u2019s built inside you, how that relatedness plays out with other people, and I think once you lose a parent <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">young, some of that gets frozen, like, it would be such a different conversation we would be having now, about all the different kinds of feelings you have about him, than if he were still here. He is going to matter too, I think your mom\u2019s in some ways easier because you know her character more. [Pause <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201052\">from 00:34:26 to 00:34:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s also, I think why it\u2019s hard for me \u2013 partly I think why it\u2019s hard for me to be with Assyrian women, or why I\u2019ve never \u2013 because that\u2019s \u2013 right? That\u2019s a clich\u00e9, right, it\u2019s too much like my mom. In a lot of immigrant communities, there\u2019s that, you know, that\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201071\">typical \u2013 you know, you have more smothering moms in immigrant communities, then if you\u2019re trying to get together with someone from that community, it just \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see her just as like a sexual \u2013 like a woman I\u2019d meet anywhere. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s part of this big family, that you\u2019re trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201072\">to not be so smothered by. [Pause from 00:35:23 to 00:35:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: I mean, I think the woman who\u2019s been, we said beguiling, a while ago, that\u2019s sort of decidedly not smothering you, right? Sort of removed, hard to get, someone you have to chase after. That protects you from feeling smothered. Right? So, I mean, just even look at that right now. The idea <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201091\">that you\u2019re chasing \u2013 you\u2019ve only interpreted in some ways as like, \u201cWhy am I not wanted?\u201d but actually you may be totally comfortable in that role, unconsciously, because then you don\u2019t have to feel smothered by her coming after you. When she\u2019s come after you, you <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: Well, the crazy thing is, yeah, I mean I do prefer that. I mean, I\u2019d much rather, if I had to pick, I would still pick, even now, I would pick, you know what I mean? I would rather have someone who\u2019s a little bit standoffish, than constantly driving me nuts. To me that\u2019s \u2013 any day, I would pick <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">that. The balance is \u2013 in a way, that\u2019s why Uma\u2019s cool. You know, she is totally not a smothering person, but she\u2019s also, as far as I can tell, like, a super, just kind of grounded, normal person, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2010A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561746\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">[Pause from 00:36:56 to 00:37:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your earliest memory with your mother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: Earliest? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a good question. You know, I don\u2019t know. Earliest memory. You know what\u2019s weird? I don\u2019t think I remember much until we moved to North Carolina, which is pretty old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really old. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">CLIENT: Right? Kindergarten. People remember things before kindergarten, right? Usually?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really remember anything here. You know what? Maybe I remember \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you were here. It was like an old-school, you know, like the soft-serve, and they had like an old sign of a cow, kind of like, worn out\u2026 and that playground was kind of a shitty \u2013 you know, that\u2019s pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201191\">new, what they\u2019ve done. So we would walk, she would take me up from that house that was torn down, my grandparents\u2019 house, to the ice cream store. The reason that I remember that is because on the right, there was this house that\u2019s still there, and they had those things in the lawn, like people put <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201192\">shit in their lawn? They had ducks, and I think we would stop and, you know, look at the ducks. So I kind of remember that. And I think I remember that the carriage was olive green. Yeah, I remember that. I think I remember that because the carriage was still there \u2013 I think it was in the basement or <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201193\">some shit, but\u2026 So I remember that, because I remember those ducks. Other things\u2026 I do remember sometimes going to visit my dad\u2019s family; they had a little black poodle. But not that many before I\u2019m like, five or four. Not that many. The gas station, I remember. Because we\u2019d go and they\u2019d either my <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201194\">uncle or my dad, or the guy across the street was also Assyrian, the grocer. We\u2019d go and he\u2019d give us Hostess Twinkies, or cupcakes, or whatever. So I kind of remember that. Is that, not weird, but does it mean something if you can\u2019t remember that much? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">THERAPIST: It could. I mean, what memories are getting consolidated, and what\u2019s not, and why not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">CLIENT: And I do remember that first apartment, when I was born, there was a grocery store on the bottom \u2013 like one of those little Italian \u2013 and my dad, after work, I think every day, or almost every day, would go there and get, like, a gumball, and like, wrap it in just a brown scrap paper bag thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D1\">and he\u2019d, like, give it to me, I remember that. I remember the old Assyrian lady who lived in the building. So yeah, I remember some stuff. I kind of remember the apartment, and the dark stairway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">THERAPIST: [whispers] tomorrow<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">CLIENT: Okay, thanks Claire.
