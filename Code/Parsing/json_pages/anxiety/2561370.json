Come on in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Not much has happened since Monday so I don't know what to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">(PAUSE): [00:01:34 00:03:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Sorry. Still thinking about what to say. I had a good day at school. I'm learning to be comfortable in my own skin I guess. (Pause) I'm thinking about hanging out socially with some of my classmates but I don't really know how to go about it. I guess I don't really know how to make new friends. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">Like earlier I just when I was living with Chris and my mom I would like kind of invite everyone over. Some people you have to hang out with in caf s and bars and stuff. So I don't yet know how to do that. That's not my scene. But I feel like I should do it just because I would like to make all kinds <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">of friends. And I guess most people are okay being who they are but I always feel the need to change or alter me. Maybe I'm not completely comfortable in my skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(PAUSE): [00:05:55 00:06:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Chris is being very nice and I feel very guilty about that. I guess no one really knows will he love me, will he hate me. He'll be so hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: How do you mean? What you're up to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well, I haven't told him details or anything like that. I'm going out with this other guy on the weekends, you know, like I did tell him earlier like a few weeks ago I met someone and you know, we kissed and that's all I said. Because at that time that's all that had happened. And still that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">all that's happened but still it's more like we see each other regularly. I don't know. I guess I'm thinking, like he's like my older brother and he's just my good friend now even though I cook for him and I stay over at his place a few times a week. You look very upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Upset?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I don't know. You looked upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: What are you doing? Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see. Maybe that's a projection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it probably is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Are you wondering what you're doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: What.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: You said that I'm wondering what you're doing and I said maybe it's a projection and I said oh, are you wondering what you're doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, I wonder all the time. I think I'm like just lost and hopelessly lost. I mean I'm hopefully lost. I have hope that's why I'm searching. I mean like I don't know. I guess I try not to be too judgmental but then I know that that just makes me give myself a free pass and do whatever, be irresponsible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">with other especially when it comes to other people's feelings. But then it's like yeah, I don't know which way to go about it to be harsh and just yeah. Or to be just like give myself a little leeway and I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(PAUSE): [00:10:13 00:11:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: It's not like other people seem to have it all together. It's just that they've gone through stuff and figured things out and maybe they've gone through stuff before me. Maybe they've already sorted through things. And maybe it's also true that they have certain kinds of support structures that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">I don't or maybe I did but pushed them away or don't make use of them. That's possible. And I was thinking that people who stay in long term relationships, how do they make it last a lifetime? Obviously, not everything stays the same. They have fights and they grow apart maybe or they have intimacy <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">problems and all kinds of problems and how to they, despite that, stay together? I guess, I can wonder about that to some extent but know the specifics of my case are very like different like I just started despising and hating it because of my own insecurities I guess, my own lack of success and confidence <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200373\">and all that. And it's taken a long time to learn that Chris has nothing to do with any of that. He's not responsible and but that makes me sad. Like shouldn't he be a little responsible? Shouldn't he have been again it's one of those should have, could haves.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561370\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Shouldn't he be responsible for -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well when I was so sad, you know, when I was falling down, shouldn't he have been a little concerned? Or no, he shouldn't have been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I'm not sure what you're referring to in particular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well, just the time when he got a job and I only got a whole bunch of rejections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: You feel he didn't care?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I didn't want him to care and he was all high and mighty and successful and climbing the charts, you know, climbing the ladder and he's busy and his work is so important and he's so important and I just felt very stupid and childish. And I can still feel that way when I think about that time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I guess I still haven't completely gotten over it. You know, he was in Rhode Island and we were chatting on Skype and I was like, 'I'm falling apart,' on Skype. I just wanted to push him away and not seek him out because I had sought him out when he was around earlier and it just didn't seem to go anywhere, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">you know? I guess I should have stepped up and taken care of myself but I remember even those moments were quite bleak, you know? Like him just working away and being preoccupied and me having a job and working on the weekend and the craft just not going anywhere and sharing pieces with him like, 'yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">okay, I've edited it, it's this, it's that. And then me looking at his edits and me going, 'wait,' (Unclear) the most glaring spelling mistakes or grammatical errors you know. And me feeling, 'what is this?' You know? That was just a completely bad time for all of us people. We were living together <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200434\">and there was no joy. There was no real intimacy. There was no I mean we all had some fun in the sense that I was making money and I was saving money and I was taking care of him and I was taking care of my mom and we all ate together and we cooked together and we threw parties for each other's birthdays <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200435\">except mine, but you know. I don't like celebrating my birthday. But you know, that picture. What do you think about that picture? It was all wholesome. No I won't give you adjectives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I can't comment on pictures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I don't feel like pictures give me any information about people's experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: But you do. I've noticed you say stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well, you know when I'm describing a dream or like an image and you're like, 'oh, that's that.' Or, 'that feels like that.' And, 'that sounds like that.' Do you want a specific example?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I try to describe how the experience seems to me which is different than saying, 'oh, that picture looks wholesome.' Because that would be me determining what people's experiences just from what things look like and I don't feel like I can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561370\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You feel like you can do that. In fact you feel like it's obvious. This picture means that these people feel this way. I don't think that's obvious at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: What do you mean? What's the difference between experience and picture like picture is static?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: A picture is from the outside in. Here's a scene. I don't know from that scene what people's experience of that scene is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But I feel like that's such at the root of one of the things that you struggle with. Like look at these people's lives. They look so great. They must be happy. They're married, they have two kids, they have a fancy home. They must be happy. I have no idea what they're feeling. They could <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">be completely miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: How do you look at it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: You don't see pictures then what do you see? You see film? Oh, I don't know, yeah. How do you visualize them in their experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I don't know what their experience is. I don't assume a particular kind of experience. I might have an experience of that picture but I don't know what their experience is. Am I to assume that my experience is their experience? Because my experience is how I would feel in that situation which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">may have nothing to do with how they feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't even understand how you visualize others. How do you visualize things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: What kind of things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Me. Like how do you visualize me? Or how do you visualize someone you're curious about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: How do you mean \"visualize\"? I guess maybe I don't understand how you're using that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Well I mean I'm just curious about what like how our educational experiences have been that different that you know, I've been trained to look at art or there's been this whole training of modern life where you look at static images and draw inferences and that's the whole I guess that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">my experience of say a painting. So you extrapolate that to looking at people everywhere like that as a static image. And you know, Facebook, and all that, that reinforces that idea, I guess. I mean, I don't know. Maybe this is too abstract. I know it is for me, but like that's the impressionistic idea <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">I have of all the world and people and like their lives are like a series of static images strung together and each experience, each image has it's true for that point in time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: I guess I find that a little confusing because an image is not if your image is not something you see as something somebody else sees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: No, you see it too. If you drew it, you can see it. I mean that's, I guess that's what you're saying, right? The root of the problem is that I see myself from the outside in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: You do. But and I would argue further it's not I would say that you can't see yourself from the outside in. You make assumptions. You're really actually seeing yourself from the inside in and assuming that it's from the outside in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Can you give an example?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. I mean, people looking down on you and thinking they're so superior. You don't know what these people are thinking. That's how you see yourself looking on the inside in and then assuming that that's the image that is other's people's image of you whereas that may have nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">to do with their image of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561370\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">(PAUSE): [00:21:56 00:22:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: I get very, very pissed to think that people have no image, you know? Really, that's what my whole life is all about to make art out of myself, my circumstances and to present that to people and for them to have a very, very profound emotional response. To gawk at it, to love it, to fear it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">like remember it. That is my goal. And I feel very I feel cheated, I feel gypped when they have no response or when they take it lightly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">(PAUSE): [00:23:13 00:23:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: I used to have this friend I guess he's a friend, this guy who used to be very much interested in me or in high school back in Nepal, like we were 16 or 15 or something, he'd had a crush on me for three years and then I told him I was coming here and several years later he like he's working <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">and I guess he has money, he's successful, and we've met like three or four times just as friends. I was very mean to him, like rude to him but he's always like just on the surface like, 'hey, what's up? What's going on?' And I'm like, 'what have you experienced in life? You haven't even kissed a girl. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200812\">All you do is work,' and he's like, 'oh, that's all right, why are you so pessimistic?' And I'm like, wait until you walk in my shoes, you know, walk a mile in my shoes. And then he's like, 'okay, fine, I won't comment.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: What did you mean by that? \"Wait till you walk a mile in my shoes\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Well I just he's like why are you so pessimistic? Why aren't you so happy go lucky like him? And I'm like there's so many things to get angry about you know just for me personally and around the world, there are so many things that could go wrong and he was like silently making lots of money <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">and that's all he does and that just makes me go, 'oh.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Is that why you're mean to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Kind of. That's what I was saying, right? Like I want people to dig deep. I want them to have a profound emotional experience based on the art that I make of my life and present to them when that happens. But just generally to feel deeper, you know, and people who just float by on the surface <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">just really piss me off, especially people whom I would like to dig deep, you know? Or who profess to like me or love me. I'm like, 'how the hell can you say that when you haven't even scratched the surface?' That's what it was. That I remember. I was so pissed when he told me he loved me. I was, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200892\">know, 15. I was, 'Wait a second, you don't know anything about me. You don't know what my dad's done. And you don't know the day to day environment that I live in. How in the hell can you say that you love me based on just seeing me for a few hours every day in class?' Yes, in class, I'm fabulous. I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200893\">smart and well maybe not fabulous but that's just a fa ade, you know?'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: What should he have seen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: What I just said, you know? Like the day to day hell. I think that really pissed me off and that really scared me that love could be so superficial. I'm really scared of that like when Chris says anyone says, 'I love you.' And I'm just like, 'bullshit' you know. No one can love you know, when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">they see the muck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Can someone loving you never be true?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561370\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think my dad would say that and obviously it was a big lie. He would say this and he would be drunk or something and just be all, 'I'd do anything for you. I'd rob a bank and help you that's weird, but he would have a very profound emotional experience and that was just really not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">true, you know? Or maybe it was true but all the other times when he was sober he was not feeling so maybe profound emotional experiences are lies. Maybe what is true is just what it is on the surface. That is what my conundrum is. So maybe I should only believe people who don't say, 'I love you,' <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">who don't profess to have some kind of a deeper understanding, who are just like, 'hey.' You know, 'how are you?' and 'bye.' Are like, 'let's have a drink,' and that's it. I guess I'm in a phase where I'm like, 'I'll take that,' instead of running away from Chris and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">(PAUSE): [00:29:27 00:29:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Do you know what love is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Why do you think that question is important to you right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: I guess that's what I'm struggling with like I don't know if you have a different perspective on my rant.

I guess he does in cute ways but it was supposed to be a profound moment. When was it? I wish I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">tell you maybe last year. Yeah, September or October. But at that point I have to keep track of but at that time I was still thinking about his friend, you know. And I had that information in my hand but I didn't know what to do with it. So it was like this thing in my hand like this bright fish <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E12\">that we'd just caught and it was supposed to be beautiful and it was supposed to be delicious but I felt like I didn't have cooking oil, I didn't have a gas stove so I could cook it right away and share it with him.
