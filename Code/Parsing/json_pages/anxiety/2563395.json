We go over the Chapter 5 problems quickly, there\u2019s only four of them, and I needed to make sure I had them to do. Take Test 3 the second time, and immediately take the mid-term right afterwards, get out of there some time around 8:00, go down to Georgetown, hit up my drug dealer and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">buy some weed so I don\u2019t want to kill myself every day. And then the new plan is this, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Have you been feeling like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s been pretty bad. It\u2019s been pretty bad. The last couple days have been really bad. Last night I was so furious. I hit my hurt my pinkie a little bit hammer fisting my book. Ripped pages out of it, had to tape them back in. The point where my dog was not only trembling but hyperventilating, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">which is signs of other respiratory failure or a potential heart attack. So I\u2019m like, well, if it terrified my dog, you know. But I couldn\u2019t calm down, I couldn\u2019t calm down. And I was like\u2026 you know, so I double-fisted some Klonopin. I was like make that a good one and then I\u2019d see if that helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: How much did you take?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Oh, just a milligram, or whatever it is. So two pills. So they\u2019re 0.5 each, you can take six a day before you develop physical dependency. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Did it help?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: A little bit. A little bit. But then I had to\u2026 Yeah, and so I was thinking, like what do I do? Like what\u2019s the thing that stops this? What stops this rage and this situation where the only thing I can think of is that probably I should kill myself? What stops this? [unclear] stops it. It stops <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">it, you know. When I\u2019m going too fast I can drink a Manhattan, it\u2019ll bring me down just a little bit. If I\u2019m already down then there\u2019s I shouldn\u2019t drink alcohol because that\u2019ll put me further down. So I need some weed and weed brings me back up again. So\u2026 But then like once I have weed I have to smoke <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">weed until it\u2019s gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:02:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right? So what do I do, considering I have more work to do. Because I have to take the mid-term again, probably Thursday, to increase my score to [unclear] today, and I\u2019m completely exhausted, and I have to take the mid-term today. Well, on Wednesday, as I had previously assumed. But I misread <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">the initial number something. So I found that out on Sunday and that is what triggered a bunch of this. It was like, \u201cOh shit! I have three fewer days to get this done.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what triggered\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Just spiraling of depression and rage and frustration. Especially when I\u2019m going through, I\u2019m like looking at his answer key and I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d Like this is clearly wrong, and I can prove it. You know, and like\u2026 He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, use Table 3.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck is Table\u00a03?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">You know. And he\u2019s just\u2026 So I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. Okay. There\u2019s only a few errors I found in your answer key over the course of everything, but still it\u2019s negligence, you know. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">So [unclear], the plan is this. This is the plan for survival, Carl. And I\u2019ve been considering this for a little bit, like how to go about doing this. Considering that\u2026 [pause] Wow, that\u2019s CNR. That\u2019s [inaudible], that\u2019s different. Okay, so considering that psychiatrists are like, \u201cOh, you know if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">smoke weed and you\u2019re bipolar too it completely destroys you. Completely destroys you.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, actually that\u2019s the opposite.\u201d It\u2019s like I\u2019m bipolar, trying to smoke weed, and it keeps me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563395\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. [0:04:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: So I\u2019m like, okay. So given that lithium made me want to kill myself, but it doesn\u2019t do that. You know, given that weed makes me feel better but it\u2019s not supposed to do that. Drugs have always affected me differently. Like this has always been the case throughout my life. Because this is because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">I was conceived during a one-month acid trip. Who knows. Wrappers of the cocaine my father rubbed on my gums when I was teething as a numbing agent. Who knows. Who knows. Perhaps is a combination of the bipolar I and bipolar II and the Tourette\u2019s gene which is latent within me. You know, I mean. Who <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">knows, you know. But [we\u2019re getting to?].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">So given that. Given that I have very little faith in psychiatry at this point, right, you know. And that with them continually told me and continually told me it does not seem to be actually working. Right. [unclear] pretty well. [unclear] seems to work pretty well, you know, [unclear] what\u2019s gotten <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">me into this state. And [] was like, \u201cThis is far preferable to where you were six or seven, eight years ago.\u201d You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like incredibly preferable, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: There are still triggering events, you know, that I recognize. You know, extreme stress triggers these events. And like realization of my incapability of performing actions that I know will make me feel better is another triggering event. I caught this\u2026 and finally after years would go out and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">do errands, you know. [I\u2019m all stressed, I want to move?], we go and we do errands. Which means we go out to like\u2026 [unclear] Home Depot for something I need, probably at Costco for a few things we need. Hit Petco, you know. And they\u2019re all in the same plaza, way out there by the one Chucky Cheese remaining <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">in the state of, you know, the union. [chuckles] You know. And [unclear] an entire evening. So\u2026 Let\u2019s see. So\u2026 [0:06:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">But then we\u2019d go to Target last, and Target might get\u2026 we might get some food stuffs, we might get some other stuff. But back when I had jobs the end run of Target was always at the video game section. We\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll buy some [], or I\u2019ll think of this thing.\u201d You know, or like, \u201cAh, nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">here I want. Whatever. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d But going into Target and being unable to buy things I want to buy because I know that will make me feel better is a trigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: You know. As soon as I get out of there I\u2019m out of juice and I always go into this\u2026 I go down, I\u2019ll go down, I\u2019ll go down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: So the key is dealing with triggers, but the triggers cannot be avoided.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right? They all\u2026 they exist, you know. And made Ginny break down in tears years ago, she has this\u2026 you know, it\u2019s chronic back spasm. You know, she couldn\u2019t make it stop. And the first doctor she went to was like, \u201cWell, try removing the stress from your life.\u201d Like that was her answer. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">can you imagine being a medical doctor and suggesting to someone to cure their problems they remove the stress from their life.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563395\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right. You\u2019re not going to remove all the triggers. [0:08:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Right, how would this thing even be possible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So just complete idiocy, and it makes me want to strangle\u2026 And this is the motion, this is Tai Chi, so the tea cup. But this is taking out a trachea. So. And the way it turns and the trachea comes away, or it really snaps or shatters or breaks. Then it gets\u2026 I\u2019m not here to talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">all the various ways to kill someone with your bear hands. You know, that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. Let\u2019s get back to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">So the plan is that\u2026 I think back to when I was working and smoking weed, right. And the problem is now is I wake up, I\u2019m like there\u2019s nothing to do, might as well smoke some weed. But [then I\u2019ll go with my day?] and I smoke weed throughout the day. Then I go to sleep, wake up, repeat the pattern. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">puts me in a deeper state of uselessness as time goes on, just built a tolerance over the course of the week So then I was thinking, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re just smoking weed to maintain a state of like\u2026 [exhales],\u201d [hoping that?]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:09:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: You know. Which is not useful, considering I have stuff to do. So my plan is this, I\u2019m like, okay, this is what I\u2019ll have to do. I still see you. See, I\u2019m [unclear]. But the plan is this, is that what if I start days as if I\u2019m going to work. Right. I wake up and I\u2019ve got some things to do which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">are work, right, the things which I don\u2019t do when I\u2019m high, like making the fucking voice reel, like fucking doing my yoga. You know, it\u2019s like putting out some more job stuff. You know, what\u2026 [pause] Yeah, start with that. Get a few hours of that out of the way. And do some work, get some of that shit <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">out of the work. On some days wake up, [go hitting the board?], go directly to the work lab and sit down and do work and help the tutors and like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea. [0:10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: And then I can have the weed after that. And like make sure the shit I\u2019m getting done in the morning is the first thing [alone?]. So it\u2019s like smoking cigarettes, you\u2019ll have to wake up in the morning and have a cigarette first thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like [inhales]. It\u2019s so nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah. The other thing to say is that\u2026 and you know, I\u2019ve got a couple more names for you to try out\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Oh, thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: \u2026 for a psychiatrist.

So saw a good friend Friday, and we have dinner at that flatbreads place, the flatbreads and bowling where it\u2019s a hipster hangout. \u201cLots of\u2026\u201d The guy I came with, \u201cI\u2019m here, there\u2019s a lot of flannel.\u201d And I haven\u2019t seen him in ten years, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F1\">he lives in Chicago, he\u2019s got twin boys. And he\u2019s the intersection of tech and finance. So he works at a tech company that does financial software and he\u2019s the tech guy that they send up when like the sales guy can\u2019t answer questions, \u201cOh, you need to talk to Max.\u201d He just grabs it and goes in, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F2\">tech guy grumbles some stuff at him, he gives some answers, the tech guys grumbles some stuff, and then Max shuts him down. You know, he\u2019s like tech answers, boom. And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well, okay.\u201d [0:22:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">So he was out here doing that. And he was like, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s catch some dinner.\u201d And I saw [Tab?], saw [unclear], and he\u2019s another tech guy. His wife and kids are away for the week so he\u2019s just reverted to bachelorhood, which for him means building computers, he\u2019s building like three computers this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201511\">week. And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, here\u2019s my computer!\u201d So he\u2019s just putting those together. And there\u2019s Adam. So afterwards Adam\u2019s giving me a ride home and he\u2019s like, \u201cI need to borrow your analytical skills.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, sure. What do you mean?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m in over my head at my company.\u201d This <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201512\">is some place that we\u2019ve been in talks three times and it\u2019s never worked out, and he\u2019s working there now as a product manager. And he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m out of my depth.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m reacting, I\u2019m not planning, I\u2019m out of my\u2026\u201d He\u2019s describing the panic state. But he\u2019s like, \u201cLet\u2019s talk [about Hunter?].\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201513\">You know, it\u2019s like this is\u2026 because eventually you wouldn\u2019t [go to the point your incompetent?], and like that\u2019s what he\u2019s struggling with right now. You choose one of two things, either you need to get an assistant or they\u2019re going to hire you a boss. Or they\u2019re going to hire someone who can do what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201514\">you do and replace you. And he\u2019s like, the good news is they take a really long time to fire anyway. He\u2019s like, \u201cSo that\u2019s great. It takes a really long time to fire anyone where I am.\u201d And they\u2019re more likely to hire a new assistant than hire a new boss.

You know, it\u2019s like this is the solution. I mean, they\u2019re like these cubes that glow slightly with this sort of amorphous greenish\/purplish substance. That\u2019s what thoughts look like.

Doesn\u2019t take too long. So there I am. And that and the threat of war with Russia. I mean, that\u2019s super exciting. Putin\u2019s like, \u201cHey Syria. Let\u2019s all be cool about Syria. Oh, by the way, we\u2019re invading Kiev and the Ukraine.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cThere will be costs.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F1\">Really, what are they? Because we did it.

This shows again, the president\u2019s simply a puppet. Just a puppet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">So these are also stressors, right, that I have to figure out a country to move to. Kind of like, what country should I retire to? Because [I don\u2019t like this one?]. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best idea. We\u2019re a declining empire right now, we need to be cognizant of that. Meanwhile Sweden.

[laughter] Barbed wires around them. Yeah, [unclear]. But, you know, my father was in the auto industry while he was in jail. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201691\">That\u2019s what my grandmother put it in the family newsletter.

They\u2019ve all been <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D1\">captured by serial killers too, they really need assistance, they\u2019re all trapped there. And it\u2019s that time of day when the serial killer comes down the stairs and decides\u2026 chooses one of us, and he\u2019s like, \u201cHere\u2019s how I\u2019m going to torture you today,\u201d and he gives them a choice of how I\u2019m going to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D2\">it.

I wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201711\">restrained. He had a weapon with which I could kill him. I\u2019m like, and the other guy, [he\u2019s not going to stop me with?] a gun. That\u2019s a little body shield I can use and I can take the gun, then I\u2019ve got a gun and I can kill the other guy. I\u2019m like, that was a completely solvable situation. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201712\">why I was so worried. I\u2019ve got all the skills and tools necessary to solve that entire situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: But you felt [under siege as it were?], huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah.

There\u2019s three parts to the question, I answered all <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202832\">three, they marked A and B correct and they forgot to put a red check next to C.\u201d And that\u2019s the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20285\">THERAPIST: They got part C wrong.
