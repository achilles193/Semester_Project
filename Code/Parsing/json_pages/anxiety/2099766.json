And how many hops away various people are from knowing each other. And a lot was made up numbers to prove a point but \u2013 (chuckles). He ended up demonstrating <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">to my satisfaction that no there isn't such a thing as karma. It's just random happenstance. (laughter) But there has just been a \u2013 I don't know. A lot of stuff in the last few weeks that have been reminding me of my bad ex-boyfriend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: And I was sort of feeling like \u2013 the thing I said that Dave said was ridiculous that prompted all of this was \"I feel like I dared the universe to stir up all these old memories and take all this old business off the table and make me deal with it.\" But messaging Ashley on (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: That's going to be part of it. But there has been other stuff that's completely unrelated to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(inaudible at 00:01:44) or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. So what happened was \u2013 going back to last summer. There was \u2013 I don't even remember what happened. But there was something that happened in the Science Fiction publishing world that made me angry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: And so I talked to Dave about maybe we could subsidize one of these magazines that doesn't suck so they can pay a pro rate to their authors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: So that would've ended up costing about twelve hundred dollars a year. And Dave was like, \"Are you kidding me?

The magazine that I picked which is one that I really enjoy reading \u2013 Expanded Horizons \u2013 one of the editors is someone I know through the Internet. And have known for a while through the Internet. And they have a co-editor named Zappa who I thought I didn't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: As it turns out Zappa went to school with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Zappa was an online pseudonym. Zappa was actually a person who used to be best friends with my evil ex-boyfriend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: And had angst about me. I don't know. So I was talking to the person I know who is at this magazine (inaudible). And said, \"How much would it cost \u2013\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: The editor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Mm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: He's the editor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: And said, \"How much would it cost \u2013 let's talk numbers.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: \"What do you need?\" And (inaudible at 00:03:17) said, \"I want to bring in my co-editor on this.\" And I said, \"Sure that's fine.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: As long as it's somebody I never knew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well no. Like that's fine. (inaudible at 00:03:27)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Right. So anyway I was having this conversation with (inaudible at 00:03:32) where he was going to forward my e-mail to Zappa. And then three days later I get an IM from my friend Lori who I also went to school with. I've known since we were freshmen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:03:41) so Zappa thinks they know you but isn't sure and really wants to know your legal name. Because I was using a pseudonym on the Internet.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099766\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: And I said, \"Well why does Zappa think they know me?\" And Lori said \"Well Zappa went to school with us and graduated in 2003. So there is a good likelihood.\" I was like, \"Oh. A person from school. And not (inaudible at 00:04:05) feel better.\" And a few hours later I get another IM message saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">\"Zappa is completely freaking out.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">Like what do you want me to do about that? (chuckles) So according to Lori, Zappa has been continuously freaking out at Lori about my identity since last summer. (pause at 00:04:27 until 00:04:33) And I still have \u2013 at that point I still had no idea who this person was. So I said, \"Ask Zappa for information <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">to tell me their legal name so I have some idea who they are.\" Because all I'm hearing was \"Zappa thinks I'm a terrible person. I think they're a terrible person. Thinks that I want to invest in the magazine to take it over from them.\" All kinds of like \u2013 well there is no evidence for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: But like Lori never got Zappa's permission to tell me who Zappa was. As it turns out Zappa showed up to a dinner party last night that I was at. And I did not in fact recognize Zappa. It was as if I had met them for the first time but as we've talked about before I have major holes in my memory <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">from \u2013. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right. Right. Do you mind if I just shut the shades behind you a little bit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Oh sure. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Because \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: And I realize this is starting to sound Days of Our Lives but bear with me. It starts to make sense. It's possible I've been introduced to Zappa before and I just don't remember it. But I'm sure we never really actually knew each other knew each other. But after the dinner party I was driving <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">Lori back to her girlfriend's house she's visiting from out of town. Lori lives in Montana. But I was driving Lori back to her girlfriend's house \u2013. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Had you prior to last night known who Zappa was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: No. No idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: I was like \u2013 so the woman sitting next to you at dinner I thought was Zappa. Right? Because I have been trying to figure it out. Not putting a lot of effort into it but for example I was getting lunch with a group friends a couple of Saturdays ago and we were talking about various gossip in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">our community and someone mentioned Zappa's name. And I said, \"Oh you know Zappa? I've been trying to figure out who they are because they think they know me from college. And I don't remember them.\" He like described them to me. Like that sort of \u2013 not expending a lot of effort or (inaudible at 00:06:40) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F2\">over it. But you know if the opportunity came up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible at 00:06:41) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: But anyway. So I said, \"Lori was that person sitting next to you Zappa?\" Because the person sitting next to her at dinner was wearing a (inaudible at 00:06:50) and had mentioned being class of \u201803 and had mentioned going to law school and had mentioned a couple of hobbies that I know Zappa has. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">And Lori is like, \"Yeah that was Zappa.\" I was like, \"I am completely confident I don't know this person. Their face is not familiar to me. Like nothing about them is familiar to me. \" And Lori is like, \"Oh well that Zappa. Don't tell them I told you that.\" I was like, \"Oh! Okay that makes sense.\" Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200732\">she had been best friends with my evil ex-boyfriend back in the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099766\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Back in the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: So I was like, \"Why does she think I hate her? And why does she think I want to steal her magazine from her?\" I was going to make a donation for God's sake. So as it turns out Zappa dated my evil ex after I did. And thinks I think she stole him from me. And also their relationship was just as <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">abusive and terrible as mine was with him except Zappa never really came to terms with that. Or put the blame where it lies on the abusive boyfriend. So there is just like a mess of \u2013 I don't even want to speculate about what's going on in their head. But they are very clearly dealing with some shit <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. They being Zappa?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Sorry. Zappa prefers gender neutral pronouns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: So do many of my friends, which makes the number of the pronouns I use sometimes unclear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Gotcha. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: So yeah. That \u2013 (pause at 00:08:46 until 00:08:54) I mean obviously I can't manage Zappa's anxieties for them or like really do anything about this but both (inaudible at 00:09:03) and Lori contacted me late last night to say, \"Someone I know who does not want to named would like your e-mail <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">address so they can get in touch with you. Can I have permission to give them your e-mail address?\" It's like \"Oh God. Sure. Fine.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Do you know about how many times you had met or seen Zappa in college? I know part of the point is you really can't remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean \u2013 well so after Phil and I broke up things were really ugly. And I ended up having to walk away from a bunch of social circles. Like people were picking sides and driving me out. And so at most there was a span of about eighteen months where we would have run into each other. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">don't know. We might have run into other at gaming nights and parties a couple of dozen times maybe at most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: (sighs) And of course I was a very different person then. I was a very reactionary right wing conservative. Appalling politics. Very in your face evangelical Christian. There are a lot of people who knew me then who really disliked me with good reason. So that could be but \u2013 I don't know. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">don't get the sense that that's actually the issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: From what Lori has told me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah I mean what you've described relates it much more to having dated Phil after you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: I feel bad for them. I feel a little bit guilty that I didn't tell people how terrible Phil really was. I kept a lot of it private out of shame and guilt and all of that. I didn't really talk about it to anyone until years and years after the fact. And part of me wonders if I had told people <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">about some of the terrible things Phil did to me like maybe they wouldn't have dated Phil. And then wouldn't be scarred and traumatized now. And I don't know. (pause at 00:11:40 until 00:13:26)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well \u2013sorry. From what I understand you're terrified about being judged in terms of who you were then. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yes.

(pause at 00:15:16 until 00:15:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you're also feeling a kind of a longing to be (inaudible at 00:15:47) a little more. Or to know that the people around (inaudible) a little more. Kind of who you were and how you've changed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Meaning? (pause at 00:15:57 until 00:16:09)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Well I feel like you also want to come to terms with who you were then and how it would be okay with the people (inaudible at 00:16:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Mm. Yeah but nothing about the things I did was (inaudible at 00:16:25). I mean I guess I have to come to peace with that first before I can (inaudible at 00:16:33). People I know being able to deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I guess you told me about a bit of it but I imagine you're pretty wary of that. Saying more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Well not just that but it's painful to think about even if I'm not talking about it. Right? Like it's not so much about if I say the words I'll be judged. It's thinking about them and remembering them is difficult and painful and unpleasant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see. And \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: I mean my values and ethics have changed so much and so many of the things that I did which I thought at the time were completely justified are just horrifying to me now. (pause at 00:17:29 until 00:17:51)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I can see you really don't like who you were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: No. (pause at 00:17:53 until 00:18:06)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Do you feel hateful towards who you were then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: I always feel hateful towards myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: I don't feel particularly more hateful to the myself I was then than I do any other version of myself. I think I'm just embarrassed. (pause at 00:18:34 until 00:19:38)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I see. And I gather most of it it's really painful and (inaudible) to think about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And you're being confronted with it because of stuff that's going on now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: I mean I knew that this would happen when I messaged Ashley (inaudible at 00:20:01). This does not surprise me in the least. I mean the thing with Zappa surprises me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: But the overall theme of facing old business doesn't surprise me. And I think I'm doing a relatively good job of coping. And I'd also say things with Ashley are going well enough that it has definitely been worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: That doesn't make it easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause at 00:20:30 until 00:20:43)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: And I wasn't prepared for the guilt that I'm feeling over having not told people. Having not disclosed about everything. Some of the other stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: At the time. And I mean I know my politics say that (inaudible at 00:21:08) has an obligation to disclose your report. And you do what you have to do to stay safe and sane. And that's all fine and good as political theory or as social policy but it's not doing much good to make me stop feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">guilty for not telling people.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099766\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Right. You're saying it's nobody else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Mm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Nobody else has an obligation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yes because I have a double standard for myself. I mean even recognizing that it's a double standard and that this is a known character flaw of mine that I set double standards for myself that are much higher than for anyone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. My impression \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: But it doesn't change the feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: My impression is it's a lot along the lines of wishing you could've protected some other people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.

(pause at 00:25:24 until 00:26:57) And of course all of my feelings about Phil and the past me and Zappa and all of those are blurring together with thoughts and feelings about my parents. I don't know.

They actually did hit me. Never bad enough to leave marks or put me in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201131\">the hospital or anything (inaudible) but they hit both of us (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">Really violent with my younger sister.
