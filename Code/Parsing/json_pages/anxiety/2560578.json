I hope some things that are vitally important I will still think are important such as my book and my writing and everything. But like the fight with that girl like I saw her at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">an event and we were civil so I don't think I'll have a heart to heart with her any time soon but we can still be part of the same group and still be civil to each other. I think that will still work. That's like the panic button that I was pressing because she didn't give me an essay seems to not matter <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">so much now. It did at that time. I guess I don't understand like just by her being mad at me at that moment why I got so scared and I left the place and like the next couple of days I was so upset and really shaken up. I don't really understand that behavior that reaction. I mean at the time it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">happening and I was feeling all those things but now I'm like I mean I guess I can still see that I would feel the same way I that happened right now but yeah. Mainly I guess I'm still the same insecure person. I just glad I could get at that spot based on what happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(PAUSE): [00:05:15 00:05:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I'm trying to like making sense of that will help or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Well things can sometimes feel like a crisis for you. You feel the emotions so intensely and it's like you have to do something immediately which is why you sometimes have to burst out sometimes with something to say, you have to do something and then it seems like after a little bit of time <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">the sort of crisis dissipates and you're not sure why there was such urgency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It's kind of like the rat poisoning. It seemed like it was very impulsive though you continued to feel bad that sense of urgency, once it dies, it's like what was going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's like a pressure chamber in my head like there's no outlet and it just keeps building and there's just like an explosion, implosion I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(PAUSE): [00:06:49 00:06:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I guess like this weekend like with my mom felt sick. She had a fever. I didn't really see her that much. We had an event that our women's group put together and so she came to that. She cooked food and then she said she felt sick but I only spent an hour with her after that and then I had to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">go somewhere. And then the next morning I wanted to go to her place the first thing and give her medicine bring her medicine, but I couldn't leave Nelson's place until 12 and then I had a meeting with my colleagues at 12:30 so like I was leaving at 12 and he was like can I drop you and I was so mad, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">I was like I was supposed to get out of here at 11 and it's an hour later and I have to go to my mom's. So I stormed out like yelling and screaming and then I was like, wow, I guess I'll never see this guy again which is good because I'm trying to break up with him anyway and then I had my meeting which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">went on until 4 and then I went to my mom's with medicine. I just felt so horribly guilty and I was shocking to my colleague. When I got to the meeting he was like, 'what's wrong?' And I was like, 'I feel guilty.' And he said that's coming from you. And he was telling me about his mom. He's actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">two years older than me and his mom passed away long ago so I just started crying for him like I just cannot imagine what you went through. I just felt so close to him at that moment. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560578\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: That he lost his mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I felt like holding him like a mother. I felt very motherly then. He and I talk a lot. I tell him everything. At that moment I felt for him very intensely. Not for myself. It was like I'll be fine. Of course, I would think I'll be fine, I always think, I worry in my panic but what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">he went through and all it's just like I cannot even fathom. I just felt like I was juggling a lot this weekend which is it doesn't register for me. I don't plan for things so then things kind of fall apart or I'm not able to do something that I wanted to do and that just makes me crazy. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">I should plan for stuff. I don't know what to blame. I feel like I don't have a home, that's why I'm panicking. This is becoming to me I feel like it's a problem. I don't know if it's a problem right now in denial mode about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: About?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Like I have my own apartment like not my own, I share, I rent, I have roommates and I've been paying rent for four months but I don't really spend any time there. So I'm making all kinds of excuses it's dirty, I don't like it. Like inches away they're working on a building and it's very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">noisy so all that. But just it makes me feel horrible the start of every month when I have to write that check and be like this is money down the drain, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Where are you living?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I'm mostly I live at I spend most of my time at Chris's place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Does he know that you're seeing someone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean he's not there most of the time so it's just like a quiet place and it's clean because I clean it. It's pretty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Where do you sleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Can we not get into that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Because I don't want to get into it right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Because I might be able to change it in a month or two but right now it's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: So you don't want to talk about it because you don't feel that you can change it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Are you embarrassed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: No I just don't want to talk about it. Maybe I'm embarrassed but it feels like it's silly, more than anything, but my hair's falling down. Yeah, I feel like maybe that's my problem like I don't have a base or something or I don't know. I want to live on my own with no roommates. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">maybe that will make me stay at my place. I don't like it. I don't like that place. But yeah, so I don't think this conversation has a thread today. Yeah it's felt really guilty because I couldn't give, bring medicines to my mom like in the morning but then you know and I was like yeah, like I'm not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">going to talk to [Nelson] (ph) and like he will like I'm trying to end it anyway but then at 5 I called him and he spoke like nothing had happened and then later on he's saying that that's the way that five years ago he would have gotten really mad but now he's like that's what you do when you are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200453\">stressed so I just take it at face value and I was like I don't know what to think about like I feel weird about that, like it makes no difference to you that I lashed out? And I was like fine, whatever. And then we were talking and he was like he doesn't feel as guilty about his parents being all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200454\">way in Nepal and him not being able to do anything for them. Like, I feel guilty all the time. I guess I was thinking of the conversations that we had had about feeling fused with my mom and trying to separate from her but then like this voice in my head going no that's such a betrayal and I don't want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200455\">to do that and I want to be there for her and like I'll cut corners and like I'll go forward with her and not charge forward by myself for my greed or my selfish interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560578\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: What did you get angry at [Nelson] (ph) about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: About well like we woke up and like I feel like he's so lazy. He just kept staying in bed and he's like for 10 minutes just lie there and not say anything. And I was like, 'I have to get up.' It's 9:30 and I have to leave. And so I was mad at him. I guess I feel like he's not serious enough. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">He's always like silly. He's not as serious as Chris who's always serious. I'm the silly one in that relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And what did you say to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: To who?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: To [Nelson] (ph), you said that you got mad at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just kind of stormed out. He said you know, like I'll drop you. And I said no, I don't have time. And I just kind of I'm already late and what the fuck is going on and that's it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">(PAUSE): [00:17:32 00:18:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I don't know, I just feel like I wish I would just pause and do things more consciously. I feel like I do I run on auto pilot a lot and like not process things because they're too hard like running away from them or living in denial. I wish I could stop. I keep telling myself, 'once the semester <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">ends I'll change, I'll stop.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">(PAUSE): [00:19:00 00:19:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Like being alone. I still don't get it. I guess I am alone during the week from morning till evening but to me that no home is still the conundrum. I mean I tried staying in that apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: What does it feel like when you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I've done like maybe five times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: What were those times like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: The kitchen is smelly and now that girl is there. She's like 25 and very messy and dirty so I don't want to clean up after her. And the bathroom was dirty. But my room is nice. It smells nice and looks nice. But I can't just keep being holed up in my room. I don't know. I like the idea of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">sometimes. I could wake up and read something. Read a book or I could make tea the way I want to and drink it by myself. I could watch good films and work for as long as I want to. But then the idea of like stepping out and getting my own dinner, like something about the kitchen I feel like it depresses <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200612\">me and like I can't change it, I feel like put away all the dirty pans and wash them or like change the lighting, cook something nice. I don't know. I guess I could do it but I feel like I don't have the power to do it. I don't know. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I'm not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don't want my roommates there. I don't like them. I don't know them. I don't want to get to know them. Yeah. I want to change the way that things look right now, but I don't know if I can because it's not my space.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560578\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: It's partially your space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah. But then I want to earn brownie points with Chris. Like I want to cook at his place because then I feed him and there would be food for him and me and he'd be paying for the groceries. So I'll save a little money there. I don't know. I'm trying to be as brutally honest and like not live in denial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: How does he feel about your staying there and then you're seeing somebody else? Does he not care?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, he does. Like I don't know. Maybe he's living in denial, too. But like he feels like I helped him when he was doing his thesis so now I feel like I guess he feels like he should I guess he's returning the favor. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So he doesn't have any romantic aspirations anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: He does. And I do too, actually. Like I'm not to be brutally honest. I don't have like I feel, I think about him when I'm at [Nelson] (ph) place like compare the two in the back of my head and I think about oh Chris is changing. He's becoming more social. If he's becoming more social and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">he's hanging out with these people then maybe he's becoming less judgmental about them now. Like at the event he commented about one of my old friends he just went up and hugged her. He said, 'I don't hug people but I just felt like hugging you. I haven't seen you in a while.' So that was unusual <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">and I don't know. I really miss talking to him so like during the week when I do see him for a little bit. We don't really see each other that much because he's always at work and he comes back to the apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. We don't see each other that much. We're like roommates too. But then yeah, the romantic aspirations are I still love him. I'd do anything for him. I feel like that bitterness is going away little by little and like it was all poison, you know. Like two years ago all that was poison <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">from my perception, you know? So I feel like that's going away. I wasn't concretely thinking about this but just feeling like it's all like in a new context part time. But that kind of feel maybe I'm just justifying it but I feel like it's making me think about things differently like value a bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">more in a way. Like when Chris and I talk it feels like so much fun now because I guess it's more as friends who know each other really well. There is not that many mundane conversations like you do this and I'll do that or we'll meet here or there's none of that and there are not that many expectations. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200753\">It's mostly 'how are you doing?' And then we talk about interesting things about people, about stuff, politics. Which was early in our relationship as well but then there was all that nastiness that was there too. I do feel I if I allow myself to feel, I would feel horribly guilty about seeing both <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200754\">people like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: How do you allow yourself not to feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I don't think about it. Like, I don't know. I'm trying. It's not working right now. Maybe some things will change and then I'll have the power to change with it like the power to choose, the power to let one person go, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: I don't know which one though. I don't know. I feel like while I'm confused I should be confused at my place you know?

I feel like that's one way of looking at it. I don't know how your perspective is on this but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: Can you say more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Some more about the -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: More about the idea of giving something up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, once I start getting something from someone, I can't give it up. Like I've been getting something from Chris for a very long time now, you know? Intellectual stimulation and growth and companionship and the lived life together and like long term expectations of spending our life together <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">and that's in the background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: But you don't really want that otherwise you'd be with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: I know, but it's there, right? It's like the sky is blue and it's like you may not expect every single day to wake up and it's blue but it's like it has been blue and you depend on it, you know? You don't actively want it, but and many days you may ignore it, but it's there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you should give him up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: No. And now I'm starting to get things from [Nelson] (ph) but it's still at a point where I can walk away and be sad for a few days, maybe a month, maybe a few months, but it's not at the same scale as the sky is blue. Like he is supportive of me and we do talk and like never I don't want <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">to make a (Unclear) here, but I feel like Chris is not as supportive. He is supportive and we do talk but it isn't like this. I haven't even thought about how it's different. Like earlier I don't think he was interested in any of this, like me going on and on about my feelings and stuff. I've said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">in here before, haven't I? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">I don't know if that translates into he's not emotionally supportive but I'm feeling that's accurate. I feel like that's an objective statement. But that he is becoming that now? I don't know. (Pause) I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think he says anything that relates. He's just there in his <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">quiet way, you know? And [Nelson] (ph) is different, he listens and then he gives feedback and he really talks for hours and makes me talk for hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Does he know that you live with Chris?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: No. No, he does not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: My concern for you, [Cecelia] (ph) is that in the end you'll end up with nothing in your quest to have everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. Yeah, I know that. I know it's a risk. But it's not really living with Chris as you think that it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Because I go there to work. Yeah, we're like roommates. But yeah. Why do you say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Because I think it's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Because I think that relationships don't always withstand you know, sort of denials and part truths. I don't think relationships, you know that which does damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know that in the back of my head but I feel like one solution is to break up with someone, end things with him. I don't know how it got this far. But I guess it got this far because I started getting something from him, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Well that would sort of be an external solution, but probably temporary because you needed to seek him out to begin with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So it still doesn't' address what's going on emotionally for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560578\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: What didn't address?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: If you broke up with him it still wouldn't address it it wouldn't be like all you ever wanted was Chris and you have eyes for no other man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know that. I think my problem is not that I don't know stuff. It's that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It's that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I don't have the power to like take control and do things based on all that knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Well it seems like you're always aware of what you're doing without like what's missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm focusing on that. I'm trying to be less that way. It's going to be hard to change since it's been years and years of thinking that way but I'm trying. I had a conversation with a friend and he was talking about his own experience and like he almost got married to this girl who <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">was very negative and said something very pointedly negative about the wedding and that really hurt his mom so that she caused like she really stressed that they not marry and they didn't and then he was telling me, 'every like finding fault and lack in everything,' and I was like 'I've been that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB2\">way like with Chris for a while. Not like for the whole, whole time. I was actually very happy with him and didn't have eyes for anyone. Like Graham came all the way from New York and he was like begging for a kiss, you know? Like he did everything right like after my breakdown I would fall for. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB3\">was doing everything at that time. He took me out dancing, I was like a little drunk but I did not. I had no one else in my head except Chris. But after the breakdown things changed and I became kind of addicted to seduction, you know? So after that I was looking at a lack I Chris but I'm pretty sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB4\">I'm kind of still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">(PAUSE): [00:36:55 00:27:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I feel like this time I will know for sure but I do want to like not live for Chris.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">[00:37:17 00:37:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: And I think [Nelson] (ph) has an inkling. He doesn't ask questions and like he said in a similar context earlier, he said I'm giving you time to sort things out. I know you've got something going on but I'm giving you time to sort things out. So he's like not really like he's not proposing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">and he's not like he's like, 'you have doubts. I know you have doubts.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: What do you mean, 'he's not proposing?'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: He's not like proposing marriage or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Is that a thought in your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Well, like you know, like the future, yeah. Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It seemed like it came out of left field for me<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. No I'm just saying it is in the left field. It's just I'm saying it's not I guess I'm trying to present his position without his actually being here, so it's like he knows that I have a lot going on, I have a lot to figure out and that's what he tells me when we talk 'you've got <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">things to figure out and I'm just giving you time.' He's we only make plans for so far ahead and it's like on a week to week basis and it's not like we haven't bought tickets to go on a mini-break or anything like that. We haven't done anything like that. But it does make me feel ridiculous when I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF2\">like I could save that money and move back in with Chris and creativity and sex are related not that I only get sex from [Nelson] (ph). We don't even have proper sex, but like if I move back with Chris I can do all the creative things I'm doing and do them with more passion and then like when we do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF3\">have sex or whatever I'll try and be happy with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560578\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">I don't know if I can make that maybe it's ludicrous of me to think that.
