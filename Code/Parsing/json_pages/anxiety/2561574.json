One minute she thinks it is a good idea and then she doesn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t want to do it. And yesterday I was just like, \u201cWhat the?\u201d She was like, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t \u201c She was like, \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">getting by.

Unless they are fucking rich. Or even when they are rich. I mean, they just downsize and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">they simplify things. And you want to live in this fucking place but you also want to complain about money.\u201d It\u2019s like that\u2019s You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">So (sigh) it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know.

Again, I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve gone down to a downtown agency and put in an application? CLIENT: Yeah. My friend knows someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And taken all the tests and everything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t done tests.

Why, if they have a pile of people, why are they going to call the dude that is in his forties almost done with a PhD to staple papers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: That doesn\u2019t even make sense to me.

Or even the ones with jobs are holding on for dear life, you know, for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201251\">most part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: So what is the shocking part here?

You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">THERAPIST: So Brian (ph), when I am responding it is naively right now because I don\u2019t go home and see with you what you are doing. How many calls you make per week, how many applications you put in, how many of those jobs do you follow up and persist and say, \u201cI want an interview.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">Like that actually is what it takes to get a job, probably at any time.

I mean I do that with the jobs I really want.

Again -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">THERAPIST: And so even to get the paper stapling job you have to do that.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: But you do do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course?

So that then makes sense. Most people wouldn\u2019t find, necessarily find a job after a month or two. You might at a temp agency if you actually went and interviewed at the temp agency. But that is not that long yet. And maybe for the months before that you were applying to like jobs that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F1\">seemed really interesting. Like that is kind of where it started.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2018E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561574\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Uh. No. Actually, I\u2019ve always been applying to I kind of had the sense that I was fucked so I just started applying to anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause) You are saying you feel like you have done everything you can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Well, yes. But, again -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: What? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: I have a problem with that kind of paradigm. That is like Sisyphus. Like you are doing everything you can to get that boulder up there. Right? Forget about the fact that the boulder is just about to run you over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: It is like, yeah. (ph) (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: But if you are, then that is all you can do. Do you know what I mean? There is a difference between doing everything you can do and someone who actually isn\u2019t doing everything they can do. There is a big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But see my problem There is. But my problem always is, is that the onus is always on that person. Not the circumstances, not the context, how that person even got into that situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yes. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT: It is a given that you have got to do what you can to get a livelihood. I feel like those things are such givens. People like to just focus on the givens. It\u2019s like, of course you need some money to live your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: Which means you probably need a job. Which means you should probably bust your ass to get a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">CLIENT: We get all that. Let\u2019s put But there are bigger things going on that contribute to why you are even in that situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: Why you aren\u2019t getting a call back from places. So, you know, this my problem. I feel like people feel It\u2019s like anything else. Basically it is like anything else now in this country. If you\u2019re not rich you\u2019re doing something. Something is going on that you are not as rich as me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: Why am I rich and you are not? I worked hard, I didn\u2019t sleep, I fucking rubbed elbows, I did what I had to do to It\u2019s like, well people are doing the best they can. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: See I don\u2019t feel that way if you are doing what you can do. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: That is where it is different. Like I work with people who will be saying they are applying for jobs and it actually means they put in three applications to unrealistic jobs and they didn\u2019t follow up at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">THERAPIST: And they could say that for nine months on end and actually they are not really trying to apply for jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">THERAPIST: So what is going on that they are not really trying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">THERAPIST: That is what is important. It is very different than a person who is doing everything in their power and because times are tough it is impossible. That is actually not their responsibility. Right? They have to live with the consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Of course, those are yours. Like those are no one else\u2019s but yours. The consequences and the suffering in it. But it is not your responsibility if you are doing everything in your power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">THERAPIST: And then it is much more on the times and a limited number of jobs. So that is all. When I ask about it it is because I don\u2019t know and I sometimes could intuit, perhaps incorrectly, the way you talk about writing or some other things where you could sort of sit ambivalently about some things <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF1\">for a while -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561574\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: that I don\u2019t know if you actually have been pursuing or if it has felt like doing it part way but not the whole way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Like how dire is it, in a way? It is not that dire in a way if there is more you can do.

(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I guess, but I\u2019m saying is how could I have any job if I wasn\u2019t like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: Like obviously I get that that is how you have to be to get any job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well sometimes people fall into the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: It falls in their lap. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: And I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">CLIENT: [No job in my lap.] (ph) That has never happened. But I know what you are saying though. Or you go through phases where, yeah, other times maybe you are feeling better and you do work harder to get a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">CLIENT: And then other times you\u2019re just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FB\">THERAPIST: Totally. You are motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">CLIENT: depressed and you don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Even tailoring a resume. Sometimes that can make a difference -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">THERAPIST: because you have really worked on this resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">CLIENT: Well that is why I said, I have got three resumes, well two really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20209\">CLIENT: But, you know, I took the PhD things off.

So if you have done all that, Brian (ph), then it is feeling I mean that makes sense that it feels like you are doing what you can do. Like actually <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I guess I haven\u2019t said that in here because I just assumed that that was assumed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">CLIENT: But, yeah, yeah. Well that is probably because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20213\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t assume it because in so many other areas of your life that is not the way you describe it being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20215\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. THERAPIST: But it is helpful to me to know that when it comes down to money it feels like that is not the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20217\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. With jobs that is never Because jobs are very black and white to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20219\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021B\">CLIENT: There\u2019s no What\u2019s the It is not art.

It is just a job. I mean it is very black and white. You know? Almost like the house thing. In a different that is pretty black and white too. I\u2019m not ambivalent about shit. I am proactive about I want to get this thing done, you know, somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20221\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20223\">CLIENT: Jobs are the same way.

Like could there be there be layers of things that are about <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202711\">something else rather than actually about the reality of applying for a job (cross talking at 00:29:02).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20270-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20270-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561574\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20273\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. well I am sure there is.

Right? So there you are with all these twenty somethings. Or even more depressing, older people. Do you know what I mean? I mean it is just sitting in that fucking room. We are all pretending that we are kind of eager to fucking staple somebody\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202831\">paper for a week somewhere. That is some seriously psychologically fucked up. I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20285\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20287\">CLIENT: But to me it is.

So, \u201cI will do this thing. And I buh, buh, buh, buh. And I can staple the papers.

Something doesn\u2019t feel right in society,\u201d or something. There is already that feeling. Two, it is not what it used to be. I have got a million temp agencies. Before it did feel a little more lighter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AD\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202AF\">CLIENT: It did feel that way. It doesn\u2019t feel that way now to me. I feel like it is there is desperation in the air. And, you know, for some people this is their job. This is all they have been able to do for months and months or whatever it is. So that thing is gone of like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll just temp for <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202AF1\">a few weeks and then something will turn up.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202B3\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t feel that.

I wish I didn\u2019t, of course. I wish I was just had my black briefcase and, you know. That is great. I love that. (laughs) But I am not like that. So to me I walk in and everybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202C71\">has a story.
