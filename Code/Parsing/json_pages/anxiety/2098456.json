(pause) (sighs) A lot to talk about. (pause) So, I'm glad I'm here. Because I had a I had a cold all week, (pause) that somehow turned into a toothache last night. So, I only got like three hours of sleep. So, I think it's much better now, but I don't know if it was because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">I floss three or four times a day.  So, I don't know if I over did it or something, or it's just a cold, or just I don't know what the fuck, anyway. But anyway, that's not the important part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">So, (pause) something happened on Friday, that if this was This is how I know this shit's working. That if this was if it had happened even like six months ago or a year ago, I would have just fucking spiraled. So, basically the long and short of it is, I hit a rock bottom thing when it comes to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">my student loans and my financial, you know. And how did that happen. I I don't know how it crossed my mind, but a month or two ago, (pause) I don't know how I remembered someone talking about There's this site where you go and you see if the state has any money owed to you. Like accounts you've <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">forgotten or shit like that.  So, I don't know why, but on a whim I went on there, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: To see if the state owed you (inaudible at )?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: (Overlapping voices) Yeah, there's a site that when people that forget they have some savings account from ten years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Oh, yes. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Just random things. I go on there. I found out that I had a savings account and I have like $2,500 owed that's in that savings account, (pause) from the old bank, or whatever. I get really excited. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? That would I get pretty excited. Whatever, I do the paper <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">work. I check it out and there's all this paperwork, whatever, I send in. I get the check Friday. The check's for 300 bucks. (pause) Why? Because the money was intercepted by one of these collection assholes for student loans, and they took everything but 300 bucks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(pause) Now, like I said, if that was six months ago, I would have lost my fucking shit. And I still do. I mean, it's that's ridiculous. I mean, I was so happy because I have no money basically. That would have been a nice cushion to, you know what I mean? But you know what? I almost immediately was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">like; well yeah I mean of course they did because I don't take care of these things. And all I had to do was call who ever I owe money to and just work it out, and I didn't. So, this is shitty. I don't think they should be allowed to do that, but that's the way it goes. (pause) So, in a weird way, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">feel good about that (laughing) reaction. Especially having a cold, Thanksgiving was boring as fuck, and I didn't give a shit. It was not I was a very blah week.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So, it was the kick in the balls. It was like, you know what dude? Monday you're going to call all these people. (pause) Sallie Mae, Shmallie (ph) Mae, or whatever the name of it. Listen man. I'm doing (inaudible at ). I don't know what to do. What can we do to That's it. That's all I had to do for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">the last number of years. (pause) The other thing though with that that it did do, is it got me writing. Because like (pause) Yes of course it's my fault for not calling these but, I've the last number more and more and more. I just believe there's a systemic fucking problem here with education, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">loans. (pause) It just it ties into my whole anger about not just no guidance from my family, but the minute you're fucking 18 they're just throwing credit cards at you. There's no they don't teach you shit in high school about finances.  That really makes me angry. That's not my fault. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098456\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">I wanted to get an education. And I'm sorry that I don't want to be a lawyer or an engineer or something. I really believe that's predatory bullshit. Don't make it that easy to Don't give Ph.D.'s in English Lit if you're not going to give people secure jobs, and you know what I mean? Figure it out. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">Either don't make them pay, or if you're going to screw people financially, make sure that there's some jobs after they get these degrees that later you're going to mock (ph) them for. That, I don't know, it just got me really, really angry. So, because on the one hand its, yeah, of course I could have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">nipped this in the bud, but that wouldn't negate the fact of how much I owe, which is insane.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You're saying you feel they should they shouldn't have accepted you as a student?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: No, what I'm saying is there is a systemic problem. Not just with student loans, but in general, debt in this country is just out of People have no savings.  Average people have no savings. Why not? Because you're constantly being pushed to be in debt. One way or the other you're It's bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">if you don't have a credit history If you don't credit history. That's insanity. You know what I mean? It's bad if you have credit cards but you pay all of them off all the time. That's bad for your credit score. You should have you should pay off almost everything, but have a 10 percent amount <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">that you keep rolling. I just feel like these are really sinister ways to just fuck average people, and ways to keep poor people poor. By making them want shit and then taking on debt that they then can't pay, and then blaming. It's always blaming weak people. Well you shouldn't have done that. Why <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">did you go get a fucking Ph.D. in English? (inaudible at ) Do something that makes money. Or, why'd you by a big screen TV?  Who told you to buy Well, (pause) it doesn't work that way. Yeah, people should be responsible, but (pause) when someone's life is kind of miserable, all they want is a fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">and they're being pushed from every direction to want things. It's like; they want a fucking big screen TV. That's They're not the one I'm going to blame. I'm going to blame the assholes that are crapping on them day in and day out. You know what I mean? I just I mean, I'm not trying to over simplify <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200215\">it, but I just believe there is something systemically not balanced here. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">So, anyway. (pause) So that got me writing. Just to write about, like, there has to be a better way to do this. I mean, I think education should be free. But even if it's not free, there's got to be a way to (pause) balance the discrepancy between a shit load of people who want these fine arts degrees, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">or whatever degrees, and the mockery that it is once they're done.  That doesn't make sense to me. I don't understand how that makes sense. You know what I mean? Either don't give those degrees, or give like one at every university (laughing). Or give the fucking degrees and make sure that people have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">jobs. Don't make them adjunct slaves, or whatever. I don't know.

So, that's Harvard? They could they could make everyone tenure tomorrow and they'd have billions of dollars in their endowment. You know what I mean? It's about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">are you a corporation or are you about knowledge? If you're about knowledge, it doesn't make Why are you giving all these Ph.D.'s if then there are no jobs for those I mean, make jobs.  But don't hire adjuncts, just fucking hire these people as tenure track professors. Or at least as full time lecturers <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">with benefits. You know what I mean? It doesn't I don't understand that. Basically universities are saying we'll give you a Ph.D. in Nigerian folk songs, but we're running this thing like a corporation. So, what that doesn't make sense. If a place like Harvard is doing that, imagine Ball State University <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200273\">or what I mean, it's a joke. So, (pause) I don't know. But it's a general thing I'm talking not just that. I just In high school they teach you a million things but sit you down and say \"Listen man, (pause) we're not trying to scare you (laughs), but we are trying to scare you. Finances are really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200274\">fucking important. It'll haunt you for years, and it's really difficult to \" I just don't understand why that's not a class. I don't know. Anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Anyway. (pause) So I'm just glad it didn't completely derail me.

Yeah, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) that they can both be there. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: (overlapping voices) There's a context in which you make bad decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: You know what I mean? So, I get that I'm angry at the context, but my bad decision a bad or no decision. When you're not proactive about something, you're not being proactive about something. That's all there is to it. So, no absolutely. That's why yeah, I think that's why I'm not that upset. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\"> That's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah that's what feels really different.

And it wasn't that I wasn't I mean, I had my first <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201531\">real job that at that carpet store. I worked hard and I liked that job. So I Maybe because that was such a small business, and I felt like it was more of a family or something. I don't know what it was, but these other places that are bigger and just random people and everything, I think You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201532\">what I think the other thing is too?
