There's a bunch of people waiting in there. So I have an office now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: It's official?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It's official.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Thank you. Yeah, it's crazy, man. So it's really cool. I was relieved, because I was going to meet the woman, the real in-charge woman. Her name's Eva? I don't know if you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I know the name sounds familiar. I don't know her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I was like, I hope... the woman I met was cool. (Chuckling) I was like, I hope this woman's cool. She was awesome. We had such a great conversation. And she was like, I'm so happy. Laney (sp?) spoke very highly of you. And she's like, we try to be really picky about who we have here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">because, she's like, everyone loves it here. [0:00:56] So we really try to make sure it's someone who's going to... I don't know. She was really great, a really cool person. And I just felt immediately right, just felt really good. And... yeah. So it's crazy, yeah. So then I was thinking about it. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">I was like, all right, so I'm excited. I was like, I think the two main things that are happening now are... two of the main things are that I've got to fight through or manage some of the hypochondria that comes up or existential-type hypochondria that comes up (chuckling) when I'm trying to do something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">A. And B is, I do feel a little... and I think that's just going to happen no matter what I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I think I have to now accept that, no matter what kind of job I have, always feel this kind of, but you're not being a real artist. [0:02:04] You're not... what do you do? So now you're doing this other thing. Are you a writer? Are you a musician? Now you're starting this business. What...? So that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">means you're not really a true artist. You're... and I know that's completely an antiquated definition of what an artist is (chuckling). But I can't help it. It's a kind of... I do feel it. I'd feel like [that's kind of] (ph)... so I almost feel like the system won. I couldn't... I just couldn't suck <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">it up and find another...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, suck it up and what, though? Starve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: That's the thing. Yeah, that's the thing. Those days... I know. This isn't 1952. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But even then, when you say those days, people had to somehow make money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: No, I do think there's a difference. I think there was a time, not that long ago, where you could... you would not be living comfortably at all. [0:03:01] But there were ways. You could... and I don't even mean in a romanticized way. I mean, it was just shitty. But it could be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: How? [What do you mean, that they could have a job where they make money] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I just think... I think that either they would get jobs (pause) that could kind of get them through enough. See, the problem now is that... for example, let's say working somewhere a few hours a week. That's not enough anymore. I think the dollar... the power of a dollar... you know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">Things have changed. Also I think there was less competition to some extent back in the day. And also there was more of a bohemian... a true bohemian way of life where people crashed somewhere. [0:03:56] They lived in bookstores, for Christ's sake. That's... who's going to live in a bookstore? That's... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">but those things did happen, you know what I mean? Real things happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560562\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does sound very romanticized, though (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don't think... I mean, I don't think it's... I think it's shitty. But I'm just saying there were ways to... people would just somehow jump on an ocean liner and make it to Europe and somehow they'd be a reporter (chuckling) during the Spanish Civil War. They were able to make some kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">living as a... you can't just do that now. I'm not saying that that's.... that's pretty shitty. I'm just saying that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Maybe that's that piece, picking up a side job is not very easy these days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: There was just... yeah, there was just a way to just exist. I'm not saying it was a great existence. But there was a way to just somehow exist outside a kind of systematized... now there... I don't see a way. If you're going to live in the west, I don't see... you have to plug in directly. [0:04:57] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">Not... you can't be on the outside somewhere unless you really are going to live in Wisconsin and chop your own wood and build a cabin. You have to be part of some kind of mainstream, kind of conventional way of life to make any kind of decent living. (Pause) I don't think that part's that... I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">I think I can handle that, because this is my own business. So... (Pause) But it is there, that piece is kind of there. Or at least that piece is there where it's like, okay, now you can't make excuses anymore. You can't say, I work for a shitty boss. I don't like my job, I don't like my schedule, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F3\">don't like this. So now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: It's on (ph) you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I think the first piece is the more important piece. I think that's the one that can get me down and get me all... this kind of... what we were talking about yesterday. [0:06:00] It's like this existential... there's hypochondria thrown in. There's... especially right now. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">everyone around me's kind of ill or something. So that doesn't help, but... (Pause) And that's a tough one, because like we said, I mean, there's no... that's never going to go away. I mean, people get sick, and we all get old. So I don't... (Pause) So I don't know. I think the answer is that the more... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">if I was producing... if I get more into that head space of just working on my books and [I see] (ph) production, that's... I think that's the way to deal with that. (Pause) [0:06:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Making the most of every day you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, and seeing some kind of... yeah, I mean, just a product. Seeing that you're channeling that stuff, and then here's something you've made with all that stuff that you channeled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Even focusing on the product though can sometimes get overwhelming. I think each day, do you feel, at the end of the day, good about how you spent that day? Do you feel proud about (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. I don't mean proud of the actual book in the store. I just mean, every day, oh shit, I wrote 20 pages today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, (crosstalk) product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and being into the process. Like, wow, man. Every day I'm, wow. Here's some poems. Here's a chunk of the novel. Here's this, here's that. Or with music or whatever. Just feeling like, all right, I'm (pause) doing...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560562\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Living your life. Living...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. Instead of being caught up here, yeah. [0:07:56] That really is the hardest piece, I'm realizing. And it's not going to get easier, because this is what happens. Your friends get older, you get older, people start having aches and pains and illness things, or their family members do, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">their spouses do, or their whatever they do. It's just... or you... grandmother, mom, whatever. So, just that's a tough one. If you've had years and years and years of living in terror and intense anxiety and stuff, it's like... (Pause) The other thing that was cool about yesterday, talking to Eva, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">was again I felt totally there. You know what I mean? [0:08:54] I didn't feel intimidated. I didn't feel weird. I didn't feel... I wasn't so self-conscious of what I was saying or how I was sitting or how... I felt very articulate and focused and... (Pause) And I was very... I liked how I was very honest <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">I articulated certain things that... (Pause) I was like, oh, well, that's good, I'm glad... I was saying things like, I've... I was like, I feel a certain... I don't know how I said it exactly. But I basically was saying, it was important to me to be somewhere where I'm not going to feel weird being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">the life coach. I don't know how certain therapists look at that or not or whatever. And I was like, I didn't want to be somewhere where I'm kind of looked down on or kind of feel like the outsider or feel... because otherwise what's the point of renting a... and she was like, no, not at all. We're... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">she's like... oh, that's when she said... she's like, first of all, we're very picky about who we allow to rent here. [0:10:01] So she's like, right there, that should tell you something. But she's like, also... they all do psychodynamic therapy? I don't know how that's different from psychoanalysis, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: They're the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: [I mean] (ph), psychodynamic and psychoanalytic are interchangeable. Psychodynamic psychotherapy means kind of doing this more like once a week or twice a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Psychodynamic is more like... oh, so that's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It's more just a matter of frequency. Psychoanalysis is more like three, four, five times a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: More often. Oh, okay. So that's what I've been doing this whole time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yes. Even when we were once a week it was psychodynamic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Okay. So yeah, she was like, that's what we do here. So we kind of understand... I don't know. She was just saying, we get it, that piece, that there are people that... they don't need mental health therapy anymore. They need some other piece. And also she was funny. She was like, and also... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">she's like, trust me. We've all thought about life coaching. [0:10:55] She's like, I mean, there's an overlap whether you want there to be or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: She's like, there's no way around that. So she's like, I've had... she said... she told me a funny story. She had a patient who was so skeptical about seeing a therapist that they just started calling it life coaching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Because she was like, I think maybe I should just see a life... she was trying... it was a denial, defensive thing. She was like, maybe I should just see a life coach. That's what I need. So she was like, it's... but anyway... so that felt really good. It was a very... I just felt very comfortable. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">And she just... she was just so genuine and nice and... yeah, that's just great. Yeah, and she knows of you, too. She's like, yeah, we... she's like, I know about Claire (sp?), and it's a similar type of approach. And... see, I told her that, too. I was like, I kind of like that when I come here, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">kind of feel like the way I feel when I go to see Claire. [0:11:57] And I said, not just as a patient. That's... I mean, when I just go to her office, I feel good. It's clean and nice, and there's something pleasant about it. And I said, people are trying to better themselves. They don't want to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D3\">to some hippy dippy shack in wherever, Shrewsbury, whatever. And so that... she was like, believe me, I get that. She's like, I've done... I've had kind of more corporate-type offices. And I've had to... have sometimes that kind of shabby, frumpy Baltimore. And she's like, neither of those things work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D4\">so... yeah, so it's cool. It's like, she totally... I don't know. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560562\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You're describing a feeling (inaudible at 0:12:45) and feeling mutuality and fitting in (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel... yeah, and I think that comes from me, not... she's being herself. [0:12:59] But I don't have to feel like, well, these are all PhDs and therapists. So I'm just... I don't feel that way. I'm doing something different. And it's not my fault that it's not regulated and I don't need <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">a fucking credential. Deal with it. It's not my fucking problem. I know that... and I even told her, I was... because she asked me about... and that was the thing. She was really cool about that. She didn't make me feel weird. And I just told her honestly, I was like, I'm getting my... I'm in the process <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200612\">of thinking about how I'm going to do the credentialing thing. And I was like, I'm just skeptical, because I was like, if it's not regulated, then in a way why should I be spending $7,000, $10,000 for things that I... everybody and their brother can have a coaching school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">I don't... yeah, there's an international thing, but I don't know. I was like, I'm just skeptical of that. I feel like, if I'm going to do that, why don't I just do what I've been doing all these years and just get one more fucking master's degree? [0:13:57] And that's that. And I said... because we <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">talked a lot. I talked about my background. And I was like, it's something I'm really interested in, I've always been interested in. It fed into my PhD research and reading, and so why not do the real thing that I'm actually really interested in, rather than this kind of coaching school that I'm not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">quite certain about? But yeah, so I didn't feel... I just felt like, hey, I'm doing this thing. And everyone's different. We're not... (Pause) So... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: It's so not what you felt as a kid.

I think it's just going to take... I don't know how long these things take generally. [0:14:56] But I think that's what it is. I feel really good, but then I have moments where I'm thinking about how good I... <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">not in a bad way. But I'm just like... I just... it really is like you just got out of a coma. And I'm like, whoa. (Chuckling) I don't know how to explain it. You know what I mean? It's almost like you're tingly or you're like, wow. You're... yeah, that's the only way I can explain it. It's like you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">just wake up from a long slumber. So everything's vibrant and colors.

Then you're just going to get used to this, your life being <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">good or normal or just being what it is. And then what? So that's what I'm saying.

I don't think you'd be as preoccupied with [the end] (ph) if you felt more loveable and loved, [in love with yourself] (ph) truly, from the beginning. [0:18:03] And I think that is something that can change. I don't think it means... it's not only just people who are <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">dense and don't think about the meaning of life that aren't concerned with that. I think actually it can be something that's like, it's a fleeting thought. But it's not preoccupying anymore when you get to be more in the joy of the current moment and just having... and feeling good about now, that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200892\">think has not been there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And still... it's starting a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's there a lot more now.

Is that really what he said, though? You think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: What he says is complicated, obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

He's like, Nietzsche... he's like, of course I love Nietzsche, whatever, I like a lot of his ideas. But he's like, he had the whole eternal return thing completely wrong. He's like, he wants that to be the case. He's like, that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">a deep... he kind of psychologized it. He's like, that's someone who wants to... because he doesn't want to let go of these... his life basically, so that, oh, well, it just happens again (chuckling). [0:20:03] It just happens over and over again. He's like, no it doesn't. So those particulars are particulars. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A32\">They're... and then other particulars take their place. (Pause) But then it's weird because he had the whole thing about active forgetting. So there's kind of a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, he had troubles.

(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I mean, I know it's another theory, but there are ways that the theories of the existentialists are... from this perspective people who actually were haunted as children by the meaningless of their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, when you look at their backgrounds, yeah, of course.

They were like, so you're either going to kill yourself or you're not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: But I know what you mean. Their level of... because, I mean, that's not that difficult of a conclusion. I don't need to write ten books to get to the point of... I don't need to write Being and Nothingness to realize you either kill yourself or you don't (laughing). But yeah. It's like, once <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">you get... once you realize that that's what there is, then you're clearly not going to do one of those things. [0:21:54] So why not make the most of your life and... which is, again, kind of what they said. They were like, all you can do in life is act. But yeah, you've got to take out the kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF2\">nihilistic part, or just know that, yeah, that's there. But... I mean, and? So what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: The fact that most humans don't kill themselves, so why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Right, that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: A lot of people ask this question, and they decide not to kill themselves (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Because they have a death drive or death... right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It's like... so, if you're going to live it, what are you going to do with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: That's actually a good point.

Yeah, it is about coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">to a place of... it's not going to make you happy, but just to a place of contentment with what is, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Or, if you're going to choose to live this day, what do you want to do with the day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Right.

And they didn't have yet the equipment or language to deal with understanding what trauma was, what PTSD was, why people identify with the aggressor and become fighters and kill people.

It's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah. There's a guy in that documentary, who wrote a bio of Foucault, says, one of the things about Foucault is he acted out all these things that he wrote about.

[0:27:04] (Pause) I think the other thing that will be good, too, is... as I get more <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">together, is I think travel, you know what I mean?

I just find that... because I think what happens with me is, when (ph) I'm from here and I do get into... I like my routines? And that's a wonderful thing. But I think that's only wonderful if you can get away from <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201431\">it and come back to it, to be like, oh, back to my Dunkin Donuts, like I felt when I got back from the UK. It felt so good to be back. And it's still... I mean, I'm still... I'm happy I'm here. But I think there's something to be said for... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Routine can become a rut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: Especially when you're an artist. For me traveling is never one of those all-inclusive beach resort... travel is always, I'm writing, I'm thinking about things and taking mental notes, and so I think it's important. [0:28:57] As a matter of fact that's the first... I'm not a big person, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">I'm going to reward myself with this or that? But I've already decided that, when my credit score gets to the next level...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Mm-hmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: And if I get a credit card or whatever with a real... an actual... (chuckling) over $1000 or $2000 or $3000 or whatever, then I think I am going to treat myself. I don't know, go to Iceland or something like that. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: Something to look forward to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm psyched. (Pause) Yeah, or I need to... I think I need to apply... I'm getting back to now writer's residencies, visiting professor. I need to... I haven't done one of those things, not... well, I was going to do one years ago that I decided not to do (laughing). [0:29:59] But it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201531\">time to... even those would be huge re-energizers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Abroad, you mean, or (crosstalk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: Doesn't even matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">CLIENT: I don't even care if it's the Provincetown writers' colony. There's something... I think I need to start... it's not just the, every day writing five pages. I need to feel like, all right. I am living a writer's...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2015A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560562\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:30:24)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It would be like doing all this music and then never doing a show, not actually making... just recording it and leaving it somewhere. That's kind of what I'm doing with my writing. I'm not... I don't do readings. I don't get involved. And that's fine. (Chuckling) I don't really want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F1\">do that shit. But I do want to do more formal... a colony or a college or whatever the fuck. I think that's important...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: Because then, okay, I am a writer. And this is what writers do. [0:30:57] You're meeting new people, you're changing your environment, your... (Pause) And everybody needs validation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: At some point you need to know that, okay. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: How's your book (inaudible at 0:31:26) of poems coming?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: Good. That... I think I might shift... I think it's time for that to be done. I have more than enough pages, manuscript pages, more than enough. But it's not... I think I'm going to scrap a lot of it or something. But yeah, it's... I mean, I have the title, I have the working themes. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B1\">what this book is about. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: So you're close then. [0:32:00] It's editing. No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: No, because I think, as I edit, I'm going to be like, eh (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: Because there are only a few poems in there that I feel reflect right now, you know what I mean? I feel like I've already outgrown... or I'm going to take them and rewrite around them, you know what I mean? This bit is nice, this bit is nice, and now here's a whole new something around it. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201731\">yeah, it's got to get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: You think that before your novel then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: For sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah. This novel's going to be big. It's not going to be a little novel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I figured as much, but (crosstalk) poems for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's going to be big. And also you figure, even if I... let's say I had three really good chapters done. Well, then you're still talking about... it's not like poetry. You've got to find an agent, and you've got to shop the book around if you're lucky and... it's a much longer process. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F1\">[0:33:02] So yeah. (Pause) See, it happens again. You see that? I'm thinking... instead of now just thinking, yeah, it's cool (ph), the minute I stopped, that voice comes up. It's like, yeah, but so what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">THERAPIST: So what? So what, about publishing the poems?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">CLIENT: Just all of it, does any of that matter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">CLIENT: Yeah, it sucks, man. I mean, I ignore it, and I move on. But it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">THERAPIST: It's mean to you, that voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: These are things that are really important to you, you're talented at. Why would that be so (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. [0:33:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: It's like the kid playing the piano [and someone yelling] (ph), shut up. (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: Exactly. Or saying, so how many pages is this book (chuckling)? Just publish the book. How many pages is it? Yeah. Yep. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">THERAPIST: That's a moment as a kid when your heart breaks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, and that's what happens when that voice comes up. It's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: Your heart hurts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it breaks your own heart, you know what I mean? It's like, ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">CLIENT: I don't know, I mean, the thing that... luckily it's gotten so much better that that makes me feel better, at least to be like, all right, yes, that voice is there. But when I leave here I'm going to go back to the coffee shop or to some caf , and I'm going to try to get some pages done. [0:34:56] <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F1\">So that's real major improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2019E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560562\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Even that you're able to recognize it right now sort of in the moment, that's huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I've gotten really good at... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">THERAPIST: That you can hear it now, so to be... rather than taking it as fact immediately...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Maybe be interested in, wow, why is that voice so loud right now? Or... because it actually doesn't make sense that it doesn't matter.

They're the ones who are right, because it doesn't really matter. That's a sort of borrowing from them because they're in agreement with your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">CLIENT: Right. I see what you're saying, yeah.
