I\u2019ve got two different kinds of letters. A week or two ago, I got a letter saying, \u201cYour unemployment\u2019s running. You\u2019re eligible for extension.\u201d I did that, then I got a letter saying, \u201cYep, you\u2019re qualified. This is what you\u2019ll get for 14 weeks.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">Yesterday, I get a letter saying, \u201cNope!\u201d I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s a \u201cNo.\u201d I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anymore, what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a letter saying, \u201cThese fucking assholes didn\u2019t renew the extensions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So I guess I was qualified and they said, \u201cYes,\u201d but at the very same moment, it was denied for the new year in the budget. I think that this week will be my last week. I think; I don\u2019t fucking know. I still don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And of course, it\u2019s Christmas, so good luck getting ahold of anybody to talk to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Which is perfect, because I spent the whole Christmas\u2014we do Christmas Eve. Went great, no political discussions, nothing like that. I made a huge mistake to go on Christmas Day back to my cousins \u2013 because they had leftovers, there was nothing to do. Something told me not to go. It\u2019s so weird, something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">told me not go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">I go and everything was great, but at the dinner table, fucking (inaudible at 00:01:30) comes up \u2013 because their last day is Sunday, because they\u2019re getting shafted. They were like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s sad that that\u2019s happening.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I was like, \u201cWell, I mean, but that\u2019s the Square. It\u2019s a completely\u2026 it\u2019s the epitome of the immorality of how our system works, now. It is sad, but you know what? We can say it\u2019s sad all we want, it just doesn\u2019t fucking matter. Are we going to do anything about it? Nope!  Nobody cares. I have $100 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">million. I\u2019m going to buy this block cash. Done. You want to pay me 50% more rent? Great. If you don\u2019t, how is that my problem? That\u2019s why you have all these empty\u2014WordsWorth has been empty for fucking eight years now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And of course, then my uncle, \u201cWell, you know, but it is also kind of just the way it is.\u201d They can\u2019t just focus on, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just really shitty.\u201d They say that, but then it\u2019s like, \u201cBut I mean, that\u2019s just the way\u2026\u201d I have a short fuse, I have a short fuse, and I just let him have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I was like, \u201cWhat does that mean? This is the problem in this country. This is a morality issue, it\u2019s a moral issue. No one has the balls\u2014I don\u2019t give a shit what\u2014\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201c40% of people are on welfare.\u201d First of all, that\u2019s a personal\u2026  It\u2019s like, \u201cDude, your nephew is on unemployment!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">It was bad. I didn\u2019t feel good. Then I didn\u2019t feel good because I don\u2019t feel good. My mind started like, \u201cThis is what happens. This is why your dad died, because he got so stressed. He was unemployed. He just got crushed by the system.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat the fuck are you saying, man? What does that mean? Why are you so upset about weak people that are getting $200 a week? And you\u2019re not outraged by the billions of dollars that people are hoarding and fucking\u2014that\u2019s somehow doesn\u2019t outrage you? That\u2019s a moral issue!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">My mom got upset, she\u2019s like, \u201cBe quiet!\u201d (laughs) It was bad. It was fine, we didn\u2019t have a blowout, but I was very upset.

It\u2019s like, you know what? I don\u2019t know what to say anymore. I don\u2019t believe in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">fate or whatever.

It\u2019s not directed towards me, but it\u2019s like, \u201cWow, really? That\u2019s some cold shit. It\u2019s fucking Christmas, man. That\u2019s\u2026 Wow.\u201d I don\u2019t even have fucking children.  There are people with children and whatever responsibilities. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">It\u2019s that feeling you get right after you have a political (inaudible at 00:05:16).

It was fine, we didn\u2019t have a big blowout, but I felt\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What are you (inaudible at 00:05:26)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t like that rattled feeling. They\u2019re not really rattled. They were like, \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d and, \u201cWell, what system should it be? Communism? That didn\u2019t work.\u201d They\u2019re so fucking robotic about it. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m very visceral and very emotional about it. I don\u2019t like that feeling. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">A.) It\u2019s a complete waste of breath; there\u2019s no point, sitting at a dinner table \u2013 who the fuck cares? But, at the same time, it\u2019s hurtful that people can\u2019t\u2014I mean, I guess I shouldn\u2019t say, \u201cPeople.\u201d I think most people at the dinner table actually did get what I was saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">But my uncle is now such the arbiter of\u2014it\u2019s like people are\u2014they can\u2019t\u2014he\u2019s the wielder of wealth and power. He\u2019s the one who can help you when you really need.

It\u2019s also so simplistic that that\u2019s\u2014yeah. Even now, I hate when I get worked up about it, but I just do. I just do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">I\u2019m sensitive about it. It bothers me that people can\u2019t see simple things.

But that\u2019s just the way it is, what are you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">going to do?\u201d Or women can\u2019t vote. Or you name it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">People decide that things are immoral, then they don\u2019t know what the answers are to fix that. They just know that this is immoral, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s even enough just to say it! I\u2019m not saying march down the street, waving the Communist Manifesto.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">That\u2019s what drives me crazy! Of course, I\u2019m not a communist! These things could actually be fixed really simply, that\u2019s the problem. But people get bogged down and like, \u201cWell, how are we going to do that?\u201d Well, you\u2019re going to do it by maybe taxing people just 1% more who make a lot of money. Cut <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">the military budget by even a fucking half a point of a person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">It\u2019s really not rocket science. If people decided this is immoral, then things would be fixed.  It\u2019s really quite simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">That was the thing. I felt rattled that I was being very articulate. (laughs) I was like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really a decision. You\u2019re making a decision. What you\u2019re saying is that\u2014\u201d People don\u2019t have the balls to either say this is a moral issue or the balls to say, \u201cYeah, you know what? I don\u2019t care. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">I don\u2019t care. It is a cutthroat system, but I like it. So yeah, (inaudible at 00:08:29) should just shut its doors.

Like, \u201cDude, your sister\u201d \u2013 my mom \u2013 \u201cher social security got cut. Basically, are you saying that in this market, then, she somehow didn\u2019t compete?\u201d If we\u2019re going to follow that logic, then tough for my mom; she should have worked harder and gotten a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">education and made more money. I guess I\u2019m just lazy that I lost this job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">That\u2019s really what it is, it\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d The end logic of that. \u201cIt\u2019s (inaudible at 00:09:42) fault, they should have been open later. Instead of working 12 hours a day, they should have worked 18 hours and gotten some of that nighttime drunk Harvard business.\u201d Everything is the fault <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">of people who are already exhausted. Man, that\u2019s some cold shit, that\u2019s some cold shit \u2013 from people that came from poverty. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s some nerve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">Now, all I can do is\u2014it\u2019s literally as if I\u2019m being forced out of the country. That\u2019s how I feel now, in a way. I don\u2019t like that. I wanted to feel like excited. I don\u2019t feel that way anymore. I feel like something is conspiring to squeeze me out of being able to be here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not alone in that feeling.
