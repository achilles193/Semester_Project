I found an amazing office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Really? Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Right... almost next to a hotel. It's what I envisioned, you know what I mean? It's clean and modern. Everybody was really nice and people that I clicked with. The woman... they're all therapists. I think there's one or two social workers maybe. But she... we talked for quite a long time. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">was like, we'd love... you'd be the first life coach here. She would love to have someone doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Is this for a sublease?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: It's... so I would have to take two four-hour blocks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Okay. [0:00:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. So now that's the thing. It's $350 a month. (Pause) So... which... it was... we talked about that, too. She was like, where are you right now in terms of whatever? And we were... I was like, well, I mean... I was like, to be honest, part of the reason I'm doing this is because I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">you've got to dive in somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: And something like this is highly motivating, I mean. She's like, no, a number of us were the same way. The building's been there a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Hmm, it's a new building?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It's very new, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Eva (sp?), Eva something? Basically this woman rented the whole building, and then she... let's say this was... you had rented everything here...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And then you rent out... you have a deal with the owner. And you, I don't know, whatever they do. But yes, this is their first year. [0:01:57] And she's like, a number of us were the same way. We just kind of... the first whatever months or even a year it's tough. You're trying to scramble to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">pay the rent and all that. But... so that was nice to hear. She was like, yeah, there's no easy way, I mean, unless you already have a ton of... I mean, you're not going to pick them off a tree. And I was telling her, I was like, this is kind of what I was looking for, because see, this is conducive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">You're projecting. It's a brand in a way, you know what I mean? You want people to... like when I come here, I... it's nice and spacious and comfortable, and that matters for people...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Especially when you can't do anything about insurance, and you have to charge them a certain amount. So we were talking about that. I don't know, I'm... and she was really cool. She was like, we try to get together every Friday, and we just talk about work and just whatever, whatever comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Hmm. [0:02:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: And she's like, we're all very friendly. And she's like, we do... we refer people to each other and all that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, she was cool. And she was like, yeah, so how'd you get into life...? I told her my whole story kind of. And she was like, that sounds great. What...? I told her... I was like, I see some... they know you. I mean, they don't know you, but they know of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: She's like, yeah, I've heard of her. I was like, yeah, she's been amazing. But yeah, I just said how I've done all this other grad stuff and writing and whatever, but that it's as if all this has led to this perfect kind of fit for...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: So, yeah... and she was very helpful. I told her about that I might do the Boston College thing. She was like, you should look into Brandeis?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560558\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: She's like, they have master's programs, too.

[0:04:06] And she was like, you should totally look in to that, that that might be something really good (inaudible at 0:04:12). I don't know, it just... it felt good. And I met a couple of the therapists who were there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: They're all... it reminded me of you and this vibe here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Everyone's kind of youngish? Or even if they're not there's just something. People seem very friendly and kind of vibrant and open. And that's... it felt really good. It also felt good because, when I was talking to her, I didn't feel like a fraud. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I'm sitting in this very nice office, whatever, and I felt like, yeah. I felt like... I didn't feel any weird... do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I'm not a therapist, I'm not trying to be a therapist.

I mean, that felt good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that has something to it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I didn't feel weird or like all these people are better than me or whatever it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: So now I've got to scramble. I mean, I've got to figure out a way to pay that... oh, and the one thing you do have to have is comprehensive... she has a deal with the owner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: And the owner has stipulated that everyone in the building has to have... if someone falls or whatever...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, trip and slip insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Comprehensive whatever it's called, yeah.

I think I need... I clearly need to take a small loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Hmm. [0:05:55] Everyone has to... in a building has to have that even if they're subleasing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: It's just, I guess, the landlord's just like, I don't want any issues...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Conservative coverage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's the same owner as the hotel, so my arming in people.

But she's like, we charge a certain amount. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">You... people around here go to therapy. They try to better themselves.

I don't know, maybe some therapists could be like, life coach? What the fuck, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">whatever, or... I don't know if there's some kind of thing there or not.

[0:11:58] Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT: Because really I was thinking (pause) conservative, right, I'm going to charge $125, $150?

A lot of people don't want to dish that out all the time. But a lot of people do. It's just about... oh, that's the other thing.

[0:14:59] Hmm. But I think some people actually think of it as having... building into their fee, whatever is their standard fee, an idea that it's actually slightly higher than what they want, so that there's even room to think about... so therefore you could see people...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: I read about that. Yeah, I read about... people were saying, if you're going to charge $100, charge $150. And that way you'd know that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Some people could afford that. Then you could see some people for $50.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: That's right, because you've padded it a little bit.

And that's why, if everyone was going to pay $100, I would just do $100.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">CLIENT: But, exactly because of that, it's got to be more, I think, than that, because I also know myself.

[0:15:59] She was like, you have to take into account that you're projecting something. So people will be happy to pay you $50 an hour. But they'll also view it a certain way. That's just the reality. They won't... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201451\">they might not see the worth in it as much. And I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">THERAPIST: Unless they don't have a lot of money. Right? That's a different person.

[0:29:58] There's certainly the cultural, linguistic reasons for that. But I also wonder (inaudible at 0:30:05) isn't something that that tells us about your early relational life with your own mother, maybe your <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2025B2\">father, too. But I'm thinking specifically of your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2025D\">CLIENT: Well, with the whole family, yeah.

You've got to make as much money as you can. Everything else is nonsense. And contextually I get that, because yeah, their lives have been pretty fucking hard.

So, I mean... and I'm not going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2031D1\">go teach wherever there's a job.

You learn to be a jeweler, and you're [a fucking] (ph) jeweler. You become a lawyer, and you're a lawyer. What is this willy nilly this-that?

When I've talked to people, I can tell they're very engaged with what I'm saying, and they're very excited about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20337\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20339\">CLIENT: And there are enough people that I really trust who...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2033B\">THERAPIST: Who know you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2033D\">CLIENT: Who know me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2033F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20341\">CLIENT: And who want the best for me. There's no weird motives or anything. And we're all very honest with each other. So I can... they're... they always touch base, they're giving me marketing ideas, they're giving me... some of them are like, why haven't you started already? You've got to just jump in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20343\">THERAPIST: (Mm-hmm (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20345\">CLIENT: So... but I think this was a big thing, though. [0:42:57] Today, that was kind of a big deal, because it was very professional. These people are doing the real thing in a very real-thing area. So to have people like that take you seriously and welcome you and be kind of excited to have you there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203451\">and then for me to see how I'm interacting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20347\">THERAPIST: And for you to also feel like it's a good enough fit for you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20349\">CLIENT: For me, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2034B\">THERAPIST: That it makes you then push to take...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2034D\">CLIENT: To take the risk, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2034F\">THERAPIST: To really take the plunge, yeah, which is what everybody does at the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20351\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20353\">THERAPIST: It's not a part that's unique to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20355\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So yeah, that stuff, that's what feels good in this case. I don't feel weird. I felt weird about Brown. I didn't feel so weird about London, but I always felt a little off kilter, something off kilter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20357\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20359\">CLIENT: This doesn't feel that way. This just feels like... (chuckling) I see no reason why it's not going to work. [0:43:59] It's... like you said, it's just about busting your butt. And it's going to take maybe a few years or whatever. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035D\">CLIENT: And it's not negating the things that are important to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20361\">CLIENT: That's the most important thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20363\">THERAPIST: In fact it could enhance them for a while...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20365\">CLIENT: It absolutely will enhance them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20367\">THERAPIST: Even while...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20369\">CLIENT: I think it will, I think it will. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2036B\">THERAPIST: Exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2036D\">CLIENT: I'm really psyched. I'm really psyched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2036F\">THERAPIST: So you're going to sign on the dotted line?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20371\">CLIENT: I mean, yeah. I mean, I've got to figure out how to pay for it. I mean, you know what? It's also a motivator of... this bank thing? I'm going to see maybe if they could... like an equity...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20373\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20375\">CLIENT: I could pay off my debts, some debts. Pay you, pay my credit card, just a couple things, you know what I mean? Have money to... a buffer for the rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20377\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20379\">CLIENT: That would be a really helpful thing.

Buying you a couple years, too (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2037D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's really not...

Your mom would have to sign it or your uncle?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2038D\">CLIENT: The issue... no, I think now we might... well, now the issue is, I don't have a job. So it has to be... that's why a credit union, it has to be like, look, we have this collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2038F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20391\">CLIENT: You've got to just take that, all right?
