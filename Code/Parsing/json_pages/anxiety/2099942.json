Eddie, on Jeremy's side, that was Jeremy's mom's best friend growing up, made brownies out of her apartment for a living and sold them to the building staff, and this is better, I'd say these were really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Wow. Like I said, they will not last long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Do you want one now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: It was Joanne's birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Also, tell me again, the dates that you're going to be out. I remember that we're on for Tuesday this coming week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I'm going to be out Wednesday through Monday, so Tuesday of the week after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: They're really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: They're really good. (laughs) Thanks for eating one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: No problem. Wow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: They are shamelessly underdone, which was part of why the recipe is so good. I think probably, bakers didn't care as much about salmonella in the '70s as they do today, because they're brownies aren't as good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Probably worth the salmonella.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: As long as we don't eat a whole tray. Wednesday through Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Wednesday through Monday. We're good on Tuesday this coming week and then I will also figure something out for... I guess it would be Tuesday or Friday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I'm a little nervous about the trip. I've had so many traumatic physical experiences while traveling, that it's just like there's just this constellation of anxiety provoking things that I'm anticipating. I take an early flight on Wednesday and traveling while tired, being away from my structure <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">and being away from Jeremy. (pause) Feeling lonely. So, it's not really occupying that much energy, because I've come so far in terms of my reaction to low blood sugar. It's really incredible. I don't I haven't felt dizzy in so long, and it's incredible what anxiety can do to your body chemically. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">So, so I don't really fear that I'm going to faint. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That's terrific.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: That's kind of a new scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's really different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: That's great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: And, I haven't done a lot of traveling to non-third world countries, so I think a lot of my fears are not going to be realized, because I can drink the water and my safety isn't in danger, and I can speak the language, and like all of these things that contribute to the feeling of loneliness <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">and not belonging, they're not really true about this trip. And it is perhaps, like the most plush trip I will ever go on in a first world country, like Kelly's paying for everything and there's five hours of this five-day conference, of every day, of free time for skiing and playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Do you ski? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: No. I want to learn how to snowboard. I think I would be good at it. I don't mind falling. So whatever I do, I don't mind falling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I don't snowboard but I've heard there's a lot of I don't ski any more either, but I heard there's a lot of falling involved at first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's why you have to do it for three or four days and it develops, if you want to learn anything. But I think it gets to a point which is shared among all of these travel experiences and in my daily life, which is a lack of self-soothing ability and feeling lonely. (pause) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">like the existential dread that comes along. Either it comes after feeling lonely or precedes it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099942\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">[Pause: 00:08:39 to 00:10:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: This is where I imagine it gets difficult to talk about something to do with the loneliness or the dread, because it gets in the way, I think, of how you otherwise want things to be here, like as though I there's something I'm not going to sort of take in well or that's going to disconnect <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">us if you say some of the things that you feel about that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I mean, it's put your hand in front of your mouth. That was a classic opportunity. I don't feel lonely here, I feel very connected, despite the disgruntle and the discouragement and the sadness about the reality. Why don't I talk about it more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: As we've talked about, there can be things about feeling lonely or what it's like when you're not here, that are hard to talk about, I think, or even hard to remember, I think because of worry about either some kind of response I'll have to them, such as you know, I'll kind of maybe brush <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">them off or try to talk you out of them, or it will make me not as excited about you or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">[Pause: 00:13:58 to 00:14:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I'm going to try and not face you here.

I also don't want it to change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: How long has this been harder, the last couple of days? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don't know about the last couple of days but in general, I feel like I got chewed up and spit back out at the end of our sessions, and then I have to recover. (pause) I deliberately used the passive voice, I don't feel like you chewed me up or that I (voice very soft; inaudible), but that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">what happens here. Even though I also feel like a connection gets stronger and stronger. (pause) I think it would be useful to take a break from everything else and just focus on this, and not have maybe like this and sitting and doing manual work and not have other stuff going on. There are places <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF2\">in the east where people do that. Not exactly in the context of psychotherapy but in the context of backwards, forward, psychological recovery. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Like retreats?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: There's this there's this Japanese school of I don't know, I'm reading about it in the Couch and the Tree books. And I go back to this part and talk about it, but the point is so much of the tension comes from like wanting to be immersed or can't, like not being not helping or being able <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">to be immersed, and then getting myself out of the land on hold. (pause) Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Um... (pause) Yeah, I was kind of... (pause) ... thinking back a little bit. I'm thinking of kind of the whole, what you're talking about. (pause) We just have a few minutes. There's something about a kind of (pause) there's something about perhaps an aspect of the tension between us and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B51\">a sense of being chewed up and spit out and yanking yourself out of these holes in the ground, that seems violent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And I think I can see how, you know, there are ways that the circumstances hold for some of that, but there's something else I think, like a kind of reaction to feelings that you're having. Leaving here could be a lot of things and many of them not good, but feeling chewed up and spit out <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B91\">is a pretty particular one. (pause) And I I was a little perplexed yesterday, I'm still a little perplexed, about the need to like, why do you have to yank yourself out of these?

I don't know how to face it head on, so it just feels like I'm getting like squeezed and there's not enough space or time <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF1\">(sniffles) or peace or calm with the feelings of compassion to just like let them resonate.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099942\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I see. And that was part of the idea about the retreat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: That was part of the idea about the retreat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, if this could just sort of like be this doesn't feel like a recreational thing, like coming in the structure of it feels wrong for how immersed I want to be in it and how little I feel available or prepared or able to really immerse myself when I'm not here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I think some of it is the structure here. It makes things very difficult. It's totally weird and unnatural to meet for these particular short blocks of time, spread out a few days over the week. It's weird. But I think (pause) it feels like there might also be something really scaring you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">about the feelings that you maybe react a little violently to it against yourself over. I don't know, maybe there's some way that I'm not aware of, that I'm contributing to that, but I'm not trying to tell you there's anything wrong. I just... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Well, it's pretty isolating, hard to it's hard to share the burden, which I think is how I'm used to processing anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I think you're trapped in your head along this most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: And if you don't yank yourself out of it, you would be stuck and spinning by yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, one, that feels awful. Two, I have this like other elephant, the graduate school, and I don't know, there's kind of a lot of pressure to be there. And I have this other elephant, Jeremy, who like poor guy, like he's like we were supposed to go on his insurance to save money, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">we paid $3,000 and then I was seeing someone outside of his insurance and then we're paying out of pocket for me to like spend time with a man I love who's not him, three times a week, which like doesn't feel appropriate for me or him. For me it feels completely inappropriate structure wise and like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D32\">too short and too little, and for him it feels the opposite. That's not a topic of discussion much any more. I'm sort of just doing my own thing but it's isolating, it's not something I have a whole lot of support with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">Remember when we talked on the phone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: That was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: I'm going to stop now, but if you let me out this, that will give us a chance to talk on the phone together before Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yesterday I wanted to talk on the phone with you but I talked to myself and it was really nice. It was a self-soothing activity that happened to work yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: You've said quite a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: You said quite a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: Thanks for listening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Sure.
