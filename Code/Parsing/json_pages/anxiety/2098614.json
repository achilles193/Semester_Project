I just moved it. There are actually more changes coming up. The desk, I think, is going, and there may actually be some things coming in to go up on the walls. I think it's about time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: You're all about change now, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I have such a hard time with getting my prescriptions refilled. They only give me two refills and then Micah wants me to renew it through the pharmacy, so they contact her. The last couple of times I've done that and they get screwed up. I can't figure it out. She's like, \"I called them.\" I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">like my pharmacy, but \u2013 have you got a cold?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: No. Not that I knew of. Sorry. I'm all stuffed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: It's all right. Everybody has boogers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Everybody has boogers. Yeah, so she called them... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I've got to call her. I went in and got a couple of extra pills on Saturday, and then I call her on Monday. Shouldn't you guys be calling? I don't know. It's become very frustrating. It's like you can do this stuff online. It's supposed to be easy and they make it so difficult. I used to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">a lot of problems at my old pharmacy. That's why I switched to this one. This one is open 24 hours and it's big. I don't feel like switching. It's a pain. That's my big gripe.  It was a busy weekend. I had Cub Scouts on Friday night from like 6:00 \u2013 8:00, the pack meeting. By like 7:30 Ian was a zombie. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">He'd had it. Then we had his learn-to-skate lesson and he did really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: He did a really neat course. That afternoon he wanted to go skating again so I took him for lunch because we had a \"go see it\" with his Cub Scout den, not to be confused with his pack. The pack is made up of dens. We went to the fire station and had a blast. We got to go up on the trucks and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">do the fire hose. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: The pole?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: No, they wouldn't let them do the pole, which I don't blame them. It's kind of high liability, these six-year-old kids flying down the pole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I was thinking they'd be psyched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: They would. I bet you half of them wouldn't do it, though. But he wanted to go skating. We went to lunch and he was like, \"Let's go skating.\" I was like, \"None of the places are open, buddy. It's November.\" Just the hockey rinks have ice and they're open, but everybody's playing hockey on them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">Of course, on Sunday I joked with Jess, \"Does Ian want to go skating today?\" She was like, \"I don't know. I haven't talked to him about it.\" An hour later she was like, \"Do you know of any rinks?\" (both laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: A lot of times little kids will get frustrated at skating at first because they fall down a lot, it's cold, and the ice is hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: He did this unicycle thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: For the circus where he's on a unicycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's right. I remember you telling me about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: He did the entire parade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Oh, my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: So the kid's got balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I think that made a huge difference in his ability to pick this up. He had some hard falls. He was in pain on Sunday with his arm, but it didn't deter him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098614\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Which, now I'm going to sign him up for Sunday snowboarding lessons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I was going to say, wait until he gets his kid on skis or snowboards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: They say you start snowboarding in kindergarten, so I'm going to start him on snowboard. Six lessons, six Sundays in a row. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: When do they have lessons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: You get a morning pass. Once he kind of figures it out after a couple of lessons I can take him on the hill. It's $46 for a morning pass for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Ooh. Ouch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That first lesson I'm just going to be hanging out for an hour. I don't know if they have a bar open at 9:00 AM.  (chuckles) It's the best part of the ski lodges. I was always worried that he would hurt himself and then struggle with it and not want to do it. That's kind of starting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">happen with swimming, where he's afraid of the big pool and he's afraid to go underwater. The fact that he banged himself up in skating and really had fun with it... it is supposed to have a pretty good ski program, so we'll see how it goes. At least it will give me an excuse to get out and do some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">snowboarding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Will that conflict with the football games?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: No. It doesn't start until January. There might be that first one that might conflict, but I may just sell those tickets. It might conflict with some play-off games. His mom can take him out, but we'll see. Plus it's 9:00 in the morning so if it's an afternoon game or a night game, I could still <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">do that. I'm not sure \u2013 it is not that far, but it's still like a half-hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: It's probably further than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Forty minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: An hour [continual.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: No. I live near here. I just want you to have the facts. You know I'm not living at home, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: (laughs) It's only 40 minutes to one, and that's past 495. The other slope is less than an hour or about an hour, so maybe it's only 45 minutes. It's forty-five minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe if you go...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: We're talking Sunday morning, too. There should be no one on the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and you'd probably go 95 or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: No, I'd probably shoot out \u2013to 2 then 495. I don't know, but I'm sure they've got directions on their website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: from here to 495 is a good 40 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: That way I can extract my snowboarding equipment without Jess saying, \"Oh, you're going snowboarding all the time now.\" I was thinking that I may go during the week when it's cheaper \u2013 go by myself or find people willing to take the day off to board. It's significantly cheaper during the week. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">I don't know how much I'm going to be able to go. It's pretty expensive $46 for just a morning \u2013 and that's a small mountain. I don't even know if it is a mountain; it's a hill. It's actually a valley. I don't know why you would name the ski resort \"a valley.\" You'd want something that would suggest <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B2\">height, like the Valley, which is a pretty decent mountain, but the name doesn't really market as well, that's why people just call it the Valley.....<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you don't really want that either. \"Ville\" either. A \"ville\" is like a town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: You want something like [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: (pause) It was an uneventful week. I have all of these closings next week. I probably should go into the office today and get people to send me all the stuff, maybe get things done on Friday, go into the office. Except for one title, I'm all caught up on titles; even my own titles.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098614\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: That's great. It also sounds pretty good with Ian, not just how he's doing, but also you're running around doing activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, Stella is a different story. Jess intervenes. She doesn't like that with stuff. She blames it on me not seeing her enough, and it's just like it doesn't seem normal that a child would latch onto her mom like she does where she's just holding onto her in public. It's just bizarre. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: It can vary a lot. What does she do? Is she grabbing her leg all the time when they're out places?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. She's either in the stroller or grabbing her leg. It's like you try and interact with her and she'll go, \"Aaahh,\" and go over and grab her mom's leg.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: She's 20 months?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Is that normal at 20 months?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I just remember she was born in February, end of February. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: When I go to the house, unless she just woke up, she's typically not in a cranky mood. Jess says that she talked about playing with me with the soccer ball outside in the rain, so she says she talked about me. All I have to do is some little game of peek-a-boo and she starts laughing; but if <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">I tried to pick her up she would...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: You mean at the house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: No. I mean she gives me hugs and kisses all the time, but like outside. Or if I meet up with her and Jess, like at the skating ring. We were there for an hour and a half. There was pretty much time for her to warm up. Other than some little peek-a-boo stuff, she never really warmed up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: She's just a mama's girl for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but is it worth me trying to...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: No, Cameron, you should just give up. Of course it is. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Fool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: No, no. Make the effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: I'm allowed to be sarcastic. In your profession it doesn't come off very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Sorry. Did you feel like I was being critical? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: No, but don't you think sarcasm goes to people's self-esteem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Was I actually sarcastic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: You were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What did I say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: You said, \"Yeah, Cameron, you should just give up.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Oh, you're right. You're right. I was. (both chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: I'm just giving you a hard time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Wait \u2013 I'm going to be sarcastic again. Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: I know we're not supposed to have this much fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Why not? (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: I don't know. I think the insurance company would be disappointed. These people would be disappointed. Maybe not. Now you're trying to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Dust it off. Well with you turning the focus onto me and onto that you were doing things the wrong way, it makes me think we must be getting to something. I know I'm teasing you a little bit. Maybe we can just talk about some of this stuff with Stella. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Or maybe it was \u2013 I don't know \u2013 did it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: I'm looking at it more from the perspective that Jess's doing something wrong or that she should be doing something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I see. To facilitate the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean her mom had the same problem picking her up from day care, when she just cried. She even took Ian along for some familiarity or whatever, and that didn't work. I met them and I was like, \"What's the matter?\" She was like, \"Mama.\" I was like, \"You want your mom?\" and she was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">\"Yeah.\" (pause) Ian was never really that bad, where he was... I was around all the time, though. That might have made a difference. Stella misses Ian when he's gone. I don't know if she calls him \"Geen\" any more or if she says \"Ian\" or \"Ima.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098614\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Why does she call him Ima?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Because she couldn't say Ian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Oh, Stella.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Stella. Yeah. She first started calling him that. Now I think she says \"Ima.\" (pause) Ian doesn't want to play hockey, though. His mom has already brainwashed him about football and hockey. He was like, \"Football and hockey are very dangerous sports. I don't want to play those.\" I tried to explain <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">it. I go, \" Well, you can do skating.\" He was like, \"That's not a sport.\" I go, \"Yes, it is. There is speed skating in the Olympics. You get big, fat quads.\" He'd be too lanky, I think, for speed skating. It's funny. He's taller than all the other kids and Stella is shorter than all the other kids; <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF2\">so the two of them together are even more skewed.  I'm pretty nauseous this morning. I had a lot of mucous last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: That hurts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: I guess I had a lot more than the average bear. I seemed to have been doing better where I wasn't even gagging in the morning. This morning I threw up a bunch of snot and saliva coughing. I don't know if I should drink ginger ale in the morning to settle my stomach; drink ginger. I don't like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">raw ginger. It's kind of spicy, and ginger snaps are a little spicy. (pause)  I think of all the Holiday crap already. I go right from the political campaign to the Holiday. It's just unrelenting. (pause) I wonder if I should buy people gifts or not. I have a little extra money, but is it smarter for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C32\">me to keep it and have a rainy day for the months I don't have closings? They sent me a title order on Sunday and so I'm figuring they're pretty busy if she's working on Sunday. Maybe she was trying to catch up. I don't know. (pause) I don't know. I'm supposed to get one more order from that. On deal died. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Do you get paid if the deal died?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: No. I spent money and I lose the money \u2013 not a lot $25 $50. Some post-its and shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It doesn't seem to happen very often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Not with the good lenders. I have some old contacts who pay down all the time, but I kind of price that into a particular lender. This one has me charge less than I used to charge. They told me that I'd make it up with volume and that I would have little fall-out. So far, I think only two deals <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">have fallen out, which is not bad. (pause) (sigh)  I have a trial. The other party is supposed to propose a pre-trial memorandum \u2013 draft a pre-trial memorandum \u2013 and they haven't done it yet. I've been emailing her. It should have been done a week ago. Actually, the order came out months ago so, technically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB2\">it should have been out months ago. It's like someone else, once again, isn't doing their job so it makes my job \u2013 I don't know if it's tactical or not, but it's hard for me to prepare. I don't know what their case is all about because they've disclosed barely anything. The pre-trial memo is where they're <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB3\">really supposed to be pretty descriptive in what's going to happen. I'm trying to exclude their main witness for not disclosing reports and things they should be reporting because they're an expert. I can't do that until I know what they say he's going to testify on. I guess I could be doing my research <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB4\">and find a case. I'm getting a little anxious. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098614\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">I got a haircut. It's the longest haircut I've ever had a Supercuts. The woman thought she was like on TV, just going \u2013 you know. At the end she was taking the buzzer. Just cut my hair short. If you have to ask me if it's too short, then it's not short enough; or, \"Is this okay?\" The answer is, \"No. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">Shorter.\" She said, \"I love cutting hair like this.\" I'm like, \"Well, then I wish you more bald men in the future.\" You would think my hair would be easy to cut, but it's not. I probably should just cut it myself; just shave it all off. I have an ugly scalp, though. Lord even knows what it looks like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD2\">back here. I'm sure everyone knows but me. I've got all kinds of bumps and scabs, a 666 tattoo. (pause)  I'm going to buy a nice scanner like the one Jess has. They're not that expensive. I do a lot of volume. I could use it as a copier or I could scan it and just print it out. It would save me some <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD3\">time. The scanner I have at the house is pretty slow and doesn't do multiple sizes. It does letter size and I do a lot of legal scanning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yes. This could save you trips up to that office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Well, no, I would actually keep it in the office because I'd probably use it more in there and then I'd still have the worst-case scenario at home. At home I could just put stuff in to scan and go take a bike ride. It's not like I have to worry about my time at home with how long it takes to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">scan something. It does take a long time. A lot of times I'll do work at the office and bring it home to scan, where I won't have to do that. I'll be able to scan in the office. (pause)  I may go to the office tomorrow or on Friday. (pause) Today I'm going straight to the office from here. I pick Ian <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D12\">up from school; check some mail. One of the things, too, is I've got to check my mail. I can't go a week without checking my mail. There shouldn't be any traffic today. It's a vacation week. (pause)  Just a little slobber. I didn't shave. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I keep having to avoid talking about things that you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Don't want to talk about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: ... that you feel responsible for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Like what? My apartment's a mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Why don't you tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: It's my fault because I don't clean it up and put things away or throw things away. There. I've taken responsibility for my dirty apartment. Is that what you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yes and no. I mean, you did bring that up, but then you just kind of wrote it off or closed on it very quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Oh. You mean I should be looking at solution to my dirty apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: If it's something that matters to you, that is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: I'm thinking someday I'm going to have a visitor. It might happen. To have the apartment a little more neat... My visitor wouldn't judge me as much. Maybe when I have to move everything. That would help me clean up some stuff \u2013 moving everything into the one room. When I have to move everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E51\">back to the other room, I can organize the apartment. Just trying to be more efficient. Get a desk. I'm working off the coffee table, which is horrible for my back. If I set up a desk, there's more room in the room \u2013 Ian's room.  So I avoid talking about responsibility. Yeah. What does that mean? How <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E52\">does that make you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098614\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Your view of how this seems to work is to come in...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: I'm really not sure how this works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. What are your thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: My thought is that it's like you kind of vent and talk about things that are bothering you; usually things other people are doing that you don't... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: How people are fucking up my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: There is a lot of that going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: It sounds that way from the way you talked about it. Certainly. But it reminds me of how it can be hard for you to do work. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Because I'm lazy? That wouldn't have anything to do with not taking responsibility \u2013 wanting to talk about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Sure it could, if that's the correct diagnosis \u2013 laziness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: But there are no lazy people. [...] (inaudible at 00:34:58) journal for your own laziness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: I don't know very much about [...] (inaudible at 00:35:06) about laziness. Mostly, I think the definition of laziness reflects the same sort of cop-out that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: I like that word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: ... the laziness itself would involve. Actually, as I think about it, I think it's characteristic of what we're talking about. You'll chalk it up to laziness, you'll presume it's this enduring trait that you have, you'll be provocative with me about it, and it's all a way of not taking it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">up. Not taking it up in particular, something that causes you considerable trouble \u2013 which is there are things you want to be better, as you've told me about getting done. Now I know that you're working better now than you have in a while. It's something you've told me recently, and that's terrific. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201032\">I think it's a big deal. I think it's hard for you to work here and I think you use the idea of laziness in a few different ways to get out of work here and elsewhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: So what? Isn't that really what defines laziness \u2013 someone who wants to get out of work? I mean, you're making somewhat of a circular argument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: I'm saying I'm lazy and you're saying I'm using lazy not to do things, which is the very essence of what laziness is. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yep. Well... I guess...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: I don't know if it's a circular argument, but it's at least a chicken and an egg.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Sure. No, I think you're right. I guess my way out of it is this: There are two reasons that I'm bringing it up. One is there are some situations... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: I did well on the logic part of the LSAT, but the reading comprehension \u2013 not so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: I think there are two points about your point. One is there are some situations, such as with your work, where I think you're ambivalent about it. On one hand, you would describe yourself as lazy but, on the other hand, I think it does bother you sometimes. You've told me that you want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">be able to get to things and, maybe until the last minute, you've put them off. In that instance, you're at least not happy about being lazy or you're kind of ambivalent or there are moments where there is something you want to address. And in here, I don't know if you're aware of being that way \u2013 if <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201132\">you're aware of doing something that I think is closely tied in with what you call laziness in your life. So I guess I'm waiving my arms about that and saying that it could probably be usefully looked at in here, if that's something that you wanted to do, although you're absolutely right that that would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201133\">have to come from you. I mean, I can point it out and fuss about it, but it's up to you, really. I think you actually do want to work on it, in part, although I think you also don't. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098614\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: (whispers) That's because I'm lazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: I think the laziness is related to feeling lonely about yourself. I think one of the reasons you've been able to work more recently \u2013 I think the extent to which you're able to work probably tracks pretty well with feeling better about yourself and better about getting work and money. Work <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">is coming in \u2013 you know. Feeling better about yourself, more social. So you can call it laziness if you want, but it is affected by the thing about how you're doing. And I think that's one reason why it's a workable issue, do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: There's not a pill?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Nope. No, pills can help. If you're depressed and you take an antidepressant, it can make it easier to get motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: No, I'm talking about an anti-laziness pill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Well, I think that's what I'm saying. Pills can make a difference, but that's already kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: I'm on pills for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: So how much more lazy was I? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: Much more lazy? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: It's like I didn't go get my [winter share] (ph?) because I just felt too lazy. (pause) I haven't been cooking [...] (inaudible at 00:41:47) I did really good at the beginning of the summer, but not so much now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Cameron, if you want to call it lazy you can call it lazy, that's fine. I'm just saying that it's affected by other things like feeling crummy, feeling lonely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: So I have to change those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Or one of the ways psychotherapy can work is by looking at those things \u2013 how feelings of loneliness and crumminess about yourself \u2013 you can kind of address the laziness in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: (pause) I'm not sure how you look at feeling crummy. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: I think you have some idea what it would mean to work on things like this. I don't actually think you need a description from me. I think you're kind of trying to shift the focus onto what I think rather than what you think it might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: Not take responsibility with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">THERAPIST: Yeah.
