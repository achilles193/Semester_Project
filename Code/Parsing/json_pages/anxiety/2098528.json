Oh, being excited about my novel. Did I tell you that story? I met so the woman who moderated the reading is the wife of the guy that I do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. The novel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F1\">idea that's I've had since forever, the germ of it, the kernel of it came from him. So, not that he said, \u2018write a novel,' he just said something that then kind of blew my mind that gave me an idea. But, I've been kind of almost willing to share this with her because you know, the husband died and all <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F2\">that, it's like such a personal thing and no one knows that, so she and I have decided to do a little writer's like maybe meet like once or every other week or whatever, yeah, because she's working on a novel, too. So, this last on Monday she showed me a chunk of her work, whatever, and I told her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F3\">about my novel and she was blown away. You know, it was like you know it was like, her husband kind of inadvertently gave me this idea so I've always but anyway so she had explained the idea and like a kind of a plot and whatever and she was just I mean I respect her opinion. She was like, ah, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F4\">was like, \u2018I love it.' She said, \u2018you have to write that. You have to finish that.' So like there's that.
