It\u2019s the pressure it creates just by the amount of time it takes up, the time to think or collect myself or (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s extraordinarily long hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s not every day, just a couple of days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: A couple of days you\u2019ve got to pull out that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: I mean every day I have to get up, so 7:30. 7:30, I mean not 7:30. I mean I have to be at the bus at 7:30 so I have to get up at 6:00. And the bus has just been [inaudible] watch two buses pull out just as I got there. So in the morning the bus left just as I [inaudible] I got there. So\u2026 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200911\">I missed it. And then when I left for work the bus left too. So I mean you feel kind of powerless. It\u2019s pretty aggravating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah, is that why you were late today? [15:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, missed the bus today. I mean I spent a lot of time trying to put this date together. I had a list of things to do and they just weren\u2019t fitting correctly. And so I\u2019m having lunch with someone at 1:00 but there\u2019s two hours between the end of that and this. And so I mean nothing really fit <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200951\">together quite right. I\u2019m going to go into work today, too, so this week it\u2019ll be seven days a week. But yeah, I missed\u2026 the buses weren\u2019t running favorably. So there\u2019s one at 9:30 that I checked, too late. Because I said oh, I\u2019m only 3 miles away so I assumed that I kind of [inaudible] it up to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200952\">bus. Twenty minutes in advance I should be okay, which isn\u2019t to say I always do it though. Yeah, the buses\u2026 so I missed the bus at 9:30 just by laying in bed. And at 9:55 or something this bus came. And then I very well managed [inaudible] something wrong. So they keep [inaudible] delayed. Like during <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200953\">a snowstorm I had a class at 7:40 and I planned to meet the same person before the class. So I think we planned to meet at 6:30. So I got to the bus in time to arrive\u2026 at the stop in time to arrive at 6:30. But because the buses were piled up in a weird way the bus got me there just in time for class, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200954\">an hour later. [16:41] So that\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563401\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] this year?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Well yeah, we could [inaudible] but it\u2019s just to show that the bus is pretty bad [inaudible] I don\u2019t want to be on the bus. So I mean I missed the bus yesterday. I\u2026 so I just wait in this pizza shop and read a book about parasails, which is pretty engaging. And so I catch the next bus just barely. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">And I get home and there\u2019s someone from my church eating with the lady whose house I live in. [inaudible] pasta and meatballs and sauce and soup and crackers and then popcorn. And so I was eating that and then the lady was trying to schedule when I\u2019m going to work on the newsletter for this month. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200992\">I said Thursday and [inaudible] and all that stuff. Then I went upstairs and then I fell asleep. I woke up and I tried to plan my day today. So after I leave here I think I\u2019ll go shopping while listening to this story on the radio about car dealerships. And then read [inaudible] meet my friend, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200993\">go back, drink coffee [inaudible] groceries [inaudible] just trying to put it together. It\u2019s not very interesting or important. [18:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s\u2026 what is the\u2026 so the\u2026 kind of the feeling of having the\u2026 it\u2019s sort of something to schedule, not buses be all fucked up and having that\u2026 kind of be places and [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: I want to do more than I have the means to [inaudible] accomplish.

He was asking for information [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">the guy\u2019s just pumping me up and pumping me up, and so I just keep asking for information. And so I shut him down. I mean my biggest supporter. [20:23] The guy that\u2019s the general manager. He\u2019s just telling me how great I\u2019m going to be in the business. But I need certain facts about how things go. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A92\">I kind of wish he was still pumping me up a little bit. He still does it [inaudible] He\u2019s a character. But I need to feel a little more natural.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: How\u2019s it been going, trying to sell? You\u2019re selling new ones? What\u2019s it been like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: I get to know some people. I\u2019ve\u2026 recently I got really worried about the impressions I make on my superiors. So I think I\u2019ve been looking for it but not\u2026 but doing less and less well. I mean every time I don\u2019t sell someone it\u2019s more of a burden of doubt. It\u2019s a burden of doubt and I\u2019m really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD1\">afraid of failure. I\u2019m afraid of failing. So I\u2019ve got to a point, psychologically, where I don\u2019t want to approach new customers because I don\u2019t want to fail myself or the dealership in that way. Because it costs money to bring them in and all that stuff. I just\u2026 yeah, I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD2\">approach them. [21:51] I approach each person, or I used to, with the [inaudible] of if they\u2019re here, they want to buy a car. So no matter what they say they took the time to come here. But it\u2019s\u2026 I mean I\u2019ve been accepting excuses lately from people. And yeah, I\u2019m afraid of failure I think. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD3\">I mean I think where I\u2019ve been or the only place I\u2019ve accepted myself is being\u2026 is a friend of the pack or doing very well wherever I am, which is better than everyone around me. And it\u2019s not really acceptable to me that I wouldn\u2019t be very good at whatever I\u2019m doing. So that\u2019s related. I\u2019m afraid of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD4\">not doing well.

What kind of\u2026 I mean just to say it strikes me as somewhat similar as your experience with that woman that we last discussed, and your feelings around closing the deal with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">her. It has a very similar quality. And it\u2019s almost like this\u2026 taking this job is a way of trying to work on this kind of\u2026 I see it as in some way you\u2019ve been wanting to feel more of a sense of hey, I can impact, I can persuade, I have\u2026 not just because of the art or a skill, maybe that, but also that\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">a connectiveness, a kind of feeling of place and importance, respect, influence. And I think you come into it with a lob of doubt about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I also think it must\u2019ve been\u2026 I mean it wasn\u2019t good that we didn\u2019t get to meet last week. [24:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: While you were going through all this [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, also my school came up. I mean I was\u2026 the general manager was asking me about where I went to school. And the sales manager, too, was there. We were talking. They were saying Lawrenceville has these alumni events. Do you ever talk to people from there. And I just said something like\u2026 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">mean the core [ph?] of the school\u2019s pretty preppy. I know people at the fringes but I didn\u2019t\u2026 so [inaudible] people. [inaudible] body of people. And I remember the general manager sort of walking away, turn his back and [inaudible] disappointment. It was a very instantaneous reaction. So I mean [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B92\">prospective business contacts but\u2026 and there\u2019s also the fact that I\u2019m pretty privileged. And the only way I sort of\u2026 the only outlook of it is that it\u2019s sort of bruised feelings about the experience. [26:21] I mean the guy himself had just been talking momentarily about how he\u2019d done his job. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B93\">he\u2019d paid for his daughter\u2019s school and when she got out of there she was on her own. And that\u2019s all he wanted to do was get her a car and get her through college. And that\u2019s it. Hands off after that. And he\u2019d be\u2026 if she has a diploma he\u2019d be happy. So he\u2019d just finished saying that and so that made <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B94\">me think. It made me wonder if maybe what I was afraid of at the time when I was going to the high school was that they would take me back, that I would have to go back home, or there would be this idea that I wasn\u2019t ready for the challenges that I was facing. And maybe that was a\u2026 pushing back a reality, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B95\">that I experienced too much too quickly. And so Lawrenceville, just like you might think of masturbation, with me Lawrenceville is sort of a catchall for a sort of an adverse experience of growing up, sort of a compilation of some necessary experiences put together too soon maybe. Because it wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B96\">the structure that I\u2019d been used to up to that point. [27:52] So the way\u2026 I know when you have parents and they\u2019re in your life they sort of control the flow of new information, the flow of experiences you have. There\u2019s a regulation there. But when you\u2019re\u2026 when they\u2019re not in your life that valve is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B97\">gone. That\u2019s the thought. But I mean the fact is that I\u2019m still thinking about Lawrenceville and it\u2019s still sort of a bruising experience years later. I mean I put my eyes down and I don\u2019t know what to say about it. It\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563401\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: And we haven\u2019t gotten through that. And I mean that\u2019s one explanation but I could have a different explanation next week. My conclusion about it, though, is it\u2019s really that I\u2026 I mean I had a good experience and I\u2026 or it wasn\u2019t a good experience but I was fortunate to experience those things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">at an earlier age than other people. [29:07] The general manager said the same thing that other people have said since I was eight years old. So I mean you look so much like I have a [ph?] five year old and then [inaudible] but I was 35 or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: What does that mean to you?

I don\u2019t really expect to be understood anymore, but it\u2019s wonderful when I am.

Like misperceived though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: I mean they\u2019re seeing something [inaudible] perception, so in spite of who I am I take things seriously.

And what I was thinking about Lawrenceville is that okay, yeah, intellectually you were ready, you were ready for that experience, but there was something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C72\">the emotional and the psychological experience where you were still an adolescent. You needed help. You needed support. You needed somebody who was helping you grow in that way. You weren\u2019t\u2026 yeah, you maybe had a sophisticated kind of intellect but you were still growing as a teenager in the same way <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C73\">as a lot of people. And it was hard for you. Lawrenceville was hard for you, I think. less intellectually, more kind of emotionally, socially. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: I had a wonderful dream somewhere that we\u2026 I had just finished watching Biography movies on redheads and stuff, and then I had this wonderful dream about this girl I met in high school, Rachel Wilder. [32:37] She was beautiful and she was\u2026 I mean if there were two girls who were really attractive <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">in that grade she was one of them, probably the most attractive. In ninth grade I started flirting with her, and I was doing okay. But then one time she was walking by and I sort of\u2026 I slapped her ass with a ruler in front of some other guys. She didn\u2019t like that very much. So we didn\u2019t talk much after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563401\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I\u2026 yeah, I didn\u2019t do as well. I was sort of crowded out slowly by other guys. But it was just very sweet. She sort of stuck with me as a genuine affection that I had. But she came back to me in a dream, and she wasn\u2019t young; she was grown up and vivacious. I don\u2019t remember much <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">about it but I had the dream, and it was a natural [ph?] experience. It felt\u2026 you feel grounded. You feel like yourself in a dream sometimes. And I was\u2026 I remember we, I don\u2019t know, I\u2026 there was some sort of intercourse with her that wasn\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: You got the girl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Well it wasn\u2019t sexual. It was\u2026 I didn\u2019t get it, it was we just talked or something. I approached her confidently or something like that. Then I woke up and masturbated and felt horrible. And it does affect me, too, when I don\u2019t have as much pep on the job. I\u2019m beginning to\u2026 I mean I\u2019m beginning <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">to wonder, and I don\u2019t want to reemphasize this now, I mean I wonder whether I shoot myself in the foot sometimes because I\u2019m afraid of failing or afraid of successes or something like that. [34:38] I mean it\u2019s difficult because the bosses actually\u2026 they really like me. They relate to me. They appreciate <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D12\">me.

It\u2019s some sort of expectation. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t just be loved as I am but I\u2026 it just doesn\u2019t exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: What do you think they see in you?

And talked to her. A funny thing happened though. So I mean I [inaudible] this girl and told her so I\u2019ll see you every Tuesday or whatever. And I said that the first time.

I mean I just\u2026 she\u2019s talking on the cell phone, I\u2019m not going to try\u2026 and I was thinking at first of just approaching her and, I don\u2019t know, fooling around with her or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F51\">But she\u2019s on the cell phone so to me that\u2019s a statement of saying you don\u2019t matter to me. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s some girl mind game, but the funny thing was, I\u2019m reading there. She\u2019s right here standing up and I\u2019m reading right here. And then this woman next to me reaches out and grabs her bag and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F52\">shakes her bag and as like do you want to sit here? Do you want to sit here? And the girl turns around, she\u2019s like what are you talking\u2026 and the lady\u2019s like do you want to sit here. And I\u2019m just watching the whole thing because it\u2019s something she would expect I would do, is ask her to sit with me. [39:21] <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F53\">But instead, this woman right next to me did it.

And so the woman grabbed the girl\u2019s bag and says do you want to sit next to me. And she said no. But she was\u2026 I mean that\u2019s something she would think I would do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: You would do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: Right.

Well my manager has a saying that it doesn\u2019t matter whether they have one eye, one leg, one eye, they\u2019re deaf, dumb, retarded, blind. You\u2019re going to sell them a car. So once, when a blind guy came into the dealership, I knew I had to try. (laughter) I\u2019m going through the aerodynamics and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">showing him how it feels and stuff and how cool it is, the interior and stuff like that. But the guy had this car he\u2019s upside down on. He owes $8000 and he wants to trade it in. So the only thing he could possibly buy is a used car. So I decided it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference and I\u2019d just get <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201012\">this car that\u2019s two years old that he could actually afford that\u2019s the same model. And I\u2019m showing him all the features and the cool design and how there\u2019s extra hood [ph?] space and stuff. [40:50] And he likes it. We go for a test drive and then I get out, and usually when a customer takes the keys <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201013\">I just tell them to hold on to the keys. It\u2019s a psychological thing. So the guy takes the keys, they try to hand them to you, you say no, that\u2019s okay, you hold on to them. And so they have the keys, right. Well this guy, he\u2019s blind, right, and he just tosses the keys on my lap. And I say well don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201014\">you want the car. He says it\u2019s\u2026 everything\u2019s great but it\u2019s used. It\u2019s like\u2026 so he could smell it. It was just [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: So he wanted a new one but at the right price or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563401\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: He absolutely needed a new one, and he thought that the car he had just financed and made four payments on was worth something.

[42:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah, how\u2026 so what have you been finding\u2026 I know we have to stop in a minute but what have you been finding a struggle? What\u2019s been the thing for you that\u2026 what have you been finding getting in the way? What\u2019s been challenging about\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">CLIENT: Selling a car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how much to listen to people anymore. If someone says they\u2019re on a lunch break, do I adjust my process for that or do I just keep going, assuming they\u2019re lying. Someone drives up in a car and they don\u2019t even\u2026 I mean they\u2019ve parked the car and it\u2019s still running. How do I bring them <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">into the dealership?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: Also, I have to shut up when my manager comes in. I mean here are people with 17 or more years of experience selling cars, so they tell me just to be quiet. Once the manager comes in, then pay attention to the manager so he can do the work so the person\u2019s not distracted and feel like two people <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">are digging into him. But to me, of course, there are sometimes things that I\u2019d do differently at that stage or things I know that the manager doesn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">CLIENT: That they can\u2019t use. [43:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it\u2019s hard to know how to work as a team in that\u2026 at that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I need to know how to hand it off well. I need to work better with my superiors. The biggest thing for me, the worst thing that can happen, is another salesman takes someone I\u2019ve worked on. It\u2019s like someone jumping into bed with a woman you\u2019ve wooed. It\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yeah, isn\u2019t that kind of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: That gets in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: That happens, though, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Well I just\u2026 when I was just starting I asked a guy whether we had something in stock, and he used that as a way to enter into my conversation. And the managers let it happen so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, they\u2019re like whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: That fucks you up. That\u2019s what Braveheart is about. That\u2019s like the First Knight or whatever. The lords come in and screw people\u2019s wives, the First Knight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the same sort of thing. So I need to get mine sorted out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: Okay. Listen, just to say, I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t have anything available last week for us. I did\u2026 I had kept it in mind, it\u2019s just that I just\u2026 I think we talked about a Tuesday opening up and it just didn\u2019t\u2026 but yeah, I did have it on my mind to try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just\u2026 I hope we can keep the sessions productive so I get some space or [inaudible] in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I realize this is not easy. This is not an easy month because of what happened last week and then on vacation. So I get that. Okay, I\u2019ll see you next Thursday then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
