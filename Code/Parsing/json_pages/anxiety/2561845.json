And then, the dogs needed something. And I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t get to sleep until really late. And then, the dogs woke me up at\u2014or Josh woke me up, because the dogs were freaking out at 4:00 a.m. (chuckles) I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">don\u2019t know why. They seemed fine. So, I take them out at 4:00 a.m. And I was just furious (chuckles) for no\u2014I was just so mad to have been woken up and\u2014I was just\u2014I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep.  And I just felt exhausted, but I was just so mad. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And Josh felt really bad, but\u2014so, I took an Ativan. Because it seemed like a good use of it. And then, I slept until\u2014for another few hours and felt really happy about that. Because otherwise, I would feel really miserable today and upset \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

No, things started getting in the way. Work, and then, being angry. Right?

I mean, even just the weather this past weekend has been really (crosstalk at 00:01:54).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Just really dismal for \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: one thing too much. (chuckles) And I spent all of yesterday getting Josh sorted out with pain medication and a new doctor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I know you said you had a new appointment yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Right. Which turned out to be wonderful. The doctor assessed the situation exactly how Josh was feeling. Asked him how he was feeling. Who\u2019s also a cyclist. Just a good personality for him, too, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: What specialty is this guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: He\u2019s just a primary care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: So, we needed a primary care \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:02:29) but you\u2014that\u2019s\u2014I mean, you really need someone to be the point person. (chuckles) I mean, the primary care can be the someone who organizes all the other doctors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. Well, it made it worse, because we had gotten\u2014we\u2014he had had one who was not wanting to deal with the pain problem. Not wanting to prescribe the narcotics. Not wanting to talk to him about it. Not responding to his calls. Just basically treating him like can addict and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s so unfortunate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, a\u2014it was just\u2014there was just no communication that was\u2014it was making everyone upset. (chuckles) And Josh was trying to have the psychiatrist at Portsmouth, who was in charge of\u2014I don\u2019t even know what he was in charge of. The one who started with the pain drug but wasn\u2019t supposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">to continue them. I guess at Portsmouth, I guess they\u2019re not supposed to prescribe, because I guess Providence has a huge drug problem. I don\u2019t know. (chuckles) It\u2019s just a mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">So, (sighs) he has to go through a primary care. And then, he also needs a primary care. But we couldn\u2019t have this primary care. So, we got another one. At least, we figure, we just go to the Portsmouth because they would at least have records. I mean, even just getting records back and forth to this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">doctor? No one was responding to phone calls. It was just a mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">So, just by luck, we ended up with someone at least could talk to Josh. I mean, he talked to him like a person.  Talked to me like a person. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">And gave him a pain plan that seems like a\u2014is not something that they\u2019re just throwing at him to get him out because they think he\u2019s a junkie. So, that\u2019s good. But then, I mean, even just getting these drugs is so hard. Had to get a piece of paper. Bring it to a CVS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: (sighs) You need a written script.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. But then, what the doctor had put it in wrong. So, then, I had to go back, all the way back to Cheshire. Get another piece of paper. Got to the CVS. The CVS only had two (crosstalk at 00:04:40) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:40) wait 24 hours. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve never had to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t (inaudible at 00:04:44). They don\u2019t always have some stuff available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Well, these are patches. They\u2019re (inaudible at 00:04:51) patches, so, it\u2019s like a morphine patch. And they didn\u2019t have them in the CVS. And if they could order them. And they\u2019re like, \u201cWe don\u2019t usually do that.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, I have to go to another CVS.  And then, the insurance wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">cover it. So, then, we\u2019re still trying to get these patches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">This whole story, I guess, leads up to why I was feeling really frustrated. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: And I was just so tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:05:12) rightly so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: So, I guess, last time, you had said that you think that my super-exhaustion is just anxiety in another form, which has been really helpful to think about, because, I mean, yesterday, I would\u2019ve thought I would\u2019ve been so worked-up that I would want to just go running or something. But instead, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">I just\u2014all I wanted to do was just take a hot shower and put on pajamas. (chuckles) And I was trying not to feel bad about that, because it was kind of a confusing thing, but\u2014and I basically spent the entire weekend tired and on the couch in my pajamas, as a result of other exhausting things. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: I mean, it sounds like yesterday was a really frustrating day. And to want to be done with the day and be with pajamas and take a hot shower and let go of the\u2014let go of all that frustration, it seems normal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: It was just not the way I usually feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It was surprising to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: It was surprising. And I felt like (crosstalk at 00:06:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Because normally, that stuff, you feel like would work\u2014get you worked-up and angry and angsty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Even just having to drive back and forth across Providence (inaudible at 00:06:26) would usually get me furious. And instead, I mean, I just did it [to get] (ph) it done. It didn\u2019t make me worked-up, (chuckles) which is good (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You were in crisis-solving mode, which you often feel more calm in the midst. Not necessarily crisis, because none of that stuff was a crisis, but it was like it needed to be faced and addressed right then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: No, I mean, this is definitely different than I usually would feel, so . . . it was good, but, I guess, if it\u2019s also the anxiety, then, that I\u2019m just exhausted, then, that\u2019s not good.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or not, I guess. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, it\u2019s how you felt. And it seems like it makes sense in that moment. Right? After having a day where you solved a lot of problems and ran back and forth a lot, to me, I mean, take anxiety out of it. It sounds like you were tired at the end of the day and wanted to relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t sound crazy. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Right. I mean, I did\u2014I really did try not to think too much about it. I was feeling really frustrated the end of last week. I had one hour, I didn\u2019t sleep very\u2014really well. I\u2019m not sure why. And Josh was having tons of trouble with his pain. And (sighs) doctors were driving everyone crazy. Oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">he also called my dad to ask if my dad any oxycodone left from his surgery.  And my parents are convinced that he is an addict. (chuckles) And they called me. And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think he was in a lot of pain and just desperate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">My brother\u2019s friend does medical marijuana. I was trying to figure out how to get him a medical marijuana card. I mean, it was just all\u2014it was \u201cTwilight Zone.\u201d Like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get this fixed?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">So, on Friday night, my friend was having a party. And I didn\u2019t ever intend to go. But I went out to dinner with a speaker who had come to Yale. And had a glass of wine, which basically just (chuckles)\u2014and then I just was like, \u201cScrew it. I\u2019m just going to go crazy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Having the glass of wine basically just\u2014what was the end of that sentence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Made me go from feeling, \u201cI just want to give up and hide in the corner,\u201d to, \u201cI\u2019m just going to do whatever I want,\u201d which is go to that party, because that\u2019s what everyone else is doing that I know.  And that\u2019s what the normal thing to do is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Mmm. And you want to be normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Yeah. And then, I went to this party (sighs) and just danced like a crazy person for like three hours, which was great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Why was it like a crazy person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I just didn\u2019t even care who was at the party or what was happening. I just wanted to do dance. Dragged a couple of my friends to dance.

And then, of course \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And not being responsible for a little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Right. (inaudible at 00:10:18) and I keep doing this. (chuckles) This is not the first time this has happened. And then, I of course had paid for it a lot the entire rest of the weekend, which also didn\u2019t help my exhaustion. It was like a\u2014any energy, pent-up frustration I have was all let out <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">in those two hours. And then, I went back to being exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And then you were really exhausted. So, I guess, what we want to separate is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: what feels like exhaustion that feels appropriate to the moment and hiding, withdrawing-type exhaustion that maybe is avoidance of anxiety, rather than truly just being tired and wanting to rest. I think that\u2019s what we need to figure out a way to distinguish between, so that you know whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">it\u2019s, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m tired after a long, frustrating day,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m tired after not sleeping well at night,\u201d versus, \u201cI\u2019m anxious and I\u2019m channeling into, \u2018I\u2019m hiding from the world in my pajamas.\u2019\u201d  Right? It\u2019s not always bad to want to hang out in your pajamas. But sometimes, it\u2019s a signal that you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A52\">actually avoiding stuff, rather than just responding to your normal physiological cues of being tired. We want to know when it\u2019s one thing and when it\u2019s the other. And it sounds like you have both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it\u2019s good that hiding used to be more like what I did most of the time. Or all the time. And now, I still kind of want to, but sometimes I fight it and go completely the opposite direction. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Mmm. How in control do you feel of what you\u2019re\u2014how you\u2019re responding to situations? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well, in general, I feel like I have to control my life so much to feel good that I\u2014I don\u2019t know. I just try to not\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014I just chose to not control it or I don\u2019t know. Maybe that is controlling. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. [In a sense] (ph) you feel like so much of your life has to be tightly controlled in order to be okay. And then, sometimes, you just do the opposite. Have to do the opposite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: And not care at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Which is not something I used to do. (chuckles) And I think I said this last time I did this, I\u2014there was huge consequences. I don\u2019t sleep at all, generally, because I feel awful. I feel terrible for at least a day or two after. And it\u2019s not even because I had too much to drink. It\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">just because I couldn\u2019t sleep, because I was just\u2014I don\u2019t know.

I guess I was so still worked-up and overly excited. Sometimes, I feel like a five-year-old that\u2019s overstimulated. (chuckles) Or my dog when he\u2019s up in the middle of the night for no reason and he looks at me at me, he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, is it playtime?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

But regulating your sleep is really important. And there\u2019s so much of this stress of your life that\u2019s out of\u2014is out of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">your control. You can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen with Josh. And if there\u2019s going to be some sort of crisis. You can\u2019t predict if your dogs are going to wake you up at 4:00 a.m. But being able to control\u2014having as regular of a sleep pattern as possible without having to give up your socialization <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD2\">and your life completely. I mean, there\u2019s a lot that you have had to give up. So, being able to go out and dance isn\u2019t really hurting anybody, except if it then interferes with an entire weekend (inaudible at 00:14:58).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So, if there\u2019s a\u2014if it\u2014if there\u2019s a safe way for you to be able to recoup some of the sleep loss faster . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not a junkie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: No, I know.

I don\u2019t know. In a way, the not being able to sleep, I mean, I was pretty angry on Saturday. And frustrated. And Josh was really excited to go to where he works. Or used to work. Or still kind of works. He hasn\u2019t been there since he left. He hasn\u2019t been there since he went to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB1\">hospital. And it was a big\u2014it was super-sale at the shop. And so, he asked me if I would take him. And he wanted to get there like first thing in the morning. So, he basically dragged me out of the house. And I had to pull myself together. And then, we stayed at the bike shop. I (inaudible at 00:15:58) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB2\">sit at the shop for like three hours while he talked to everyone who was there. And he\u2019s trying to take back some of his work (crosstalk at 00:16:08).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">Anyway.

And then, so, we did all that. And then, he begged me to take him to the mall again, because he was still feeling good. I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s feeling good. If I\u2019m feeling like death, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t want to make him go back home. (chuckles) So, I took him to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">the mall, where I just got more and more angry and frustrated. And anyway, all this leads up to us \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Angry at\u2014does it feel like it\u2019s directed anywhere?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: No. He can tell. He was\u2014kept asking me if I was mad at him. And I was trying just to be quiet, so I didn\u2019t just (chuckles) start screaming for no reason. So, no, it was just anger that I was\u2014I had basically ruined what could\u2019ve been a lovely day.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: So, you want to find a way to\u2014instead of swinging from one extreme to the other \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: find a way to be able to have both.

(chuckles) Realizing your limits, maybe. Right? So, being able to let go and dance and have a good time, but what would happen if you did it for two hours instead of three?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: Oh. At the time, I didn\u2019t want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: I just basically just danced until I was \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Until you were so exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: because now, I want to fall asleep, now. But anyway, it was a\u2014it was okay, until I was really hungry.  And Josh had promised\u2014he was looking at where we could go to dinner. And he seems really excited about it. And then, he started to have a lot of pain. And he started to get really upset. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">And I just didn\u2019t have the energy to help, so I just figured I would go home.

Disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: And not even disappointed. I was just hungry. (chuckles) So, this all led\u2014so, we got home, and I forget exactly how we ended finally having a huge fight. But, in a way, it was almost good. We haven\u2019t really had a fight, just a silly fight, because (inaudible at 00:18:44) trying to be nice. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Right. So, it actually felt a little bit more normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, anyway, this whole being reckless and being exhausted thing kept me from holding back, I guess. And we had a huge fight, which started out as something really stupid.  But then, we ended up actually talking about real things, so\u2014and he seemed to be able to handle it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: He may be not as fragile\u2014I mean, you\u2019ve been really working to control what you say, what he perceives, what you\u2019re doing, to try to protect him and take care of him.

We resolved it, sort of. We went to bed. And then, the next day, I don\u2019t know if I didn\u2019t sleep well or what. But the next day, those things were still kind of not so great. And then, we had another fight. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">(chuckles)  This time, about his mom. And I don\u2019t know. This sounds weird. It felt so good. We went through all the rest of the stuff that we hadn\u2019t\u2014we were so tired, we didn\u2019t go through. Yeah.

And it just feels like more work for me.

And if he were really healthy or healthier than this right now \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: then, setting that as a goal and keeping that as something that\u2019s important would make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: And that, I mean\u2014I also love this about him, because he has such dreams that I\u2019m not always good at. And he has dreams that are\u2014that will cause me some distress to even think about. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:23:32) picture a thing like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: I mean, he\u2019s much better at thinking of the fun things to do or\u2014without stress, but then, when he asks\u2014I don\u2019t know. And sometimes, I get upset when he asks so much. When it\u2019s not really necessary. I feel taken advantage of, I guess, so, it was nice to be able to yell at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">The next thing we fought about, though, was that his mom keeps showing up at the house unannounced.  And I\u2019m really trying to set up more boundaries there, because it\u2019s really, really upsetting to me when it\u2019s like a Sunday morning at 9:30 and I just woke up and she just walks in the door. And maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201351\">Josh knew she might come, but, I mean, I would never show up without calling, even. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">So, she does this on Sunday morning. And I\u2019m in the kitchen. And I don\u2019t come out and say, \u201cHi,\u201d to her, because I hear her voice and I\u2019m just furious. Suddenly, all of this anger, because I still haven\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep at this point. I was just furious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">(sighs) And then, she leaves. No one says anything to me. And then, Josh comes in. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come say, \u2018Hi,\u2019 to (inaudible at 00:24:44)?\u201d I just lost it. Because I\u2019ve asked him before to please ask her to call ahead. I don\u2019t know. It hasn\u2019t gotten through. I guess he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">unreasonable and hasn\u2019t quite said to her (crosstalk at 00:25:02) that makes her understand that it\u2019s not a reasonable thing to do.  And I want to feel like I have my own house, so . . . (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It sounds like you and Josh have different expectations of what\u2019s considered reasonable for a family member to come by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: Well, if she was coming to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">THERAPIST: And you guys need to agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah. She was coming to bring him things that he had asked for. And I also worry sometimes that he takes advantage of her, because she would\u2019ve gone to get the [meat share] (ph) because he asked her to. And she wouldn\u2019t have said no, (inaudible at 00:25:34) biggest problem. He\u2019s probably been <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201411\">able to do this with her, so . . . (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">So, anyways. We had a huge fight about his mom, because\u2014I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s been really, really helpful and wonderful. But at some point, there\u2019s got to be\u2014I have to be able to set\u2014it\u2019s really hard to set up a boundary when someone\u2019s being wonderful. It\u2019s a really difficult thing to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And it\u2019s a tricky situation, because you do\u2014you need her help. And you need her presence right now. But you guys also need to be an independent, adult couple and have your private space respected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: Getting on the same page with Josh about, so, what does that\u2014what would the\u2014what would it feel like to have your space as your home feel respected? And is that a 15-minute warning? Like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m stopping by\u201d? Or having her needing to call and say, \u201cWhen would be a good time for me to drop <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201491\">this stuff off?\u201d But clearly, it\u2019s not okay for you to have her just drop in. Are there certain hours when that would be okay, but not before 10:00 on a Sunday and not after \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s an apartment. There\u2019s one room. Or two rooms and (sighs) I don\u2019t know. It makes feel a little crazy. And, in fact, Josh has told me that I can be just really, really mean, sometimes.  (sighs) Which is something my mom has said to me, before. That I can be really, really mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Do you recognize when you\u2019re being what they\u2019re calling really, really mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: I mean, yeah. (chuckles) Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m trying not to totally go in there and start screaming at his mom. So, I\u2019m trying not to do what I really want to do, which would be awful. But it still ends up being mean or rude or (sighs) something like that. (sighs) And I think that\u2019s because I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F1\">been sort of trying to be okay with something I\u2019m not okay with (crosstalk at 00:27:39).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2014E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not okay, right. And you\u2019re feeling really resentful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: Right. And then, but it would take a little bit of meanness or something to stop it right away and then, avoid future meanness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like it\u2019s going to take some straightforward discussions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs) Which is really hard, so\u2014but anyway. It helps that I can do that with Josh, now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I think that\u2019s the most important place to be able to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, a lot of these things, we don\u2019t agree about, especially with his mom and my parents. (chuckles) And if we can\u2019t fight about it, if he\u2019s in so much pain and miserable that he just starts crying the minute I need to talk about anything, even if it\u2019s not about that? So, now we <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B1\">can. So, that\u2019s really\u2014feels really good, which \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Or, at least there\u2019ll be times when you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: And it may be that there\u2019s still days when he can\u2019t. But it sounds like there are definitely times when you can have these kinds of talks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he\u2019s still definitely up and down. Sometimes, he\u2019s just completely [in pain] (ph) world, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Right. And when he\u2019s in pain world, you can\u2019t have these kinds of conversations. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not allowed to have the feelings, but you can\u2019t have those kinds of conversations when he\u2019s in active pain.  Or figuring out what the level is that he can tolerate and still function <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201651\">in his way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: But I think you don\u2019t have to agree on what\u2019s reasonable and what\u2019s not reasonable. What you do need to agree on is what are the rules of your house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Because you may always have a different perspective on whether it\u2019s reasonable for a mother, a mother-in-law type to stop by unannounced. He may always think that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s maybe the way he was brought up. And you may always think that\u2019s completely unreasonable. What you need to agree <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D1\">is like, \u201cOkay. What\u2019s going to be\u2014what\u2019s our stance on what we can both tolerate?\u201d And that\u2019s going to have to be a compromise somewhere in the middle. I think staying away from words like, \u201cright,\u201d or \u201cwrong,\u201d and, \u201creasonable,\u201d and \u201cunreasonable,\u201d makes it more helpful to\u2014because those have such <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D2\">a sense of critique and evaluation in them.  But if you can keep it straightforward, like, \u201cWe need to (ph) set a rule for our house that we can both live with,\u201d and it helps you to not feel so mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess a lot of these (inaudible at 00:30:17) are very\u2014are coming from very different places (inaudible at 00:30:21). I guess this is probably why my mom thinks I\u2019m mean. I feel so strongly that it can\u2019t, just can\u2019t be the way it is, because I will just lose my mind. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: Well, and maybe it can\u2019t. You can\u2019t live with that. You can\u2019t live with it being the expectation that she can show up whenever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: Right. And then, Josh gets really defensive, I guess. And I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a compromise. I can\u2019t have it like that. And that\u2019s probably why I end up being kind of mean. I mean, I don\u2019t know if a compromise\u2014I just need some kind of notice. Any.

And if you can separate, \u201cI can\u2019t tolerate that,\u201d from, \u201cThat\u2019s crazy that you think I should be able to tolerate it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I do think it\u2019s crazy.

I totally understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re totally allowed to feel that, just as he\u2019s allowed to feel like it\u2019s a reasonable expectation that you should be comfortable with her just stopping by whenever. It\u2019s just you come from very different places in your perspective. You\u2019re both right in that regard. However, getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D1\">on the same time, what\u2019s going to make it best for you guys as a couple? Clearly, this isn\u2019t. You\u2019re not going to all of the sudden decide that you\u2019re totally cool with that. And he\u2019s not going to totally decide that there should be three days of written notice before \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">THERAPIST: which might make you feel really comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">THERAPIST: So, deciding that yeah, you\u2019re both right, in terms of what your expectation is. But that expectation doesn\u2019t\u2014can\u2019t coexist. So, can you set up an expectation that at least you can both count on? So, he can learn to expect that yep, Mom\u2019s going to have to give some sort of notice.  You get <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201851\">clear with what kind of notice you\u2019re getting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">CLIENT: Yeah. And these kinds of things take us a lot time to really get on the same page about. But I\u2019m glad we can at least [talk about it] (ph). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">THERAPIST: What do you think you would\u2014what would you be able to tolerate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">CLIENT: Oh, from her? Yeah. It totally depends on my state of mind. I mean, if I wasn\u2019t exhausted and in a terrible mood already, she could\u2019ve shown up and I probably would\u2019ve just\u2014whatever, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">THERAPIST: But she can\u2019t know what mood you\u2019re in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">CLIENT: Right.

It\u2019s just really helpful. I mean, she was there on Friday, or I would never have come out and done crazy things.

And she doesn\u2019t seem to mind that I do these things. I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019ve never had someone\u2014maybe other people are better at it or other people are equally as bad at setting boundaries.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">Oh, okay. This was worse, because she had yelled at me for illegal parking. She was really upset that I had parked illegally, because I was dropping Josh off and she was afraid I was going to get towed. We\u2019ve gotten towed so many times and she\u2019s had to help us out. So, she was mad. And so, I told Josh. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB1\">I was like, \u201cShe seemed awfully mad,\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, we put her through a lot with towing cars.\u201d (chuckles) And he had told her that I had said that she was mean. That was also part of the fight was that he thought he was explaining to her that it just\u2014at the moment, it\u2019s like he tells <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB2\">her\u2014or, she tells him things, I tell him things.  And it\u2019s a disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Mmm.

But it\u2019s making things worse. (chuckles) So, but I still haven\u2019t been able to just talk to her directly. I mean, I\u2019ve tried a couple times, and she just\u2014about some serious things and she just shut down. And then, she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AF1\">not really good at it, either, so, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be an ongoing struggle forever and ever (chuckles) to talk to her, but point being that I can talk to Josh about it now, so, that\u2019s a step, at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, (crosstalk at 00:35:42).

I think if there are two themes of the day, it\u2019s figuring out what your limits are and finding places where you can let go of a little bit of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B11\">control, to be a little bit more flexible or less limited.  And how careful and controlled you need to be, so that when you let go, it doesn\u2019t need to feel so drastic. And not like you have to get out every ounce of freedom \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B3\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B5\">THERAPIST: and ability to let go of some of the responsibilities, because you feel like it\u2019ll\u2014it\u2019s like you\u2019re binging on freedom when you let go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re never going to get it again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">CLIENT: Well, and Friday was also the day that my mom had called because she thought Josh was trying to get drugs from anywhere. And I just also just didn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore. Well, I guess that\u2019s the same thing as wanting (inaudible at 00:36:38).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. You don\u2019t want to have to have the responsibility, which makes sense. You have so much responsibility heaped on you right now. And sometimes, you\u2019d like a huge break from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">CLIENT: But again, last week, when you said the\u2014it\u2019s still anxiety if I\u2019m\u2014even if I cannot\u2014it\u2019s really helpful.  I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Well, if it\u2019s useful framework to think about it \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">THERAPIST: hold onto it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:37:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, because the point of me saying that was that some of the same things that feel helpful when you have that kind of vibrating anxiety could also still help you feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Right? That was my point. And, yeah, so, taking advantage of the techniques that work, I guess, to help you find equilibrium. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m still not doing a good job with that. I\u2019m still trying to get a piano. I still can\u2019t seem to sell anything. (chuckles) I haven\u2019t quite given up. But I haven\u2019t been able to\u2014this morning was the first time I\u2019ve run in like a week. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do any exercise for days. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF1\">I just didn\u2019t care, I guess. And I was really tired and didn\u2019t feel like trying. (chuckles) But I didn\u2019t have anything else, really, to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D1\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:37:58) as a replacement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3\">CLIENT: I mean, luckily, at work, it\u2019s a distraction enough.

And sometimes, the weather doesn\u2019t get me down so much that I can\u2019t go out to a yoga class or something. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t feel the need to let anything go, which is why I usually need to exercise. And maybe it would\u2019ve helped anyway, made me a little more energetic. But I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB1\">couldn\u2019t even . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But, I mean, also listening to your body. When your body says, \u201cI want to take a hot shower and lay on the couch\u201d? You can do that. Trust in yourself a bit. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling, then, that\u2019s\u2014a hot shower is definitely on the list of things that people recommend for dealing <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD1\">with anxiety. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">CLIENT: Is it? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (chuckles) Yeah, absolutely. Heat, warmth, very soothing. But it\u2019s also a way just to transition. Right? We talked about just getting yourself to move from a place\u2014that like if you\u2019re feeling stuck in a mood, then, just doing anything to help you transition and move out of that to something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E3\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E5\">THERAPIST: And a hot shower? Sometimes just even changing clothes? That can just be a way to transition. Like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m getting myself unstuck.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, I guess, it\u2019s when you said that the same things can help\u2014I still\u2014I\u2019m lacking motivation sometimes when I don\u2019t have anxiety. And I don\u2019t want to just give up because I feel so tired. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say, exactly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">THERAPIST: But you can take a break when you feel so tired. And it\u2019s not giving up. It doesn\u2019t have to be permanent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EB\">CLIENT: Well, it was good, in a way, that it didn\u2019t cause me anxiety to be so tired (inaudible at 00:40:13). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. And that\u2019s when discerning whether it\u2019s tired avoidance\u2014right?\u2014and maybe\u2014and when you\u2019re avoiding going out or going to work, then, you do want to push against that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EF\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F1\">THERAPIST: And being able to tell when it\u2019s tired like, \u201cI need a break and I\u2019m going to honor my body\u2019s signal of wanting to rest for a bit.\u201d So, being able to see if you can sit with the feeling for long enough to discern which one it is. And then, respond appropriately. If you\u2019re avoiding something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201F11\">all right. Take some time to sit with that. And then, ask yourself to approach whatever it is that you\u2019re avoiding. And if you\u2019re tired, take some time to sit. And let yourself relax. And maybe you won\u2019t be so tired after a little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Actually, I haven\u2019t panicked as much about anything since the bachelorette party. I was so anxious about going to it. I felt like I just wanted to stay home, because it was easier and it was definitely avoiding. But then, ever since that bachelorette party, I\u2019ve been ignoring the consequences <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201F31\">of acting a little crazy. (chuckles) Because I don\u2019t even want to bother being anxious. I just want to\u2014and it\u2019s (inaudible at 00:41:38)\u2014it\u2019s always very spontaneous. I need to find some other way. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Well, I think you want to find a way to be able to be spontaneous and let go. And recover a little bit faster, so it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2014the\u2014find ways to help yourself after, so that the consequences don\u2019t feel so severe. My guess is most people at that party felt tired the next day.  It <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201F51\">was probably more severe for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F7\">CLIENT: (sighs) Well, even at the bachelorette party, watching everyone sleep in. I was up like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, right. That helps them recover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FB\">CLIENT: (sighs) Ugh, it\u2019s so frustrating. (sighs) So, I know that this is not something that\u2019s good for me and everyone else can do this for obvious reasons. Because they can sleep in. Even if it\u2019s just staying up too late and not even partying or doing anything else. (chuckles) But even just staying <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201FB1\">up too late last night, couple hours, was detrimental. And sometimes, I want to just rebel against that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FD\">THERAPIST: I can understand that. Not want to have to be so tightly controlled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FF\">CLIENT: But usually, it makes me hide. (chuckles) But I haven\u2019t been, I guess, since the bachelorette party. I\u2019ve just been accepting the consequences, I guess. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20201\">THERAPIST: Mmm. I think it\u2019s part of the process. Right? Because what we want you to be able to do is live a\u2014live your life and actually have some spontaneous and uncontrolled moments, because otherwise, it\u2019s going to feel really boring. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20203\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20205\">THERAPIST: And figure out how to do that in a way that doesn\u2019t have such drastic consequences for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20207\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess even getting back just a little piece of my boyfriend is helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20209\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s not so much that you\u2019re seeking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2020B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2020D\">THERAPIST: When you get back a little bit of him, it\u2019s fewer limitations on you and I think some of what you\u2019re looking for. Not to have to always be so in control and the one who\u2019s responsible for everything. If he can be actually responsible for dealing with his feelings or his sadness or your anger <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2020D1\">at him, then you don\u2019t have to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2020F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s terrible, but his two best friends, on Saturday, one of them broke his hip.  And the other one got caught by his wife\u2014he\u2019s apparently addicted to porn. Got caught by his wife. And so, his life\u2014both of their lives basically went down the tubes. It was really nice to hear Josh on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2020F1\">phone talking to them both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20211\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Being able to be there for them. You got to see him be stronger than he thought he was, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20213\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20215\">THERAPIST: Or more himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20217\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that\u2019s happening more lately. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the universe that both of his closest friends, the two people that he would go to a desert island with or whatever, their lives have just gone off the deep end. But, yeah, I was glad that he could handle it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20216-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20216-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20219\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah. And not have his world be totally about what\u2019s going on. Yeah. I think when he went, found himself in the hospital in such dire straits, really, I mean, the whole world is revolving around Josh.  Rightly so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2021B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2021D\">THERAPIST: And it sounds like in recognizing that his world doesn\u2019t need to be revolving completely around his symptoms, his pain, his treatment right now, it\u2014there\u2019s actually room for his world to encompass his friends. Their lives. You. Your feelings. I think it\u2019s evidence that he is\u2014he really is <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2021D1\">recovering. That there\u2019s room for this stuff again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2021F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and he\u2019s been trying really hard (inaudible at 00:45:30) to give him some credit. I mean, it kind of started with an Xbox to distract himself from pain. But that\u2019s evolved. And then, that evolves into the whole wedding planning thing, which caused me a lot of stress. He wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2021F1\">to go to the mall so he could look at the suits, because he told me that when he looks at suits, he feels\u2014he can forget about the rest of it. It\u2019s like how can I not (chuckles) take him to look for suits? And then, actually being able to be there for his friends felt really, really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20221\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah. He is working hard.

But now, being able to ask him for stuff from\u2014for me was also really, really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20225\">THERAPIST: Right. I\u2019m glad that you were able to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20227\">CLIENT: (sighs) I mean, it was (sighs) there was a lot more emotion than there would\u2019ve been otherwise. And it in itself is completely exhausting. But it needs to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20229\">THERAPIST: Mmm. It sounds like it was important. It needed to happen for both of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2022B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it was good for him. I hope so. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2022D\">THERAPIST: I mean, I can\u2019t be sure, but, I mean, it sounds like he\u2019s really working to try to have some normalcy. And he\u2019s looking for ways to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2022F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20231\">THERAPIST: And part of normalcy is being able to have a range of emotions with your girlfriend. That includes being mad at her or her being mad at you sometimes. I mean, it\u2019s not fun. Nobody likes that feeling, but it\u2019s part of the safety of a good relationship is that you\u2019re allowed to feel everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20233\">CLIENT: Uh huh.  Right. Yep. Right. And when I\u2019m taking him shopping, also, it\u2019s so that he would be distracted from the pain of his whole life. And I feel like I really can, sometimes. Or in any of those situations. It\u2019s supposed to be his therapy. Right? I feel like there isn\u2019t quite room for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202331\">completely blow up, which is why I eventually did later, because I was\u2014it was building up and I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20235\">THERAPIST: Right. You couldn\u2019t do it then.

And in fact, he doesn\u2019t ask it of me as much as maybe I would like him to do. I don\u2019t know. He does really try to protect me. (chuckles) I mean, he also just thought that we were having a great time and we just weren\u2019t. (chuckles) Or, I wasn\u2019t. I was having a terrible time.  Which, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202371\">him, would\u2014made no sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20236-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20236-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561845\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20239\">THERAPIST: Right.
