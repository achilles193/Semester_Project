So... So, I'm going to keep looking (therapist affirms). The financial advisor ditched us, handed us off to one of his subordinate advisors. I'm like, \"FUCK!\" I'm like, I don't have a huge job right now, so not much probable clients, so he's busy, so he passed us off to one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">of us, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: ...other people.

He doesn't live out here anywhere; he lives in California. He's like, \"Yeah, so I was trimming down my clients that I have on this coast and like...\" He's only keeping like, the big spenders, clCharlesy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, you keep those guys who spend more money. (client affirms) Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: It's like, \"Eh!\" (sighs) (pause) (sighs) So... So it sucks, you know. Just feels weird to be ditched, for not being rich enough anymore. It kind of, it's kind of like saying like, \"Yeah, you're probably not going to be rich again.\" You know, that sort of feeling, from him. You know, like, \"Oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">no, it's not a bad failure. You're just done. You're just done.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: That, that was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I don't know, man. Like, my life seemed to be going so well, and it feels like I just destroyed everything. You know? Consistently destroyed everything. Now I'm just a dude, 36 years old, in a career that I don't like, you know, and a career I can't get out of, either; I need to stay in. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">is just my life now. You know? This is just my life. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: How long has it been now?

(pause) It's pretty close to a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that is, that can really take a toll, man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. Totally. Nobody wants to work with me. I mean nobody's hired me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: No one's hired, yeah, no one's hiring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: (sighs) So, I don't know.

Yeah, no, and it didn't take, it was, it was a lot longer than the other times.

It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: What was it, King (ph)... how many people did King have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Um... here, like 50, I think, the ones that have... but... King, it sucks to be King, I don't know. (pause) Sucks to be a lot of people, the market has changed so rapidly, the industry has changed so rapidly. A lot of people have a hard time adapting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: What about, yeah, what have you noticed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Well, gains\/games (ph) seem to be smaller and smaller, buckets (ph) are larger and larger buckets. There is really very little middle ground, you know? You need to make an independent gain with a very small theme (ph) that makes it big. (therapist responds) Or you need to be a huge monolith <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">that can risk $30 million on a game (therapist affirms), you know, but in an established genre, you know, sequel of something else. (pause) So that's where we find ourselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It is a different industry, then? Than when you started?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible) you asking questions is still the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Asking questions is still the same. I mean, (inaudible) is still the same. (pause) Just need a chance to do it somewhere. (therapist responds) It's all I need (therapist affirms)... is a chance to do it somewhere. (pause) We'll see... we'll see. In the meantime, I don't know. Try to stay creative, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">try to monetize creative things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (sighs) Well, I don't sleep; I stay up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Is that, did you stay up last night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, not as late as usual, only up till 2:00 or 3:00. Like, I have this entire other life that exists around my time with Ginny (yawns), where it is like this fear (ph) bubble in every day, because I'm up for hours after she goes to bed, and I'm alone all day. So it's just this period of time <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">where... people aren't around, you know. Just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: How do you find, yeah, you're alone all day and then she comes home and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: I don't know; sometimes it's a little stressful. It's like, \"Oh, now there is somebody here. I feel like I should interact with you,\" but like... You know, you're still in your decompression stage after work, so that's fine. But I'm then, not sure like, kind of, we started doing something, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">know... we're going to eat dinner soon, probably. How's that going to happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: (affirms) What time does she usually get off work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Um, it really depends, you know? I mean, some days she comes home at noon and works from home. (therapist affirms) You know? Some days, she's home at like, 4:00, others she gets home about 5:00 or 6:00, you know, so it all varies. She's in control of her schedule, for the most part, except that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">people don't die on schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: So she might be called in or something? (client affirms) Or somebody... she gets called into work? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Not (inaudible) (blocked). She had an older man grab both her breasts the other day. Pretty old and senile; he was also pretty deaf. See, if they lean down to his ear and really shout to get noise in, he kind of lured her in and went for the double grab. And she was like, \"Man!\" Old man...

He's a Haitian, he's like, \"I don't want this fucking white bitch in here!\" And she's like, \"Some white bitches speak French!\" In French, because she speaks French.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: She (chuckles) said that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah.

She's, you said she needs to decompress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: She needs to decompress. She's had a long day, you know? She usually needs a hug, but then also doesn't want to talk for a little bit, you know? So (yawns) it's like, okay. I've been alone for... hours and hours, since our (ph) night before and (therapist affirms) the entire day and... I'm going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">to be like, \"Here is stuff that's happened!

It gets very hard sometimes, when she... When it gets the worst, she doesn't talk and she puts on this mask of normalcy, but it's totally fucking irritating, because it's so obviously fake. And it's like, I don't even want to interact with her when she's like that (therapist responds), <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">you know? (therapist affirms) Because she (inaudible) want interaction anyway, so it was like... you know, so I'm like, so you know like, it's like, \"I'm here for you.\" She's like, \"Oh, and I'm here for you.\" I'm like, \"Jesus Christ!

It's... (client affirms) She doesn't want to upset you or something like that... by being distracted or being sad or... yeah. Bringing her work <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">home with her... (client affirms) And she must know that you're, you know, dying for interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, she knows.

Like, she still wanted to go do stuff. Like, \"Let's go for a hike in the woods. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">Let's just, you know, go to Walden Pond and like, walk around, you know. Let's just... Let's just like, fucking do stuff.\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: He didn't want to go anywhere, though, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: No, he wants to stay home and play with (inaudible) and pretend like he can't do anything, because he doesn't have money to go to the movies; definitely can't do anything. It's like, \"Come on, man!\" (sighs) You used to try to try. Have you tried trying?\" \"I read it in a book.\" \"Are you sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">it was a book? Are you sure it wasn't nothing?\" So... (pause) (sighs) Smoking on my friend's vaporizer was fantastic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: On Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's a great, great device. You're not getting it like shitty smoke or anything. It doesn't irritate my, you know, gastrointestinal tract or anything. It's not smoke, it's just vapor. (therapist responds) So that's nice. It's cleaner, too, more clear headed, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: The high is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is nice. It was real nice. (pause) Yeah, if I ever a card (ph), I'm going to get a vaporizer. (pause) Yeah. (sighs) He's a good candidate for it, strapped (ph), you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Charles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: No, Barry (sp), sorry, the friend with the vaporizer?

(client affirms) (pause) Yeah, and so are you! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's a different kind of pain, isn't it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well. It's your brain...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: I don't know, if somebody gave it to me, I'll... Totally, I would go to my doctor like, \"Would you do this?\" Like, \"Yeah, I'm the only doctor who will.\" Seems like a very popular doctor. (therapist affirms) (pause) (sighs) He may have (ph) absolutely less than three months, maybe four.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, yeah. I guess, you know, you talking about Ginny and you. You know, it's kind of like, among the other things that being out of work has meant, it's been like, this element of your relationship has been... yeah, it's been harder. When she gets home and she's, you know, worn <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C71\">out or something and you're really wanting, needing some interaction with her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was free (ph). And usually, when I'm working, she gets home before I do. You know, so she has space to herself. (yawns) So... I don't know. She might come for lunch today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And I get a feeling, too, that you try not to be a burden upon her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: That you try not to put that on her in some way (client affirms), that you'd burn her out or something or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't want to, you know. So... Still, who knows? (pause) Just run around tired. Ah, it's the weed, then I'll be out of weed today, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559993\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: (pause) It's the weed; yeah, what is...? The fatigue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: I'm tired, yeah. (therapist affirms) (pause) Barry was like, \"Hey, I'm going to give you a little, like a little bit of a buzz, like a bowl full.\" I'm like, \"Thanks.\" I'm like, \"That's going to last me for an entire day and a half.\" Like, I'm extremely conservative with it. It was great, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">know. (pause) So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: But it eases this, all, I mean, certain things... What have you felt like in the last two, couple of days of (inaudible) around in it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: I love, I love weed. I love being high (therapist affirms), you know like, it's just better, in many cases, than the alternative. Which is, well, the alternative is very same-y (ph), you know? So like, so what's every day like? It's like every day! I do not feel as smart as I used to be. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">it takes the edge off the mania some. I don't get faster, I get just creative bursts, you know. So... Just kind of... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And as you're (inaudible) make those kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: That's because, yeah, it's like that's with my other day, I was in that role, right? You know? And, whereas weed, it's like, \"Oh, okay.\" Things are a little brighter, you know, feel more creative, can pop out more creative work (therapist affirms), so... Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: It's another, it's another kind of damage of the, of being out of work, too, is that you don't have that feedback of being at work and feeling like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: (inaudible) (therapist affirms) I'm sorry; can I use your bathroom? (therapist affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">[pause 00:19:44 to 00:23:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">Want a drink of water there? (therapist affirms) (pause) Barry and Helen (sp) have this, the day I went to use their bathroom, go to wash my hands, there is no soap, just like, a bottle of Purel. I was like, I'm like... \"This will do, this will do, but... I wish I had some soap!\" Oh, well... Different <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E51\">people's houses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">They have these two puggles who are super crazy hyper, for the first like, 20 minutes that you're in their house. They're like, standing up and like, \"Can I get at you, can I get at you?\" So I just ignore them for 20 minutes, and they're like, \"I get to you! It's you! You're a man and you smell like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">Hank, our best friend, Hank and...\" After 20-30 minutes they get pretty insistent. You try to stand (inaudible), they get up onto you, you're like, \"No, you can't get up on me!\" (therapist responds) So I just do this thing, where I like, put one like, one finger's on back of their neck, and just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E72\">\"Stop it! Stop it!\" And then they just, slowly there is like, they spin, turnaround, and sit down between like, my knees, one sitting on the (inaudible) (blocked). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Boom! There you go! Like, that's all they really need is a gentle hand on the scruff of the neck and they were like... I'm a bigger dog!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Alpha dog!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, just... just chill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Just chill out, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: But it takes them 20 minutes to get to the point where they can do that. Because they're like, \"It's you, it's you!\" (therapist responds) But they're...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: But it kind of settles their excitement, or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and like, the youngest one, is fucking stupid. It's amazing how dumb she is. I mean, my dog is not very smart, but he is much smarter than these two other puggles. He loves them! We drop him off there, he gets really excited whenever we drop him off, for like, to stay for a weekend or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F71\">something when we go away, because he loves being with those guys. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559993\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">(pause) Reminds me of ((not com)). So, you know, every ((not com)), I go every year. Ginny is actually thinking of ditching out this year. She wants to know like, how I would feel about her ditching out. I'm having a difficult time with that, because I realize that a big part of what makes it possible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">for me to go on this five-hour car ride, to stay in this place for five days, is the fact that she comes with me. (therapist affirms) And I don't want to at all be like... \"I don't know, come along! Spend vacation days on stuff that's not really a vacation for you,\" you know. So (sighs)... On the one <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F92\">hand, I feel like, \"Well, you don't have to go. Totally, you don't have to go,\" and then try not to ditch on ((not com ing)). (therapist affirms) And I love ((not com ing)).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Does she know about...you know, you need her to be with you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: No, I haven't mentioned it, because I just realized it, and I don't want to bring it up, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Well, because it's just... because then she'll go, you know? Then she'll be like, \"Oh, well, then I'll go!\" (therapist affirms) And I'm like... like, but I don't want you to go and waste vacation days, if you're not going to enjoy yourself. Like, that's not what I want for you, you know? (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">affirms) Despite the fact that I really like... seeing you there. (therapist affirms) Even though I see her for bits and pieces, right? We'll both go off and do our own thing, and she swims or reads...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: But her being there is just of immense importance, I mean... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Well, it makes it easier to drive five hours (therapist affirms), you know? It's more comfortable. I'm less afraid, most of the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) And feel that if you told her, it would just be, she'd feel (snapping fingers), I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Makes her feel obligated to go, and she always does stupid stuff like that. You know, like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: What if she did? What if she felt obligated to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: She goes into uncomfortable situations, because she thinks she might make something easier for someone else (therapist responds), which always makes her a great hospice worker. But... in life, it's just really burdensome. It's like, \"Great! Now, if I have any sort of need, you're going to drop <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">everything and fill it, so I can't tell you when I have needs or else you'll drop everything and fill them, as stupid as that is.\" You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And largely because you feel like you don't want to put that on her, you don't want to make her do something that she feels obligated to do or this other thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. And so we just (inaudible). (therapist affirms) Yeah, I (inaudible), I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, it puts you in a tricky bind then, because you really... because what do you do, then, with these, you either kind of... have to keep them to yourself, or if you tell her, then she feels thrown into this, \"I have to make it right\" kind of thing. (client affirms) (pause) Why <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">doesn't she want to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559993\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Eh! She doesn't really play a lot of the games that we're playing or... there is a lot of drinking and loudness, and she's not really into that. It's not like a lot of the stuff that she does there is sort of geared to her, you know. (therapist affirms) So... So... (pause) Yeah, I don't understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">that. (pause) I love ((not com ing)), actually, I love it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. (pause) Where you going?

I love the idea of knowing where I'm going to sleep, and knowing what it's like. There is room just for me and Ginny, don't have to share with anybody else. There is no weirdness. You know, just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah. Again, just to say, I mean... I don't think I know anybody in all my years that has been through as much trauma in a car as you have. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, it's probably true, right? (therapist affirms) I mean, you know... Lots of car accidents, and people just trying to hit me, and going off the road in the driver's seat, you know? (therapist affirms) I'm like, spending most of my life there. I spent most of my childhood in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">car, when I was homeschooled. We would do errands, every day, we'd go do errands. And what did that mean? It means we got in the car, she'd bundle us in the car (my sister and my brother and I), and we would just go to the mall and to other stores... and sometimes go to the DMV. It's like, every day... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: To the DMV?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, because she had to do something at the DMV or whatever, but I mean it was like, every day, we would spend the day driving around and going to places on errands. We'd stop at Burger King for lunch, and Burger King for breakfast, you know? So, for about three years, I ate mostly Burger King.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: This would be, how many days of the week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: Five!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Five days a week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: Five days a week! To the point where my brother was three, one day we didn't go on errands. He turned to me and he says, \"Why aren't we in the car?\" Every day of his life, every day of his life, we had been in the car. And it never occurred to me, until he asked me that question, that every <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D1\">day of his life was spent in the car... in a car seat, most of the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Basically, like his home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah! It's like, that's just what happens. Wake up, you get in the car (therapist affirms), and go places. At night, you come back home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: Sort of \"What the hell is going on?

(therapist responds) Cars and malls, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">THERAPIST: And what did you guys do at the malls?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">CLIENT: Wander around, go to stores and look at things, and sometimes buy things with money we didn't have, you know, with checks she knew would bounce (therapist responds), you know. (pause) With checks she knew would bounce! (pause) It's insane, right? (therapist affirms) Write checks that she knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201391\">would bounce, but she'd write them anyway. Like, \"Oh, well! That's going to bounce!\" You know, just... it was just part of everything. It was just part of everything, it's just what happens, just what your day was like. You know, you just... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20138-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20138-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559993\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no.

Yeah, no, homeschooling was a joke. Yeah. There was no homeschooling. There was nothing. There was a few days where she tried to teach us about Native Americans, because that's what she thought was really the most important thing. We learned about Native Americans. And like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201451\">she'd rather go to a Laundromat. She'd be like, \"All right, no math for you!\" And so we never did math, you know. She never made us do anything that was hard. You know, even when we were in school, it was like, \"Oh, I don't feel well.\" I wouldn't' go to school that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">In third grade... was it fourth? Or was it fifth? May have been fifth. The principal called us all in, my mother and I, he was like, \"Your kids have missed one-third of the school year.\" He was like, \"They can't keep missing school.\" It's like, they've missed one-third of the school year! Just for sick <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201471\">days. You know, he was like, \"This can't happen anymore.\" And so, in sixth grade, she pulled me out of school. (therapist responds) You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: That's what happened, okay. What would she do on the sick days? Was she actually making you sick? Or the (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I'm just, I was stressed. I just had anxieties for as long as I've been alive. I was worried about what was going to happen in school that day, because I mean... Okay, so kindergarten was great until the teacher got pregnant and it was this fat woman every day, and I stopped <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">talking. So they thought I was retarded. \"We're going to hold you back, do kindergarten again.\" They had my parents in and said, \"We believe your son is retarded and we need to review kindergarten again.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">My father and my mother, \"Well, there he goes! My son's retarded!\" My father goes, \"My son's not fucking retarded! Like, give him an IQ test.\" And they're like, \"Okay, your son's a genius, we don't have a gifted program, so... you know, he can been enrolled, re-group (ph), which were me and like, two <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D1\">other kids, which I had then immediately assumed was because I was stupid, in first grade. I was like, \"Oh, shit! Just me and two other kids in this class! Like, we must be the worst readers (therapist responds), you know, in the class.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Did you know what the other kids were reading out of (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's like, but we were in first grade. We were reading, you know, first grade books. And it is reading (inaudible), there is like, no difficulty. And that's the thing I remember, is like, thinking like, how I must be so bad at reading, but (inaudible) I can just look at words and read <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201511\">them. (therapist affirms) I remember, I was asking for things to be read to me, because this is how things were often done. Comic books, my stepfather had (ph) comic books, when I was like seven, he'd read this to me; she said, \"Read it yourself!\" And I remember just looking at it and be like, \"Oh. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201512\">Yeah. I know what this says.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20150-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20150-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559993\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Wow!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Just reading it. Like, \"Oh, okay. No, I can read this.\" You know, and I remember that realization at seven like, \"Oh, yeah! I can read! How about that?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What I'm also struck by is that there wasn't like, some sort of presence that was telling you what you were, like, that was helping you understand your world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: They didn't tell me I was smart. They didn't tell me I tested well. (therapist affirms) You know? And so I thought I was stupid. So in second grade, we probably went to four different schools for second grade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">There is this hippy con artist, convinced my mother to move out there, so we did. And he stole a bunch of our furniture, a bunch of other people's furniture. He started a thrift shop, and he took everything in the shop, and just skipped town, emptied out the entire store full of clothes and (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B1\">stuff and furniture. Just left. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">Yeah, so, and I was, so in my fourth school, and they were all at different points in math, you know? They were all doing different things. So it was very difficult. Then in fourth grade, we moved back to Hamstead, different school, The teacher, she was just mean, you know? She would like, yell at kids <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D1\">for being little babies. You know, make them cry and like, \"You're crying? You're a big baby! Babies cry!\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">Like, you know, I'd play with my ears, you know, it's a nervous tick; I've always kind of done it. You know, like... so. And (therapist responds)... she would yell at me for that. She was like, \"Look at the baby, playing with his ear!\" And every so, I would miss, I would miss a lot of days. I'd be dragged <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F1\">into the school, kicking and screaming. Like, I did not want to go. (therapist responds) You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">Some days we'd have to go, other days they'd drag me in. I hated it. I would come in and cry, basically, every single day. And... hated it! And so one day, I missed the day where she taught us long division, you know. So I come in, and everyone is doing long division. I go up to her and like, \"What <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201611\">is this? And how...\" Like, a symbol I've never seen before. I'm like, \"How do I do this?\" She was like, \"Figure it out yourself! Go do long division on your own! You've never seen this before! What is this? It's long division. That's what I've told you. Do the problems on the board.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: It was just numbers and a symbol.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: It was just numbers and a symbol. I had no idea what they mean or how they relate to each other. So I didn't do long division, just, for years. I just didn't do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: Is that right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess, at least (ph), I don't know how to do long division! And then, that's just like for years. Then in fifth grade, they taught short division. I was like, \"This is easy. Like, why don't we just always do it this way?\" It's like, this is, like, \"This is really simple! Like, Oh, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201691\">see now!\" Then it wasn't until high school, I'm like, \"Oh, fuck! Like...\" Because it was like, addition and multiplication were always so easy for me, but subtraction and division were really hard. So one day, I was like, \"Oh, they're just backwards.\" I'm like... subtraction is just multiplication in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201692\">reverse, division is just multiplication (corrects) subtraction is addition in reverse, same thing with division and multiplication. I'm like, \"Oh! These are just opposites!\" (therapist affirms) You know? So I'm like, \"Oh, now this is actually pretty easy!\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559993\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">The same thing with Algebra in high school. Struggled and struggled with Algebra. It was like, this is just so, it's x's and y's and (inaudible) abstract and there are no why for anything. You just do it over and over again; it's like, \"Here is the way to do this problem. Here is 30 of this problem. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">Do this problem 30 times.\" It's 30 different versions of the same problem. Like, I'd lose focus halfway through this, I was so fucking bored. And in long form algebra, if you lose focus, you miss a variable, you know, you're screwed. (therapist affirms) So I was like, \"Oh, I got (inaudible) (blocked).\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">THERAPIST: All it takes is one little thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and... you know, it was awful. (therapist responds) You know, and it wasn't until senior year in Physics, I'm sitting next to an exchange student. I'm totally lost and like, I memorized the formulas and they're all really cool and everything. All this doesn't make sense, but I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F1\">\"Fuck! I have to do fucking math!\" (sneezes, excuses) Sitting next to my friend from Africa, and I look at his paper, and he's fucking changes something. I'm like,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">\"What did you do?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">He was like, \"I just moved this to the other side of the equation.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">I'm like, \"Wait; what do you mean, you moved it to the other side of the equation?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">\"Well, I just reversed it and put it over here, so it was like plus x here, now it's minus x over here. It was like, and that's just how we... (therapist affirms) simplify. \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">And I was like, \"Oh!\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">And suddenly algebra made sense (therapist affirms), as soon as you put the real variables in there, I was like, \"Oh! Oh, really?\" And then, boom! Algebra was fucking simple. I was like... (therapist affirms) why couldn't (inaudible) if someone give me an application day one? (therapist affirms) You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: No, that's right. In a way, you're talking about your entire history was like, filled with these experiences. It's a bit how like Kevin needed you to kind of come in and tell him, \"Hey this is how it's done, you get out of this...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. \"This is real; do this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">THERAPIST: That's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">CLIENT: \"This is what needs to be done; you have the resources; go do that.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">THERAPIST: And that's precisely what wasn't happening for (client affirms) all those years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">CLIENT: Well, he said that was some of his dad.

Go get your license.\" (laughs) You know? It's like, \"Great. Do you need someone in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201871\">authority to tell you what to do, because you're unsure? Fine.

You know, they had stories similar to this. Some not even close to as crazy as this, that you went <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D1\">through.

She just evades it all. She can wear the mask of normalcy for a very long time. And even after sometime, people were like, \"Ah, okay.

I'm trying to figure out what I'll do without it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">THERAPIST: It's hard, it's... yeah. And, you know, sometimes you need it for a while. Sometimes, you just need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's not about her (ph), though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E5\">THERAPIST: That's the dilemma, though, isn't it? But it's also completely fair that you want her there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">CLIENT: Uh, sure, sure. That's a rational statement, is just doesn't really help the situation, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">THERAPIST: No, no, no, no, but that's the complexity of that situation. You care for her, you don't want her to feel burdened, you know that she goes through a lot. That doesn't make what you feel any less real or important.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559993\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I can certainly, if you want, I can let you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EF\">CLIENT: Uh, yeah, let me know and we'll see if it (inaudible).
