[Pause] So I took this personality test, the kind of thing that was floating around on Facebook. It wasn\u2019t very extensive. There were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">four sets of questions and each set is an either\/or with 10 categories of things or 10 sentences that you either identify with one or the other. And then it ends up giving you some kind of more of descriptive explanation rather than Briggs Meyers. It reminded me of something really similar. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">it was clearly the first series of questions kind of divided introverts from extroverts and then subsequently <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Is it related to the NEO or the five big personality traits?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It didn\u2019t seem to be but what are those ones? The INFJ kind of stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: No, that\u2019s not Briggs. Yes, this is extrovert, neuroticism, extrovert [inaudible at 00:03:56], emotional stability, extroversion, openness, consciousness and maybe agreeableness I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: It was different than that, too. I mean at least -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: They had the sort of standard model of personality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[inaudible at 00:04:23]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Oh okay. It ended up so I, I took it once kind of just like quickly and I was reading. So it ends up and it gives you these descriptions. And it says, so the first description the first time I took it was called Dreamy Idealist. [Laughs]. I said, what? So I\u2019m reading it. It\u2019s a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">too kind of and I think that it reflected the fact that I wasn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t go through each series of questions saying okay true, false, true, false. I think I was looking at it and trying to find the gist and going for it. And so I went back and took it again, just the same thing, to get back because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">it\u2019s only four questions. I did it more like actually saying which of these would I identify and then tallying up the questions and then making a choice based on how many of these I can answer true or false. And it ended up that I was, it called me Analytical Thinker. Closer, I think okay. It seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">not that the first was completely wrong but they just didn\u2019t quite like there were some parts of it that I was just I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">But in any case it is kind of, it was fascinating to see because all these tests are just a series of ways of clumping people together. So they really are kind of segments of society that can be clumped together in such a way is what the kind of suggests, right? This is a legitimate form of segregation <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">in a sense I guess. Kind of like, I mean like an illegitimate form of segregation would be based on your astrological sign. And a lot of people use that and then they\u2019ll say things like oh I\u2019m a Sagittarius and I only date Leos or whatever. How in the world does that even matter? But to some people <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">they feel like that, by the month that they were born whatever, kind of dictates the type of person they are, which I can\u2019t understand how that would even be possible. It just seems completely irrational to me. Where this at least, I mean, okay, I can see how this kind of groups people maybe in a more <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">rational way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560832\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">But still then I remembered yes but I wasn\u2019t an Analytical even though I ended up being an Analytical Thinker that wasn\u2019t the first time I took the test. And so, and there were a number of them where I wasn\u2019t 100% an Analytical Thinker; it was the because there were some of the questions that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">was almost 50\/50 on that dictated whether or not I was this Dreamy Idealist or Analytical Thinker. So I thought so maybe I am just kind of only that by a fraction of a percent and otherwise I would need kind of both of those things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">So it didn\u2019t feel to me like the test captured who I was entirely, which I mean I guess maybe it doesn\u2019t for anyone and these are just kind of like the best that you can do when you\u2019re trying to segregate people by personality traits. But it kind of I mean with my mind looking for patterns and all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">that, I mean I understand what I\u2019m doing but it still made me feel like not even this test can get who I am. [Laughs] It\u2019s supposed to be because all these people on Facebook say oh this is totally me. I don\u2019t know. [Laughs] Whoever they, whatever they end up with, which just kind of makes me think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">that you know, I don\u2019t I feel like I\u2019ve been told most of my life that I\u2019m not unique and I\u2019m not an exception to whoever\u2019s rules there are or I\u2019m not the unique little butterfly but sometimes I think I kind of am. [Laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">And I think, sometimes I think that because I want to be the exception to whatever rule is in play, and other times I think that that\u2019s just because I don\u2019t think less people get me or even they may think they do and then they, but they don\u2019t actually kind of a thing. But I\u2019m afraid that that just comes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">from my childhood also and that it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s just how I feel because my parents didn\u2019t get me and so I just kind of blanket that across everyone. But I, I mean maybe I\u2019m thinking too much about it and it\u2019s not really that big of a deal because maybe everyone\u2019s that way. Maybe what Georgia and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">I, we were talking about this a little bit last night, I think we kind of agreed that Georgia\u2019s a lot easier to get than I am; she\u2019s a bit more apparent. Doesn\u2019t have, well she\u2019s not as much of an analytical thinker as I am and I think that that kind of connection with my ID that I keep kind of going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">after has a tendency to really, I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019m more connected to it, to my self-conscious, to my or to my unconscious impulses and intentions maybe. But I\u2019d be <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: As compared to Georgia or ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes as compared to Georgia, who doesn\u2019t think about it at all and doesn\u2019t do any internal exploration. Yes. And it\u2019s just and I thought well I know Kyle (ph) typically doesn\u2019t weigh in on things but maybe he would be persuaded to say yes or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Whatever I would say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Is that your personality?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well if my hunches seem to be, seem to reflect observations that you would also make. Or if there\u2019s a better avenue approach so that we can both kind of talk about something I could try to rephrase it so it\u2019s not a direct question. But in any case it\u2019s been <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Let me just make sure I\u2019m clear what the question is. It\u2019s do I think your assessment of yourself in relation to Georgia and somewhat in relation to the personality test that you took, do I agree with your assessments, disagree, have elaborations, things like that? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560832\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes, like do you see me fitting a specific type quite well? Maybe a type of exam that I could take that I\u2019m not aware of I don\u2019t know because I am aware of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Myers Briggs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yes, Myers Briggs, I teach I think, I don\u2019t even know because it was only like a, I think there were only 20 questions; that was really short. So I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s accurate. I guess I was coming from a place of I\u2019d really like to know if I do fit into a certain type of way of thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">about personalities in the world and kind of therefore and I totally understand, at least I see how this impulse is coming from the same place that doesn\u2019t want hierarchal stretches in my life but at the same time tries to find new ones to structure my life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">So I\u2019m totally open to you saying yes, this personality tests are bullshit, but I feel like they\u2019re professional or at least that you\u2019re more proficient or specialized or expert in personality tests to say something about them in general. I mean like the utility thing because the tests here were saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">well we\u2019ll find your match or persons that are suitable for you which I didn\u2019t get into. You know, best career paths and things like that. And I did this before in college. It was this student development class where you take a bunch of tests like this and they kind of suggest certain fields of study <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">or that kind of thing. It didn\u2019t feel like it was all about productive in the end for me but I also didn\u2019t take it that seriously, or I took it pretty seriously but I felt like I biased the result at the time by having a clear, at the time, clear intention already before taking the test. I was influencing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200393\">it because I wanted to go into medicine, and so I kind of tipped the scales towards science and all of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">And I think that it just doesn\u2019t show how manipulable these tests are in the first place to me. It was you need to take this a couple of times and you need to really think about these questions as objectively as possible. But of course about you being the subject rather than kind of being persuaded <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">impulsively without examining all of the factors in a given question. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Well [pause], yes there\u2019s something in your wanting to know from me what I think about you in this regard that I think is important. I guess I think it\u2019s partly a way of trying to ward off a kind of anxiousness about not knowing yourself and maybe me not knowing you in certain ways, I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">in a number of ways either. We should actually stop. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll see you on Thursday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: See you then. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
