It\u2019s not 100% done, but it\u2019s a lot better than it was. I have a table now in the living room, but there are still a few boxes there. Unfortunately, they\u2019ll have random stuff in them so it\u2019s not just things that I can easily unpack and put in the place where they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">should go and get rid of the box. I might just have to donate those all to Good Will, or most of it. I actually have to go through and look at the contents and stuff, but I did, at least get all my clothes unpacked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: How livable do you feel like your space is now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Maybe 80%. I have two closets and one of the closets has all my yarn, but has some other stuff in it, too, now that is blocking the yarn if I actually wanted to knit stuff. There is a project that I actually wanted to work on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s too hard to get to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It\u2019s too hard to get to because then it requires my spinning wheel. There is this thing called the Knitting Olympics, in which knitters knit things during the Olympics while they\u2019re watching the Olympics. This year, because of the whole being in Sochi with all of Russia\u2019s anti-gay stuff, a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">of people are making rainbow things, so I was going to spin rainbow wool and turn it into yarn to make myself a rainbow scarf. My spinning wheel is still at Sydney\u2019s place. Somehow I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually going to happen because everything is still too inaccessible.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">the lack of color or the lack of space or what, but I was just so sad and panicked today, just being in my apartment. It was okay last night. We were at my parents\u2019 place. Last week we were at Sydney\u2019s place, which I was a little panicked because I only thought we were going to go for one day, but then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">we were over for three days so I really didn\u2019t have clothes and stuff. (sighs) Now I\u2019m panicking because I feel trapped at my place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Trapped how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (crying) I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with it, but there\u2019s just something that makes me panic whenever I\u2019m there and then I just . . . (sobbing). I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s just the lack of space. Maybe it is lack of color, but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to [get on with this] (ph?) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">day-by-day and face it.  I want out. I want to move out and sublet the place. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real possibility. It might be. I don\u2019t know if that would be a good idea, but I just am so miserable right now. Sydney thinks it\u2019s a fine place. He was there when I picked it out so he takes a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">bit of offense to that, that I don\u2019t like the place now. I keep on telling him I don\u2019t blame him; I only blame myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Well you liked it, too. You were upset that it was gone and then it came back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It was gone before I actually saw it, so I didn\u2019t actually know that I liked the place at the time when I was upset that it was gone. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s so different about it now. I guess I imagined it being bigger than it was. I don\u2019t think my setup is that different from whoever had it, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I don\u2019t know.  It\u2019s less bad when I\u2019m in the living room, even though there are boxes there, than it is when I\u2019m in my room.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: There are places where you feel more comfortable and less comfortable in the apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to fit my cat in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Does it feel different when you\u2019re alone versus there with Sydney? Have you experienced those things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve experienced both of those things. I don\u2019t know because I was mostly fine during \u2013 like he has game in the evening and I was by myself. Part of that time I was asleep and part of that time I was watching shows, but (sighs) . . . I don\u2019t know if the panic started before or after Sydney got <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">back. It was way worse today than it was yesterday. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And what were you doing before this session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Getting up, having breakfast, looking at jobs online and being too panicked to try to apply to them. I was panicking before I was trying to do that. Last night I was able to distract myself with TV shows and stuff, but today I didn\u2019t have time because Sydney actually had a phone interview with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">Facebook today that was at 1:30, so we didn\u2019t have time to watch a show or anything. (sighs) I don\u2019t know. I guess if I\u2019m going to be at work it will be okay because I\u2019m actually fine when I\u2019m at work. It\u2019s just being there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re really questioning your choice. I wonder if it\u2019s really about the space or if it\u2019s feeling insecure in your ability to live on your own or if it\u2019s just panicking about having the responsibility of having made that choice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve lived on my own before. (crying) I was on my own senior year in college. Granted, there the apartment was only $700 a month because it was West Ohio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: It was a long time ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was also a long time ago, too, now. It was also small, but for some reason it was \u2013 I guess it was better set up. The kitchen was small, but there was a microwave and there was a counter and there were shelves. There are little things. I guess I need to call the property manager. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">toilet flushes but it doesn\u2019t always catch, so the part that goes back down to seal it off doesn\u2019t always do that.  When that happens the tank fills up and it keeps on running. Sometimes jiggling the handle will fix it; sometimes it won\u2019t. There is that and there is the fact that the outlets right by <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">my bed don\u2019t work. The kitchen sink, no matter how hard you push it, it won\u2019t turn off all the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: These are little repairs that need to be made and are frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: The dripping drives me crazy. (voice breaking) Sydney can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s driving me crazy. He\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s just a leaking sink.\u201d (crying) I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s driving me crazy, but it does \u2013 maybe just because of my OCD. I don\u2019t know. He tells me I should calm down and I can\u2019t calm <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">down and I don\u2019t know how to calm down when I\u2019m still there and I just want out. (sobbing) I want to move back home with my parents and sublet the place. I\u2019ve been thinking that if I were subletting it for $1,000 a month (sobbing) I know someone would . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Take a deep for a minute. Take a deep breath.  The things that you just mentioned, I can understand why those things are very frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: You can\u2019t understand why they\u2019re making me this insane. I know my reaction is disproportionate to what\u2019s wrong. (sobbing) I recognize that, but I can\u2019t help it. [It\u2019s making me panic.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s understandable that those things are very frustrating and that the idea of having to contact the property manager and whether he says to call a plumber or whether he calls the plumber to get those things fixed, that\u2019s a hurdle for you. I know that those steps often feel like really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">big steps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m thinking if those things weren\u2019t there, I\u2019d still be going crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: What makes you think that? I\u2019m basing it based on I asked you what was . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Being in the space, the bleakness. The walls are all white and the floor is whatever wood color it is.  It\u2019s just so bleak in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Do you have things up on the walls yet, things that make it feel like home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: No. (crying) I really wish I could paint the wall blue or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Are you allowed to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so. If I could, I would. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like there are some interim steps you could take before going to the big leap of moving out of a place that you\u2019ve just moved into and trying to sublet it. To set that up is going to take some work, and there were reasons why you chose to try to get an apartment here on your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">own, rather than move in with your parents. Because that was an option then, too, and you made a decision that you thought living with your parents had more difficulties associated with it than living on your own. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I guess the other thing is also that the kitchen feels like it\u2019s too small to work in even now, so I feel like I don\u2019t have freedom choosing what to eat and I\u2019m stuck eating mac and cheese or something that doesn\u2019t have lots of ingredients. It just feels like everything is wrong with it, not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">just the things that can be fixed. It just is wrong and I chose wrong. I chose the wrong apartment and now I\u2019m suffering because I chose the wrong apartment. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: I wonder why your next thought is to leave rather than another option, which is to try and make it less wrong. There are some pieces of it that may be possible to change.  Can you change the size of the kitchen? No, but some of these other things are things that you can change, either on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">your own or with help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just afraid that the wall will still be bleak. I think putting up a picture will just draw attention to the fact that the rest of the wall is blank. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really true, but that\u2019s what it feels like right now. I like to have stuff on the walls. I\u2019m just afraid that all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">cosmetic changes aren\u2019t going to fix the overall problem of it being the wrong apartment and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with it. I\u2019ve lived in an apartment in an apartment building, even though I\u2019m used to houses. I\u2019ve lived in apartment buildings and have been fine. I\u2019ve lived in ones that are even <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">really small, like with a shared kitchen.  It can\u2019t be that much smaller than my apartment sophomore year of college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I wonder if we\u2019re looking for the problem and really the problem is the anxiety. If we just kind of rewind to the past few months or even beyond that, we keep finding a reason for why you\u2019re so uncomfortable in your space. In the house and the co-op there were lots of reasons that you became <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">really uncomfortable in that co-op situation. People weren\u2019t doing their chores, the place was dirty, the addition of the baby, and then you moved out to another apartment where there was a new set of problems \u2013 roommates that were really disrespectful and a living situation that was untenable for another <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">set of reasons.  And now you\u2019re in an apartment on your own and there is another reason why this apartment is making you so miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, but I think if I had had the apartment, like if I had been able to get the $1,500 one before it had gotten away to someone else, I think I wouldn\u2019t be feeling like this; but I\u2019m not sure. It was so big and spacious. Maybe because it\u2019s so closed off, you don\u2019t have it all together <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">and you can\u2019t see the big picture of the apartment. I\u2019m just kicking myself about taking one of the other ones that were way bigger and not in as good of a location. I feel like such an idiot for doing that, like I should have chosen a bigger apartment in a worse location.  One of them would have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">$25 a month cheaper and would have included parking. The location wasn\u2019t great and I would have to drive everywhere. Right now I\u2019m driving everywhere anyways most of the time, so it\u2019s not really . . . I don\u2019t know what I can do to make this apartment livable. Maybe there is nothing. (crying) Maybe it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200593\">is just the anxiety, but I can\u2019t make the anxiety go away. I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been trying everything. I\u2019ve tried changing my meds. I don\u2019t know how to make the anxiety go away. (sobbing) I can\u2019t stop. I can\u2019t calm down. I hate it when Sydney tells me to calm down because I feel like I can\u2019t. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200594\">telling me to do something I can\u2019t do and getting frustrated with me for not doing it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Is this what you\u2019re like at home? You\u2019re crying all the time and very easily brought to tears?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not always crying out, but sometimes I\u2019m panicky without crying; but there was some crying today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It sounds really uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: I think I just need to be institutionalized or something because I can\u2019t live on my own. (crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: I think looking at what kind of assistance you feel like you really need might be a reasonable step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to lose Sydney and I feel like if I were to move back with my parents, I don\u2019t know if the anxiety would get bad there because then I would be anxious because I don\u2019t have privacy. But I think I would be breaking up with Sydney then because he would go crazy having <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">to [see] (ph?) me and I don\u2019t know if I had a place with Sydney, I\u2019m sure if that were a bigger place that that would stop the anxiety. I guess nothing will. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: What do you think would feel better about living with your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Being able to have healthy food without having to go through all these hoops to get it and having a kitchen that had enough space to cook it and having Hank around it, having enough space for Hank without worrying where I\u2019m going to put the litter box. They have three bathrooms so they can dedicate <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">one of the bathrooms to the cats.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: How was being at your parents\u2019 last week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: It was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Did you feel less panicked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: I did. There is still some [ ] (inaudible at 00:16:45) stuff that I can\u2019t stand my dad doing and I just grit my teeth through it, but other than that, that\u2019s just [ ]. I did feel less panicked there.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because it\u2019s being away, but I am just so scared. I\u2019ve gained all <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">this weight and I\u2019m diabetic now. I need to be healthy. (sobbing) I can\u2019t be healthy in this apartment with this tiny little kitchen that I don\u2019t have enough space to make healthy food. I guess also my parents said I could have salad. Sydney doesn\u2019t eat salad and it would just go bad if I just got some <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">to myself and only ate it on my own. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: Two thoughts to what I\u2019m hearing: There is a part of me that\u2019s listening to what you\u2019re saying and I can see how upset you feel. I know that the past couple of times that I talked to you, this has been pretty consistent. You\u2019ve been this upset for several weeks and so part of me is listening <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">to you and saying it really does seem like you need a lot more support because it seems like you feel really unable to take care of yourself in these ways and make these choices to do things to help yourself.  There is another piece of me that\u2019s hearing you talk yourself into it. You\u2019re talking in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">way that you\u2019re convincing yourself that you\u2019re not capable of doing those things; and I don\u2019t know how much of that is true and how much of that isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not possible for me to judge how capable you are or how much you\u2019re making your choices dependent on someone else. I hear you saying that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200733\">can\u2019t eat salad because Sydney doesn\u2019t eat it. Part of me wants to say, \u201cGeorgia, that\u2019s ridiculous. If you want to eat salad, you\u2019re a grown person. Make salad.\u201d There is another part of me that hears you feeling really not capable to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just getting to the grocery store on a regular basis is hard for me and it feels like such a big thing.  Doing it on the way home from work is a little bit less of a big deal because then I\u2019m already out. I don\u2019t have to make a trip like on my own, if I were to do it this afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: How hard is that? Because you were talking about this is a daily living skill, regular functioning, doing an errand. How hard is that for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess once I get out and do it, it\u2019s not as bad. It\u2019s just the getting out in the first place that\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the hard part about getting out? Are you feeling anxious about being out in public spaces?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling too tired to put on your coat? I need to understand what makes a daily living skill feel so insurmountable right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: I guess overcoming the inertia, it\u2019s the overcoming the feeling that this is going to be a big, horrible chore that\u2019s going to take forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: When you do it, does it still feel like a big, horrible chore or it\u2019s when you think about it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: It\u2019s when I think about it. Once I get in the car I think I\u2019m okay, but making salad would also be chopping up with cutting boards and all of that and having all those extra dishes to do and that also seems like . . . Although I was doing dishes last night from dinner and it really wasn\u2019t that bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: So hearing that, a lot of the things that you imagine are going to be so difficult for you, so taxing, when you actually do them they\u2019re not as bad as you\u2019re imagining. That makes me a little bit concerned about a path that leads you to doing less and less for yourself because it seems like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">you\u2019re kind of trapping yourself. If you move into an assisted living facility or a halfway house or something like that or move in with your parents and have less responsibility, then it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re reinforcing those ideas that you can\u2019t do these things, that you can\u2019t be an independent adult. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\"> Yet when you do them, when you do overcome that inertia, you\u2019re able to do them. You did the dishes last night. It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. It was possible in your kitchen. I think that when you do less and less you feel more and more trapped and you feel more and more dependent upon others; and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200873\">that actually makes you more anxious because when you think you can\u2019t do these things, when you feel helpless, it\u2019s a very threatening feeling. It\u2019s hard for me to sit here and know. I\u2019m not in a position where I can come to your house and see what it\u2019s really like for you, so I don\u2019t know how much <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200874\">of this is you thinking you can\u2019t and kind of talking yourself into a more helpless position and how much of it is really because of the way that you\u2019re suffering you can\u2019t.  That\u2019s sort of a determination that you have to honestly make for yourself, stepping outside the anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t step outside the anxiety so I can\u2019t really know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: This is your time to do it. You\u2019re in here in a safe place. You\u2019re not facing those challenges right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: I still have that [empty] (ph?) feeling right here. I feel it. It\u2019s there and I don\u2019t know why; in this room I shouldn\u2019t. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re in a really safe place right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s never enough. (pause) This anxiety makes me want to cry. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I should take some time off and just see what would happen if I lived at my parents\u2019 house for a week and if I was without Sydney, how that would feel.  It would make him sad, but I don\u2019t really know what else to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: I do think it\u2019s important to make decisions that are best for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: But ultimately if I end up breaking up with him because I took this break or something, that might not be good for me either. I don\u2019t want to break up with him, though it\u2019s not just choosing things that are good for me and not for Sydney. It\u2019s choosing things that might be bad for Sydney and, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">ultimately, that might hurt me. (crying) (pause)  I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so scared of everything. (crying) I don\u2019t know. Maybe it is just my brain being wrong. I can\u2019t tell. I do know that when I go to work I feel like \u2013 like I felt panic before getting there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: And then how were you the rest of the day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: I was fine once I got there. Eventually I got bored, but I wasn\u2019t panicking so maybe if I spent a minimum amount of time at my place I\u2019ll be okay. Most people go out of their house to work unless they\u2019re working from home or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Feeling like you\u2019re doing something productive is a really good, healthy feeling. Being at work is that time for you where you feel like you\u2019re accomplishing something; you\u2019re doing good. You\u2019re being appreciated for the skill that you bring to something. That\u2019s great feedback. I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">you to miss out on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not suggesting that I quit my job. If I did move in with my parents I would still be going to work and then I\u2019d have a half-hour commute instead of an hour-and-a-half commute. I\u2019m not quitting my job, though getting another one is really hard. I also found out that the two jobs, like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">one at Yale and the one at Stanford that I had applied to, I ended up having a typo in the resume.  [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:03) from not being able to spell. I applied for something last Monday at Yale and I found the typo before I sent it in for that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Oh, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: The person I talked to sent on the resume right away, but I never heard back from the person she sent it to. It turned out that last week she was interviewing people, so I\u2019m pretty sure that since I haven\u2019t heard anything from her, I\u2019m not even in the running, which I guess is sort of a relief <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">because it was a scary commute. I don\u2019t really have many prospects and I don\u2019t really know how to \u2013 just writing the cover letter, I just got some stuff today and wanted to write a cover letter for this position and had no idea. I really did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: But it was hard to do from your apartment? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I thought I was going to get stuff done. I left early so I could work on it here. That just didn\u2019t happen because I was too panicky and also because I was tired because I walked to Union and I\u2019m just so out of shape that I ended up having to drink a whole giant bottle of water after I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">got here. It was that much exertion, even though it was maybe a ten or 15-minute walk. I guess my backpack is also heavy since I brought the laptop since I thought I was going to be writing cover letters. Yeah, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: In terms of finding a more comfortable place to work, would it be possible after today\u2019s session to go to one of the cafes that has Wi-Fi and do some work from there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: Possibly. I\u2019m not sure.  If I can calm down enough, I can do that at least. Assuming Sydney left for his session, then I have an hour from when this session ends and when his ends. That would probably give me enough time to write the cover letter and send it all off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: It might be a good sense of completion. Have you talked to your parents about the idea of staying with them for a while? Do they know how upset you feel about your place now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: They do notice that I am because that\u2019s why they were willing to help me unpack. They said if the commute was . . . They said I could stay a couple of days a week if I wanted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: That might be a good compromise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It might be the only way to make it work. I don\u2019t know. I feel like such a failure for having to get to this point, like I should be able to do my own stuff. I should be able to live in an apartment that\u2019s not going to drive me insane.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I would like for you to be able to live in an apartment and not feel insane. There is no need to judge. You\u2019re not a failure. It\u2019s indicative of how much distress you\u2019re in. This is a real sign of anxiety and the depression that you\u2019ve suffered with. Like you said, the reaction is out of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">proportion to the trigger it seems, which isn\u2019t a mark of you being a failure. It is a mark of you being in a lot of distress. It speaks about the anxiety and the depression that you struggle with, not who you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">CLIENT: I feel like I should be able to do all these things without distressing this way and I know that it\u2019s out of proportion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">THERAPIST: If you were healthy you could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t know how to make myself mentally healthy again. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to get that start when everything seems so insurmountable. (sobbing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I agree. I hear you; and that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to look at both sides of it. I\u2019m trying to look at what are the things that you can do behaviorally to help yourself to start a positive feedback loop when you do things and they\u2019re not as bad as you think. That gives you more competence, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB1\">When you are able to provide something for yourself, that can build your confidence. That\u2019s why I push you to do things like go to the grocery store, to make yourself a meal, to get out for a walk, to get that workday in, because that gives you a good feeling to work off of. To balance that, pushing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB2\">yourself to do things so that you feel more competent with getting support from other places, like your parents, or we need to look at a higher level of care, like day treatment or something like that \u2013 to balance those two things where you\u2019re working to provide for yourself so that you can build up <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB3\">your own confidence, you can break this loop of increasing the symptoms, and also get additional support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">CLIENT: I think moving in with my parents I don\u2019t think I\u2019d need to be in a halfway house or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">THERAPIST: It sounds like your parents are open to having you stay a couple of days a week and that might be a really good compromise. It gives you a break from some of this, but also keeps you moving and doing the things that can get you headed back in the right direction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, so maybe my meds are also not effective anymore. Do you think if I\u2019m feeling this much anxiety for something that\u2019s such a disproportionately small trigger, could it be that my meds aren\u2019t working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Meds are always a part of the picture. I think definitely call your psychiatrist and let her know how intense things have been the past couple of weeks. You are certainly having more obsessive thoughts where it\u2019s hard for you to let go of these scary, catastrophic thoughts; and sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">meds can help break that cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019ve maybe gotten immune to them. I had switched over, so maybe if I go back on the Seroquel.  I wanted the other drug to work because of the whole weight thing, but I just can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re certainly in a lot of distress. I can\u2019t give you recommendations about what meds to use or not use; that\u2019s a consultation with your psychiatrist for sure. What I can tell you is what I\u2019m seeing in terms of your symptoms. You talking about the physical sense of anxiety, feeling that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C71\">heaviness in your chest, obviously you\u2019re really tearful and the things that I\u2019m hearing going on in your thoughts \u2013 having real perseverative thoughts, kind of rigid-thinking, the obsessiveness \u2013 those things snowball. Those things increase the feeling of anxiety that you\u2019re having and the more anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C72\">you get, the harder it is for you to think in ways that are helpful to you.  Medication can sometimes help alleviate some of that. Generally people don\u2019t become immune. Sometimes there is an intolerance that builds up with different types of medications and talking with your psychiatrist about the likelihood <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C73\">of it happening on the particular ones that you\u2019re on right now is a good question to ask.

So when you\u2019re at home, you need to play my role. When you\u2019re telling me about what\u2019s going on in your head, the things that you\u2019re thinking, a lot of times what I try to help you do is to question your <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D31\">own thoughts because what\u2019s making you feel anxious or increasing the anxiety is when you start to think worst-case scenario and jumping ahead, right? We often talk about jumping really far ahead. What if it\u2019s like this forever or the whole nine months of the lease? So your job to help yourself calm <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D32\">down is to start to question, \u201cIs what I\u2019m thinking absolutely true or is there maybe another possibility?\u201d  And it might be that what you come up with is, \u201cYes, what I\u2019m thinking could be true, but maybe there is also another way.\u201d Sometimes just bringing in that shadow of doubt which often exists <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D33\">can help you to calm down a little bit. Sometimes when we\u2019re talking on the phone or when we\u2019re talking in here that sometimes helps you to slow your breathing down and to broaden your thought a little bit. Sydney might be able to help you think that way. It sounds like one thing you respond to really <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D34\">negatively to is when he tells you to just calm down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: Which I\u2019ve told him before. I\u2019ve told him that I respond negatively and to say something else, but he, for some reason, can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Okay, so then he\u2019s not someone who can partner with you in helping you to think a little more broadly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">CLIENT: Maybe if I tell him specifically what to say, if it\u2019s an actual replacement with something that is helpful as opposed to \u201cjust don\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d maybe. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t necessarily need or want him to play the therapist\u2019s role, but handing him a phrase that might feel more empathic \u2013 something like \u201cWow, I can see that you\u2019re really anxious about this right now.\u201d Even that might serve to kind of provide a little bit of a holding space for you where <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB1\">he can be supportive. He might not be able to change your anxiety, but at least not exacerbate it with a \u201cjust calm down\u201d type of statement that just makes you feel even worse. Then you feel angry and anxious. So handing him that phrase, \u201cWhen I\u2019m really anxious, Sydney, can you say, \u2018Hon, I feel bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB2\">that you feel really anxious right now.\u2019\u201d  See if that helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll try. It might be something that he can\u2019t do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, he might not be able to. You might have to kind of play the other role for yourself and have, at least, those two voices going on in your head. \u201cWhat would Dr. Hallingford say and what would I say?\u201d Then you have both voices in your head. Not to become me, you just want to sort of play <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF1\">that conversation to help talk yourself into a place where you can see more options. When you have some options you feel better. When you feel trapped you feel really anxious. You have your soft, cuddly animal. Sometimes those textures can help take the edge off and be something soothing. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">CLIENT: (heavy breathing) I just feel like I\u2019ve lost all control of myself and I\u2019m being real silly for going this crazy over an apartment that is clearly a better living situation than what I had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s something to keep in mind, looking at what\u2019s better about it. So there are a lot of things that feel wrong about the apartment, but being able to do what you just did, in some ways it\u2019s better, looking at what\u2019s better about it. You mentioned that being in the living room feels better <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E31\">than being in the bedroom, so let\u2019s look at the framework of what\u2019s workable. It\u2019s safe. You don\u2019t have roommates that are disrespectful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E5\">CLIENT: There are no puppies or babies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E7\">THERAPIST: There are no puppies. There are no babies. You can watch what you want on TV.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t have the TV now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">THERAPIST: You were watching shows on your computer, so you have control over that. So looking at some of the things that you do have control over and that do feel safe about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">CLIENT: I can use the bathroom whenever I want. I\u2019m only sharing it with Sydney.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">THERAPIST: So this kind of a list is a helpful list to make. What else is good about it or, at least, neutral?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I can order take-out without having to worry about where I can eat it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">THERAPIST: So there is a space to eat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. No one is smoking in the apartment.  (pause) I can fit all my stuff there pretty much. I never did get the stuff from Aaron\u2019s place, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have enough room to fit those things. It fits everything that I brought to the other place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">THERAPIST: So with help you were able to find ways to unpack and arrange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sydney said he\u2019s willing to do more while I\u2019m at work this week. I\u2019m not going to arrange things until we can get Hank in here, possible. I don\u2019t know. That might not happen because . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t jump ahead. Stay with . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">CLIENT: I think having it more unpacked would probably be helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it would help a little bit more.  So this exercise is something you can do again at home. When you start to notice the things that are making you uncomfortable in the space, challenge yourself to look for some things that make you comfortable. When you start to feel frustrated by the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF1\">kitchen, challenge yourself to think about the things that are good about the kitchen, that you\u2019re not sharing that space with somebody else. You don\u2019t have to worry about whose food is whose \u2013 being able to look at some of the positives. If that is too much of a stretch, look at the things that are <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF2\">neutral. I think that will help you feel a little bit more control and a little bit more balance about it \u2013 what you just did now, if you can repeat that exercise for yourself multiple times a day. Would it be helpful to schedule an appointment before next week?  I have time on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561879\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20101\">CLIENT: When on Friday?
