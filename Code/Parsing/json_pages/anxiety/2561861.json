I was just doing something out there, just thinking about various things, today being the birthday it\u2019s the, kind of look at it New Year\u2019s almost, what have I done in the last few, what have I failed to do, what am I going to do in the coming year that as much as I, because it\u2019s funny, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">the expectation of having done significant things when you didn\u2019t set out to so they weren\u2019t the things that you set out to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I didn\u2019t set out to do a radio documentation (inaudible at 00:01:11), but it happened. Insignificant, sure, but I think the, I mean it\u2019s funny. I understand how it\u2019s hard to live up to things you don\u2019t lay out, but I also see that there\u2019s a value in the things that I didn\u2019t do. I didn\u2019t drink, and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">been four years now of sobriety. And though I think the, my fear is that I\u2019ve traded in one access, one delivery mechanism for addiction for another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you were addicted to alcohol? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: No, no, but I mean, delivery to the addiction to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: The thrill-seeking type\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, the attraction to women\u2019s attention. And not, so that\u2019s what I mean, it\u2019s like with not drinking, it\u2019s not much of a challenge because it\u2019s not-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: But not seeking that thrill of attention would be quite a challenge, and the alcohol is just a way to get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and now is it going to be a massage, for example, or you know, I\u2019m going to see you, for example, or people on the street, bus, whatever. So I know that, you know, the things that you and I have talked about not denying those things, but trying to find other ways to fulfill them or trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">to fill up time and space with things that don\u2019t make me feel bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And I understand that in theory, I do. But I think, I mean I know that I don\u2019t want to live that way, it\u2019s clear to me, but I think it\u2019s hard at times to consistently fill up my time with things that are helpful, things that are healthy, things that don\u2019t make me feel bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">When, like today is the day I feel good about who I am and my prospects. Yesterday wasn\u2019t a good day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: And what\u2019s the difference between yesterday and today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: So that just feels innate, like the way you felt yesterday and the way you feel today, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a thing that happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Well, yesterday I went out for errands fully intending on trying to get a massage someplace. Now granted, my lower back has been really hurting me lately, and so trying to get some relief with that has been legitimate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Whether I go to the gym on Wednesday and exercise and stretch a lot or trying to find some other type, Tylenol, I can\u2019t take ibuprofen, things like that. Yesterday I wanted to get some sort of treatment for it, so I went to one place, and this woman walked on my back, and it felt good. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">a half an hour. I didn\u2019t want to go for an hour because I didn\u2019t want it to be a flip-over, let\u2019s say. And I left there, I felt pretty good. There was another place a few blocks away, I went and tried this other place for a half hour. I go there, it wasn\u2019t a flip-over type thing. When I, when the woman <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">left the room, I masturbated. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">And that, to me, seemed better than the previous time when it was assisted, not assisted, chaperoned. So, you know, it\u2019s the allure of the thrill of the unknown that gets my heart racing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: So you said it felt better than the previous incident, but did it, what did it, what was it, can you be more, you felt better, but what did you actually feel? Were you okay with that, does that feel somewhat illicit but not quite as illicit as previous, what (inaudible at 00:06:53)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: No, I was okay with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You were okay with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I was by myself, and I was not being touched in other ways that were, that would have naturally led to that, even though it does, can get me excited. There wasn\u2019t any of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">And I don\u2019t know, I just, there\u2019s a switch that goes off after I\u2019ve ejaculated where it\u2019s like, okay, I\u2019m, I mean, those, that need for thrill and sex is now off. I can go about my day whatever I\u2019m trying to do, supposed to do (inaudible at 00:07:53), and so maybe it\u2019s because I\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Does that feel different than if you were to have sex with your wife, because obviously, there\u2019s a huge chemical component to having orgasm, where there\u2019s, you know, lots of endorphins and chemical reactions that there\u2019s definitely a switch that goes off. Does the switch feel different for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">you if it\u2019s, you know, having sex with your wife or something like this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I usually don\u2019t ejaculate when I have sex with my wife. She does, and then for me, it\u2019s just difficult because she\u2019s just really relaxed, and so then I end up usually masturbating then. So I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s something about having sex with my wife which is not, it\u2019s not entirely satisfying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">because I don\u2019t, I usually know what\u2019s going to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">It\u2019s not good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s not the unknown thrill. Has that been a longstanding pattern?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it used to be that she was having issues with her medication (inaudible at 00:09:39), whatever, it\u2019s, it would be hard for her to want to have sex, and when she did, she usually (inaudible at 00:09:47) she was waiting for me to be done and so now I feel like there\u2019s at least some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">understanding about what I\u2019m going through. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">That doesn\u2019t make it any easier for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: No, but it sounds like I mean, it\u2019s not really that you\u2019re having difficulty achieving erection or ejaculating, it\u2019s, there does seem to be something in the interaction because it\u2019s not sort of a medication issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, although my, yeah, so I have a hard time figuring out is it that I\u2019m not interested in sex with her, I think that might be it, which is, it\u2019s painful because I\u2019m not being entirely straight with her if I\u2019m, I mean, I can, you know, when I masturbate after having sex with her, it\u2019s next <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">to her, so she knows that I can do that. She knows why I can\u2019t, you know, ejaculating having sex, because it\u2019s you know, she\u2019s just too relaxed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">And if you get my meaning, but so I mean, the machinery works, but it\u2019s just like I\u2019m not necessarily drawn to that as being, \u201cOh, this is going to be great because who knows what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d I know what\u2019s going to happen, you know. I know what\u2019s going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And it doesn\u2019t feel all that enticing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Exactly. And I\u2019m sure all sorts of married couples have this issue, you\u2019ll hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: When was it different for you with her? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: At least three or four years, but I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: But given the length of time you\u2019ve been together, that means for lots of years it was very different, right? You\u2019ve been together a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: That history is just as important as the more recent history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, the problem, I think, is that when she was going through her own issues, it wasn\u2019t that it was all that satisfying for me, knowing that it just seemed like I was the one being satisfied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, it feels different to have a sexual partner that\u2019s really interested, engaged, versus having a sexual partner who\u2019s doing, willing to accommodate. It doesn\u2019t feel the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Physically, emotionally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, and being the one who seems to be the one who\u2019s just kind of accommodating right now is not satisfying, it\u2019s not thrilling, it\u2019s not, and you also feel like you\u2019re letting them down because you\u2019re not doing it maybe as often as they want, and b, when you are doing it, it seems like charity, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">perhaps. So I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s why these other escapades seem so exciting. But you know yesterday, I Googled, because the Internet is so useful for things like this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">Addiction to massage, and what it led to was so many discussions about people who go to massage places that are, you know, explicitly, we talked about this, (inaudible at 00:14:21), but this is like places that, where people go every day, or more than once in a day, and they\u2019re getting hand jobs at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">the end of every one, which is very different than what I was experiencing, so it\u2019s hard to understand where I fit into that spectrum of addiction. Nonetheless, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know what, I don\u2019t know what to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">Because I don\u2019t know how to suggest to my wife that, \u201cLet\u2019s try something different, because this is obviously boring,\u201d you know. How do you say that in so many words. Maybe she\u2019s bored too. But, you know, she\u2019s getting apparently what she wants out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Well do you know that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So I think it is perfectly appropriate to have a conversation with her, and say like, \u201cListen, it\u2019s not exactly what I want. What do you want? How do we make this something that is maybe more mutually satisfying for both of us?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Find out how happy she is with the status quo. It\u2019s okay for you not to be happy with the status quo. What feels worse for you is not being happy with the status quo and figuring out how to make yourself happy, just sort of by circumventing her in the process, because there\u2019s clearly a sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">of guilt around not being able to be straightforward with her, and maybe there are some things that you can be more straightforward with her about, without that causing really undue burden or stress or disappointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, and I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t mean to become too graphic or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: You can be open. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: You know, she knows there\u2019s a certain position that I like, but she does not want to do it because she feels it is degrading to women, that it\u2019s uncomfortable, and that those two things should be enough for me to not want to do it. I understand that. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t want to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s (inaudible at 00:17:38) you know illegal, I mean, it\u2019s just, you know, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not comfortable for her, on two levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I don\u2019t, you know, I don\u2019t pursue it, obviously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">So\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And so then the conversation becomes about, I mean, are there other things that aren\u2019t sort of beyond her boundaries that would be more satisfying than what\u2019s happening now? Right? So there are certain things that she said are, you know, everyone has their limits in what feels comfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">and what doesn\u2019t feel comfortable, and you want to be respectful, obviously, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s maybe not room for something else than what\u2019s happening now that might meet those needs more closely or at least be different because you\u2019re experimenting with something new or something that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">not part of the sort of, you know, typical fare right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">And I wonder if she would be open to sort of having those kinds of conversations with you and maybe exploring a little bit like what\u2019s something different that we haven\u2019t done that might be okay?

Or sought out a new experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well we went out to Provincetown last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Okay. How was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: It was good, except for all the other tourists, you had to walk three, four aside down the narrow sidewalks which was infuriating, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: But were you infuriated together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a bonding moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Did you enjoy being with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yes, I did. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">Yeah, I mean, there are those things. I understand they, how they can be appealing, but those things, for both (inaudible at 00:22:21) just myself, are hard to compete with the heart rates and thrills that I get when I\u2019m in here or when I\u2019m on my stomach, you know. And I\u2019m just not sure what the best <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">way forward is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Do you ever have the heart-racing feelings with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: No. And I don\u2019t know that I would expect to at this point in the relationship. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s not worth having or anything like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s not new. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It isn\u2019t, and it can\u2019t be expected to hold the same appeal as it did seventeen years ago or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: But you, but I think you can expect to feel fulfilled, so maybe the question to explore is whether or not, can you feel fulfilled without that in a relationship or do you need to find a way to experience that alongside her if not triggered by her, right? So sort of that, the newness and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">sort of titillation of not knowing is something that comes with new experiences, and she\u2019s not new to you, but you guys could seek out new things together so that you can experience that feeling with her, if you need that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">Maybe you don\u2019t need, necessarily need to have that in your relationship with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Doesn\u2019t every couple need that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. I think you need, you need to feel satisfied. What you need to feel satisfied might not be the same in every, for everybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I understand that and, you know, I do imagine that as being part of my present, in the present, or in the future, and long-term future, and that is part of how I imagine things moving forward. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">But, and I guess, I just wonder to what extent the thrill provides. I mean obviously, the thrill is, does not offset the damage, the feeling of badness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Not the way you\u2019re getting fulfilled now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Exactly, and I have to think where I\u2019m going with this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">I guess I just don\u2019t know if, how the desire for these particular needs or desire for these feelings is related to my own feeling of deficiency, you know, or my history, all those things, baggage. I mean, I know that the desire to feel these things is a well-worn groove. Alcohol is for someone else, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">this is for me, and you know, the shot in the bar for someone else might be, you know, a lingering glance from some stranger on a bus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">And I get that that\u2019s not in and of itself, a bad thing, but I\u2019m not sure I understand how to categorize it or balance it with the other parts of my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Because of what tends to give you that sensation of excitement, because it tends to be something, you know, an interaction with a woman, and sexualized, it feels like it interferes in a way that, you know, some other behavior might not, because it\u2019s relationship-based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And would I want my wife to know this was happening? Certainly not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">And I think that\u2019s probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s the biggest piece that gets in the way for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, if I were single, I think there\u2019d be a different thing altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you wouldn\u2019t feel guilty, but you feel like a betrayal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Having your needs met when you feel like it\u2019s somehow a betrayal to someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And the way it stands now, it does. It feels like it\u2019s in competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, this might seem like a really basic question, but what, I mean, I understand I can\u2019t just shut that off and say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to look at other people.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">And I know on a day like today when I\u2019m feeling good more or less, I can look at somebody and say, \u201cThey\u2019re an attractive person.\u201d That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: And not say anything back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">c \/ Yeah. And that\u2019s when certain needs are being met. I\u2019m feeling good about myself. But I went to the gym for an hour on Wednesday, and I woke up yesterday and played guitar for half an hour, so some of those things were being met, and yet there I went. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">And granted, you know, my, I feel like my motives were driven by my lower back which is poorly regarded right now, but would I have told Julie that I was going to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You wouldn\u2019t have told her that you were going to get a massage or you wouldn\u2019t have told her that you masturbated after?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Either. Certainly not the latter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Why not the first? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Well, when we were living in Harvard, last time we were here, it was right then that this massage place that was being shut down because of illicit activities and sex, basically. And so she remembers that, and when I told her that I was going to this place that was down the street, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">and try it out, she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, what kind of place is it?\u201d So I know she\u2019s suspicious of places, and I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Suspicious of places or suspicious of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Of places, I think, and I don\u2019t know if I can say, \u201cWell whenever I get a lower back problem then I get a massage.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: If you were going to the PT and getting a massage, would that be different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: I think so, and I think it would also be different if\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Would that hold an allure for you? Like would you, if it could be replaced or is there something\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: It would take the thrill out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: It might, it might not. I mean, I think it depends on who\u2019s doing it. If you were doing it, it probably would make it thrilling. If it were some colleague next door, it probably wouldn\u2019t. Nothing against him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">But, you know, that\u2019s, I think, the attention, the touch. Those things are, and you know, I\u2019ve actually even thought about that, that need, and if it could be met at home, and I\u2019m not convinced that it could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: What makes you doubt that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: Well my wife doesn\u2019t like massage at all, and when I talk about massage with her, the fact that she doesn\u2019t like it suggests that she probably doesn\u2019t know how to, how it might be enjoyed. But who knows? I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: So I think, you know, those days when I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to go down to the place that I trust and get a massage because my lower back\u2019s\u2014\u201d. \u201cOkay.\u201d When I do that, when I tell her where I\u2019m going and she knows what I\u2019m doing, I can enjoy myself, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sneaking around. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">I don\u2019t feel like I have to, you know, prepare a story about where I\u2019m going, what I\u2019ve been doing, but I think it\u2019s not just a matter of telling her that I\u2019m going to the place down the street versus not telling her that I\u2019m going to one of those places on Yelp, I\u2019m just not entirely convinced that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">my selection process is entirely true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because it does, it sounds like there\u2019s a little bit of questioning sort of what if, what might happen? And so part of yourself wants to leave that wiggle room, and it\u2019s, and you\u2019re not always going to the place you trust down the street, or you know exactly what you\u2019re getting. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">almost that part of you wants, there are times when there\u2019s a piece of you that wants to seek out what might happen if there was a little gray area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Absolutely. Very well said. And that\u2019s, to me, what\u2019s I think, bothers me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because you\u2019re not sure you want your intentions to be pure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Especially when I know how I\u2019m feeling that day, and what I\u2019m seeking out. I\u2019m seeking out\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Right, and you don\u2019t think you can get that from her, right, so if you\u2019re having a day where you felt a little down about yourself, it\u2019s something, you\u2019re not sure you really, that she ever could give you that thrill and help feel, help you to feel like you\u2019re kind of being built back up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">Or if you want her for that role, even if she could?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I hadn\u2019t thought it would matter, but right now it\u2019s the (inaudible at 00:38:36) think it\u2019s the profession.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:38:57)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:39.00).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: How come? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Here or there, and it\u2019s a well-worn path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: And I wonder why you chose it right then? Right after you sort of, well right after I posed those two choices of whether it could be fulfilled by her or whether you want it to be? That\u2019s when you went away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s, I don\u2019t, not being an expert in marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Nobody is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t know how people, you know, you hear all the time about accessories and toys and things that make those things more exciting as a means of, you know, supplanting the boredom or whatever, so yeah. I get it that this is not something unique in a marriage, but, and this is also <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201191\">not necessarily just my responsibility. I understand that too. You know, she\u2019s getting her needs satisfied as far as I can tell, when it happens, but how far is she willing to go to let my needs be satisfied? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">Does she even know what my needs are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: How true. These are really good questions and conversations to have. How else would you know? How open are you guys to talking about that stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Not very. I think it\u2019s, you know, I think in the past when she\u2019s wanted to address it with me, I felt that okay, she\u2019s not happy with it, I\u2019m doing something wrong, I feel bad. Can (inaudible at 00:41:36) for just a second?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: It looks like not really, you\u2019re fine, actually fine, sorry, just you had like a depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: Oh, I thought you were (inaudible at 00:41:59) my hair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: On the other side, but anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">You\u2019re fine. And so I felt yeah, that this is a problem, I get sensitive, I get defensive. You know, but that was a long time ago, and that was when I was reaching climax and she was not and this was also the time when she was on the pills and so on and so forth. You know, not enough foreplay and things <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201291\">like that. And these days, there\u2019s hardly any foreplay and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m the one who\u2019s cutting it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: And so I mean, it would be ridiculous for either of us, but especially her, to admit that there\u2019s, or to deny that there\u2019s not a problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: I think first you need to decide whether or not you really want to address it in the relationship. It does seem like there\u2019s a problem. There\u2019s clearly a problem. You\u2019re not feeling satisfied and you\u2019re seeking some sort of sexual satisfaction out of the relationship, which was not part of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F1\">your agreement with her. So that\u2019s an issue. Deciding if you want to address the issue in the relationship means you have to actually talk about it with her. It doesn\u2019t mean you need to be ready to have full disclosure about everything that you\u2019re missing and everything that has been, you know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F2\">you\u2019ve been seeking out, but nothing\u2019s going to change in the relationship unless you guys start talking about it and getting past that barrier of being able to say, well, like, \u201cI\u2019m not totally happy. Can we start talking about ways to explore other stuff so that we can both be happy in each other?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F3\">That\u2019s, nothing in a relationship changes unless you actually talk about them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2012E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">And it sounds like some of the stuff might be independent of her and just, you know, stuff that you\u2019re working out and is related to earlier experiences in your life, but that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not all of it. You know, it\u2019s not all happening in a vacuum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s a conversation I\u2019m not exactly ready to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: I can understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not going to tell her about how I\u2019m meeting those other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: But that doesn\u2019t preclude you from her, from telling her that you\u2019d be maybe interested in trying something new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: You\u2019re absolutely right. I think that\u2019s where, presenting that in and of itself should be enough as a start of a conversation. But you know, as I said at the beginning, this thing, this new year, and lately I\u2019ve been thinking just about the amount of power, influence, control I have over my <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B1\">life, and it appears I have some influence to live the way I want to live. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">And as I was leaving that first place yesterday, the first massage place, and I was putting on my shoes and I said to myself, in a very loud voice, \u201cWhy do you want to go someplace where it could possibly make you feel really bad? Why do you want to do that? Why don\u2019t you just go home? Why don\u2019t you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D1\">just, you\u2019re feeling better, why don\u2019t you just go back? You\u2019re feeling better, why don\u2019t you just go home?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">And I\u2019ve heard that same voice say something after I\u2019ve had three pieces of pizza, \u201cYou really don\u2019t need this. Why don\u2019t you just put it away? Why don\u2019t you just not eat this? Why don\u2019t you just, you know (inaudible at 00:46:48),\u201d and I ignore that voice eight times out of ten. And this is not new <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">to me, of course I know that. But you know, it begs the question, do I have control? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">Am I willing to take control? And you know, why do I not listen to that voice? Nine times out of ten, but not ten, it\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">THERAPIST: It also sounds really judgmental. One of the first things they teach us when we work with the clients is try to not ask questions that start with \u201cwhy,\u201d because why sets off defensiveness, and all of the questions you asked yourself started with, \u201cWhy are you going to go someplace else where <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201431\">it might make you feel bad? Why are you going to have that third piece of pizza when you don\u2019t really need it?\u201d And the response we feel defensive is, \u201cBecause I want to so fuck you.\u201d So to retraining, of course you have some control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">CLIENT: This is (inaudible at 00:48:04), happy birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s nice. You have a lot of siblings, you must get a lot of those a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Retraining yourself to prompt yourself to make choices in the direction that you want, so that instead of saying, \u201cWhy are you going to go someplace where you might end up feeling badly after?\u201d asking \u201cI wonder how I could, I wonder what I could do next that I would feel good about?\u201d You <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">might end up making the same choice, you might end up making a different choice, but being able to talk to yourself in a way that elicits less defensiveness and prompts you to actually make choices for the longer-term, right? I mean, because what you\u2019re really struggling against is impulsivity, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B2\">It\u2019s the classic, you know, you put the marshmallow in front of the kid and you see how, who can resist the marshmallow the longest. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561861\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">Being able to prompt yourself in that situation to be able to say, \u201cThat might taste really good right now, but it would feel better later.\u201d And the way they do that test is they say to the kids, you put a marshmallow in front of the kid, say, \u201cYou can have this now, or if you wait until I come back, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D1\">you can have two.\u201d Some kids grab it right away, little impulse control, no ability to delay the gratification for later for a better reward. You know in your adult brain that the better reward is actually feeling good about yourself. When you feel good about yourself it lasts longer, but it sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D2\">takes longer to get there, you have to delay the earlier gratification in order to get the longer-standing one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">But setting up the situation so that you\u2019re more likely to make that choice is a lot about how you talk to yourself, and critiquing, judging, speaking to yourself harshly, telling yourself you\u2019re bad, none of that actually sets us up to be able to delay instant gratification. You want something good <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">to offset all that negativity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. Well, and I think the question is, the voices, \u201cYou don\u2019t need that piece of pizza.\u201d And my response is\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Well I want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Well that, and, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t change. Who do you think you are? This is beyond my control.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: Well whose voice is that? Who was that before it was you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Well, the voice that says, I don\u2019t know, I mean, I think it\u2019s me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: My guess is it\u2019s somebody before you. You learn how to talk to yourself from someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: Well (inaudible at 00:50:53) by next time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well you can think about everything. Feel free to think about it before you come back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity, I\u2019m sure. Well thank you for meeting me earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: Oh, you\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t move it more, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: Back to back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: I was unsure how easy it would be to find a parking spot, and it was easier than I imagined, so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, if I had another opening, I would have slipped you into it, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
