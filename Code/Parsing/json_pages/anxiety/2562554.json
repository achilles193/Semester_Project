This... he\u2019s like oh, well you have to see this vet because he does all the travel... he knows... they asked me what country I\u2019m going to and this and that. So we\u2019ll see what he says. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] specialization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. Meanwhile, so you know I published that post, like I said, that article. Got tons and tons of... it\u2019s been very sweet, really. People are like it\u2019s so amazing to be able to read something that articulates things that I think or struggle with, but... all this stuff. Then this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">one fucking... this girl Eva, who I\u2019ve just had this weird annoying... ever since... this is why I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a life coach; this is the reason. Ever since this broad became a life coach, these are the exchanges, okay. You\u2019re getting a lot of inputs about your post on Facebook At the risk of being...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: This is Eva who you rented a space from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: No. No, no, no. That...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] life coach. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, no, no, that Eva is really cool. This is a girl I dated briefly a long time ago and then, whatever, she became a life... she went to Phoenix, it\u2019s a big life... she got all these certificates. And ever since then you cannot have a normal exchange with this woman because everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">is like well, Claire, [ph] I don\u2019t know. I mean are you really happy. You know what I mean? Everything is... so at the risk of being one among many, a place that has always been unappealing to me, while at the same time being a place of comfort I don\u2019t know what any of that means let me share with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200452\">you. Your writing is amazing, your choices courageous. My wish is that you\u2019ll find all that you need and hope for in your move. Fine. As you know this is the part that I had to give her a little bit of a backhand as you know, wherever you go, there you are.  I hope it\u2019s easier to be and love who <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200453\">you are where you\u2019re headed. Most amazing wishes to you. I was like well... so I just said well, that\u2019s the... one of the points I made in the essay, that wherever you go, there you are, right, I get that. And I was like it has nothing to do with me loving or knowing myself at all. But I was like... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200454\">but regardless, thanks for the note. It\u2019s... this is the kind of people... I know there are a lot of people in Assyria who are dipshits, but they\u2019re not this, yet. They\u2019re not there yet. They\u2019re getting there, but they\u2019re not that yet, this kind of sappy like that\u2019s about you, it\u2019s not about me. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200455\">know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Fucking unbelievable. I really almost want to tell her you know what? Ever since I decided to be a life coach and got back in touch with you, each one of our exchanges has fortified my doubts about becoming a life coach.  This is why. It\u2019s like all my therapist friends, all my... they... I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">know what it is. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re not. I mean, I don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re this way but I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re like in a bar or whatever. But it\u2019s really fucking annoying. It\u2019s really fucking annoying. Anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s... it feels inauthentic. It\u2019s sort of never actually just being... having a real conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Why can\u2019t you just leave it at courageous; your writing is amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, like why...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Best of luck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Exactly. As you know, it says... if she\u2019s... it\u2019s a little... don\u2019t get ahead of yourself. I\u2019ve got five certificates in life coaching so I know better than you do. It\u2019s like go fuck yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. Anyway. So yeah. So overall I feel pretty good. I mean I\u2019m really stressed about getting there with no money still, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.  At this point, as long as I can just literally get there with even just enough to just get there. You know what I mean? If they <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">charge me more at the airport or if they... those are the kinds of things they... and then figure it out I guess. Last night I met up with this chick Selena [ph]. Have I told you about this girl? Off and on I\u2019ve been seeing this girl. She\u2019s got... she used to be a fashion designer in San Diego, whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">all this stuff. This whole time I thought... I mean I know that she\u2019s very attracted to me, whatever, whatever, we\u2019ve hung out. But there\u2019s something also very reserved about her. In some ways she\u2019s actually very Samantha-esque.  She\u2019s very... she can trace her family back like daughters of the revolution <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200593\">and fucking England and very kind of like that whole thing. Last night I meet her for a drink and she starts crying. She\u2019s like I\u2019m really going to miss you and... so what the fuck is happening. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t know she liked me but I just... say what? It was almost kind of annoying a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200594\">bit. But yeah, it\u2019s like sometimes you think you know kind of what someone\u2019s... where someone\u2019s coming from.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Like it\u2019s almost too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Well she went from being a pretty... she was very... she\u2019s got that kind of blue blood kind of whatever thing about her so she\u2019s not really emotive per se.

Right. I\u2019m kind of scared to hang out with her again now. I don\u2019t want to... it\u2019s... I kind of can\u2019t deal with it. You know what I mean? So I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s... you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it also sets off for you something about your relations to your mother. Is there kind of... was either your stoic father or your mother\u2019s obtrusiveness and too much of her. Too much...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true, yeah. In the past, though, that does... that... yeah, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t handle women getting emotional very well. Yeah, you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s a turnoff almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It can be. Yeah. It\u2019s true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Well especially if also it\u2019s [inaudible] is her being somewhat aloof and accessible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: But I also don\u2019t like extremes. Like you can\u2019t be one and then... just be it. Be more emotive and blah, blah, blah, and then I can generally kind of adjust. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s the unpredictability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s only thing I don\u2019t... yeah, that... because then I start worrying that holy shit this is like a Michelle type situation, like one minute like this, one minute like that, this week all kind of cold, next week can\u2019t live without you. It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s also your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s true kind of, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Loving and warm one minute [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, you\u2019re right.

I don\u2019t like big goodbyes and this and that, which, I don\u2019t know, for me, I think that\u2019s healthy for me. You know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">I don\u2019t like that kind of melodrama. Yes, it is a big deal and I get it. It\u2019s a big fucking deal, but just... it doesn\u2019t do anything for me to sit there in a bar and let it kind of overtake me. Do you know what I mean? I think all of these things have their healthy parts. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200812\">if I go to an Assyrian monastery and I feel like having a cry, of course I\u2019ll have a cry. But then am I going to talk about that monastery at the bar and get super emotional and break down at the bar?  I hope not. That... to me that\u2019s... you know what I mean? That\u2019s maybe not so\u2026 there are people there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200813\">and they\u2019re having drinks and they might want to have a very serious discussion about it, very heartfelt, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want me to start a countdown?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, don\u2019t... when I come in every day like a... yeah.

It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that\u2019s one of the things that made me... I\u2019m... I would see differently than the way you\u2019re constructing it.  It\u2019s as though the more tears the more permanent it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t mean it that way. I just mean maybe I don\u2019t feel that emotional about it, honestly. I think I don\u2019t, kind of. I just feel like yes, I\u2019m... for example [inaudible] my Assyrian friends, who I love so much, even my mom, my grandmother, actually more than my mom, right. I mean someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">who really is... God knows how many months or whatever she has left. I somehow feel... I don\u2019t not feel sad or anything like that, or not emotional, I just... I don\u2019t know how to explain. I mean I feel like I\u2019ve somehow reconciled everything. You know what I mean? I\u2019m just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Well maybe another way of putting it is it\u2019s sort of like... I think about the transition of people going off to college for the first time.  Often, if they\u2019re... especially if they\u2019re moving out of the home. It\u2019s certainly sad, you\u2019re going to miss your family, but it\u2019s not really globally <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">a sad event. It\u2019s a really exciting forward event. If it\u2019s... you\u2019re ready for it and it\u2019s... that\u2019s the next step in development, it\u2019s a really good thing that is happening. So sadness isn\u2019t sort of what\u2019s running the show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Right, right. Or not that level of sadness, where there\u2019s crying and this and that. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m really going to miss you but man...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s a new adventure. And who the fuck knows, maybe I\u2019ll be back in the summer to visit, you know what I mean? Who knows what... I mean it\u2019s not... it\u2019s really not that big of a... it is a big deal to me but overall, in terms of when I\u2019m going to see my friends again or whatever, I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">come on, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Yeah.  And I think sometimes it is important to be a little self-protective. Do you know what I mean? I just need to get there. I don\u2019t want to... I feel pretty good. I\u2019m trying to take things a day at a time. So I don\u2019t want to really wallow in that. Or not wallow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200992\">I don\u2019t want to open that door of just wow, I really might not see my grandmother. Maybe I\u2019ll deal with that when I get there. You know what I mean? But I don\u2019t... that\u2019s not going to help me right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: What are you worried about, that if you actually let in the feelings about potentially not seeing your grandmother or the feelings about this changing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Well no, I mean personally I can let it in, but I can\u2019t sit with someone and have a cry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: How come?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: That doesn\u2019t feel helpful to me.  Well honestly because I don\u2019t feel like I... I don\u2019t feel compelled. I don\u2019t feel teary. You know what I mean? But also because it\u2019s just not helpful, because it does make it seem more kind of melancholy than it really is. It\u2019s just not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] it doesn\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Just because you are full of feeling and a day with your grandmother or a session here, that makes it more like depressing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: I guess. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m just so sick of the melodrama in the family that I just... I so love my friends. They\u2019re so... like one of them goes to Cairo for three months, one of them goes\u2026 it\u2019s just like hug and awesome. When you get back let me know if you need a ride from the airport. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">Just... that\u2019s... something about that just seems so much healthier to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Well especially when the alternative is melodrama.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s what... it\u2019s sort of like anything emotional. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well because I just feel like you don\u2019t need... we don\u2019t need to spell things. I get it. You know what I mean? Of course I\u2019m going to terribly miss here and my friends, but it\u2019s like those are givens. I don\u2019t need to put it on display. Do you know what I mean? Unless I genuinely feel like crying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">then I will. You can\u2019t control that anyway, right, if you\u2019re going to get choked up you will. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t need to do it as a performance or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I mean. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. I\u2019m not feeling that level of... I\u2019ve even tried. I\u2019ll be like wow, I\u2019m leaving this apartment. It just feels more like wow, holy shit, I\u2019m leaving this apartment. And one day I\u2019ll come back and this apartment will be here and I\u2019ll kick out <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">the tenant and I\u2019ll move right back up here. I mean what... yeah, I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Exactly. Or I\u2019ll come back and I\u2019ll get a nice fucking apartment somewhere where I don\u2019t have to be right next to my family and or whatever. You know what I mean? Maybe I\u2019ll move to Maine. Maybe I\u2019ll move to fucking San Diego or Halifax. Who the fuck knows. But yeah, I\u2019m not... I\u2019m just not... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">it\u2019s just not the same. When I went to London I did get teary eyed by the way. And when I saw my friends the last night, whatever, I felt... suddenly I felt overcome. But this time I\u2019m not... just not feeling it. Maybe I will a little bit but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: No, I do too. So I don\u2019t know.  Maybe it\u2019s also that... some of my Assyrian friends will come to Assyria. You know what I mean? It\u2019s different. London really was like who the fuck\u2019s going to... I mean someone really has to go out of their way to visit you there. Assyria\u2019s just... my mom wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">to come now. All my friends are like holy shit, now we have... now Brian\u2019s going to be there. I\u2019ve got to go to Assyria. So that... even that feels a little different. And knowing people once I get there feels very different. I don\u2019t know. I just... I\u2019m not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s more continuous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, something... yeah, something just feels like I\u2019m... I mean I know I\u2019m kind of like... it\u2019s not the same but I\u2019m like honestly it\u2019s a ten hour drive.  I mean I can drive those ten hours back. It\u2019s not... it is a big deal and it\u2019s not. So I mean it\u2019s the same as what I wrote about the country, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">right. Yeah, it\u2019s Assyria, but it\u2019s also just a place. I mean I... those two things can inhabit you equally. You can be overcome by whatever and then be really fucking annoyed at the bad service at the caf\u00e9 or whatever it is. I think this time I\u2019m not even going to do a last get together kind of.  You <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C92\">know what I mean? I think I\u2019m just going to organically let it... I want to see people but not under the banner of this is the last time we\u2019re going to have drinks and then I\u2019m getting on a plane and... I don\u2019t want... it\u2019s a bit much. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want to [inaudible] like have a last band practice for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Because it\u2019s not a bridge that somehow is being burned down or... we\u2019ll be in touch, we\u2019ll swap files, we\u2019ll whatever. It\u2019s not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And maybe it feels that way here, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Oh, totally. Well I mean here it feels that way the most because this is the most continuous, long term, right. So I mean to me it\u2019s just like you pick it up where you left off.  It\u2019s not The one thing I do think, though, is it\u2019s almost the opposite. I\u2019m starting to think... I just thought of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">this. I\u2019m starting to think, for example, her kind of getting all teary eyed last night, maybe it\u2019s also because not only do I not feel quite that way, I\u2019m, how to put it, I\u2019m excited to go. So in a way... but I don\u2019t... but because of how I am these days, I don\u2019t want to be all over... I was very careful <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D12\">about being too excited. So someone\u2019s tears or whatever only highlight that.  I don\u2019t want either kind of... I like this place of... I feel very even keeled. You know what I mean? And it\u2019s very touching for people to be sad and I\u2019m sad too, whatever. But I don\u2019t want to be like woo hoo, I\u2019m getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D13\">the fuck out. I\u2019m not like that. And I\u2019m also not like oh my God, I\u2019m leaving. It feels very good to be like I\u2019m one of millions of people who are going to travel on that particular day and... you know what I mean? I feel like in the past things become so imbued with meaning. And I haven\u2019t been doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D14\">that lately, and that feels so good. Band practice, it\u2019s just a bunch of guys getting together at a practice space who nobody knows, nobody cares about. So if I don\u2019t feel like doing it, I\u2019m just not going to do it. Like I... you know what I mean? It\u2019s not some big dilemma.  And the same with this trip. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D15\">It\u2019s like I\u2019m one of a lot of people that are going to pack up and go through checkout, get on a plane, go somewhere. Yes, it has a lot of personal things but it kind of feels good to just strip it down to just I\u2019m going to go there and if I don\u2019t like it I\u2019m going to get a ticket and come back. Or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D16\">I\u2019m going to like it, it\u2019s going to be great, I\u2019m going to write you all e-mails and fucking Skype away. I mean it\u2019s going to be so much different now, too, right? Like back then I didn\u2019t even have an iPhone, I couldn\u2019t... it really did feel more disconnected to me. Now it\u2019s like this is free, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D17\">free, Viber, iPhone, Skype. I mean it just doesn\u2019t have that same weight to me for whatever reason. So it just feels like a fun, kind of hopeful moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a way, though, that you\u2019re talking about it, Brian, is I get how much it feels like this is healthier than getting pulled into the extremes, and I think... I agree with you.  But there\u2019s something that sounds like you\u2019re afraid that could happen. So almost like no tears so that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">doesn\u2019t... I don\u2019t risk getting pulled into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: Right, even though I know I won\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Right, that\u2019s different than just knowing you won\u2019t.

I\u2019ve been saying, right, for a while that\u2019s just going to be how it is right now. I\u2019m just hyper-vigilant. I know that I won\u2019t... I keep... obviously there\u2019s evidence every single day that things aren\u2019t triggering this or that, but right now I just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">it kind of feels good to be like I\u2019m just going to be hyper-vigilant about this one fucking thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Are you afraid you wouldn\u2019t go, for example, if you walk out that fantasy. I don\u2019t mean literally but what\u2019s the fear of if you actually got sucked into the tears, what would happen? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Well there...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: What would that look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Well there isn\u2019t a fear because I can\u2019t imagine getting sucked into that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And I know you can\u2019t, in reality, now about who you are, but what... the fear at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t know, that I just don\u2019t want to be... I\u2019m going to... yeah, would I not want to leave? I don\u2019t know. Yeah, it might make me doubt the logistics. Not the going. Like shit I can stay two more months maybe and just get there right when I\u2019m about to start working or something like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">Or yeah, that I don\u2019t want to start feeling depressed and more nervous and anxious about leaving my mom here and not seeing my grandmother. I don\u2019t want to go there because I\u2019ve been dealing with that my whole life. So I just feel very self-protective.  I don\u2019t want to think about those things right <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E92\">now. And I feel like I have a right to not think about them. Whether I... whether they\u2019re going to trigger something or not. You know what I mean? I\u2019m just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And I think as a... I persist in bringing it up, though, still because I think you were even more truly protected from it not going there. To the degree that we can talk about that in advance, that those are the fears. In other words, even what you just articulated was... that\u2019s a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">bit news to me, just thinking... it\u2019s not that it\u2019s hard to imagine, but the kinds of things... what I would worry about is the things you\u2019re guarding against right now is what happens three weeks into being Assyria. Do those start to come in, like oh shit, I left my mother, I\u2019ll never see my grandmother again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: But see, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That\u2019s why I said I\u2019ll deal with that when I\u2019m there. Of course that\u2019s going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: But I think if you deal with it now you\u2019re so much better off going there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Right, but see... but that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. I have nothing to give about it right now because I don\u2019t really feel sad.  I don\u2019t... even if I stop and really think, like I said, my mom, my grandmother, somehow I can\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not feeling it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m not feeling it. So when I get there I have no doubt that I might... if I get there and I find out God forbid about my grandmother or whatever, that\u2019s really going to suck. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m going into it knowing that fully. I fully get that. And I\u2019ve kind of made peace with it. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F51\">I\u2019m like well my grandmother kind of doesn\u2019t know me now anyway. She knows me in the moment. And the minute I leave it\u2019s as if I wasn\u2019t there. And so I\u2019ve just made peace with that. And with my mom it\u2019s a little bit of a lesser degree of the same thing.

So she\u2019s healthy, all is well, so I don\u2019t see why that shouldn\u2019t continue.

In other words, I [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">CLIENT: Right. Well, and I kept trying, yeah. I kept trying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">THERAPIST: I start to wonder, Brian, if there\u2019s something that\u2019s kept you bound to her unconsciously because of losing your father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">THERAPIST: Having to be around to protect her or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, well I mean there is something, again it doesn\u2019t make me emotional right now, but yeah, of course, if I lose my mom that\u2019s fucked up. It\u2019s me. I mean there is no immediate nuclear family. That\u2019s weird. That\u2019s really weird. But I\u2019m at a place now where I\u2019m like... well, but see, again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201091\">I\u2019m making it kind of about me and my... yeah, of course it\u2019s fucking terrible.  That is terrible and I will feel it and I\u2019ll be sobbing and... but I look around me and lots of people that get into their 40s don\u2019t have their parents. I mean that\u2019s just... it just happens. So that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">THERAPIST: And would not consider not moving to then be stuck in their development in order to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: Right, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. So it just feels good right now to be like no, I\u2019m not going to... I know it won\u2019t suck me into anything but right now it just feels good to go. I like just whatever this is. When I get to Assyria, I mean I think the way I\u2019m thinking about it is it\u2019s already <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D1\">going to be emotional, right, so if... I mean I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s going to happen, but if I get there and I\u2019m like oh, my mom, my grandmother, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll go to a monastery and cry about... I\u2019ll just... I\u2019ll get that... all that shit out of the way. Because in a way it\u2019s all connected. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D2\">not London, it\u2019s Assyria, right. So it\u2019s their stories, their whole fucking lives, the shit they\u2019ve been through, they\u2019re all encapsulated in these God damn ruins. So... or it\u2019s because I\u2019m ready.  Just writing that one essay, I think, even... like I just said what had to be said and that\u2019s... it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D3\">not rattling around inside me. It\u2019s being processed. So I feel melancholy a little, I mean, even though I actually don\u2019t but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t seem melancholy to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s different than feeling sad for a second or I\u2019m going to miss somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I was going to say. At moments I feel sad and whatever but yeah I just... just not... it just changes when you\u2019re able to really step outside yourself, really do it, not just kind of say you\u2019re doing it. And then live by that. You know what I mean? Because today I\u2019m like wait a minute, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201151\">I have all these friends who... they do all kinds of shit. My friends, the Leo\u2019s Place guys, they just lost their mom, okay. Now both their parents are dead. Their oldest brother\u2019s the filmmaker. That\u2019s guy\u2019s been away forever.  Forever. So he never really... and they\u2019re all... they\u2019re a family. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201152\">not like he was oh, go fuck yourselves. But the guy just had to do what he had to do. And so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s sadness, there\u2019s this, there\u2019s that, but I mean... and I haven\u2019t been able to do that because...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s so much excitement if that\u2019s... if this is part of becoming who you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">THERAPIST: I mean again, Brian, I think it\u2019s like... I keep saying about the transition from high school to college, when things are going ordinarily and healthily, that it is so sad to say goodbye to your family, to say... your friends and moving off to college. It\u2019s... things are changing. It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B1\">high school anymore. You will never be with that group in exactly the same way ever again even though you might keep in touch. It\u2019s sad. And you absolutely would not have it any other way because you\u2019re so ready for the next step.  The excitement about the forward momentum is running the show. And that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B2\">sounds like this is just part of what makes this sound so healthy for you, is it... that\u2019s what this feels like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">THERAPIST: I think there will be sadness, moments, even if it\u2019s just the night before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">CLIENT: Of course. No, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s not the same as melancholy or depression. It just... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">CLIENT: No, no, it\u2019s not. I mean even when I... I\u2019m in the apartment. Well, I guess I really have to slowly start. I mean I don\u2019t really have anything in there so I\u2019m leaving it to the week of or whatever, two weeks, whatever, next week, whatever. But I\u2019m like wow, I\u2019m going to have to empty all these <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201251\">drawers and whatever. It\u2019s like a pang, you know what I mean? But then I\u2019m like yeah, I\u2019ve got to empty these drawers. So in some ways it\u2019s... honestly, it\u2019s a relief in some ways. It\u2019s been a shitty nine months so I\u2019m just ready for a change.  I mean shitty employment wise and not shitty in a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201252\">other ways. But between the unemployment and coming to terms with working and here and coming to terms with the family stuff, those two things are enough to make it like all right, look, it\u2019s time to start a new chapter and all this good stuff will be here and... but it\u2019s... I\u2019m more than ready to be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] you\u2019ve been working tremendously hard coming into real time, reality, really who you are, that you\u2019re not someone who [inaudible] your mother [inaudible] And all of those things are part of what is creating this next step, is you in real time being yourself and finding what is <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201271\">a pathway that\u2019s actually [inaudible] for you.  In other words. Brian, I\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s not just this year\u2019s been so hard I have to get the hell out of Dodge...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it\u2019s not an escape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">THERAPIST: This is... it actually is you growing up in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, well it\u2019s when I say I am getting the hell out of Dodge it\u2019s not like I\u2019m running away. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve sat down, I\u2019ve thought this out, processed it, I\u2019m going to write a fucking essay about it and tell you why I\u2019m going. And also tell you why I know that yeah, I get it that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D1\">where I\u2019m going isn\u2019t an answer.  It\u2019s not some kind of panacea or whatever. It\u2019s a fucking place. But it is a different possibility. That\u2019s all. You know David Foster Wallace? I don\u2019t really like his novels and I feel bad because then he fucking killed himself, and I used to make fun of him a lot, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D2\">but his essays are incredibly brilliant. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve read any of his essays or anything, but he has this one where he says, I don\u2019t remember, but... and they\u2019re very sublime. It\u2019s very beautiful but he...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Do you know what it\u2019s called?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s on creativity and writing or something like that. But basically he says all loneliness and all... loneliness and something else, ahh fuck, I don\u2019t remember it.  But he says these two things, all they are, are just fear, a fear of death, right, a fear <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201311\">of... and I\u2019ve said this here before, a lot, right. All... that\u2019s what all... that\u2019s why it\u2019s been hard to let go of my... on some level. And he\u2019s like... and the way he ties that in is to... so I mean it\u2019s much more articulate than I can say it now, but just the idea that that\u2019s the paradox of art <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201312\">and writing, is that you\u2019re allowing the reader to step into this other consciousness while also knowing that we\u2019re all going to die alone and miserably. But you\u2019re willing... but the... so he\u2019s like... so the artist, in a way, has to allow themselves to die in the process of making that art, if they <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201313\">want to make good art.  So that that other person can kind of enter that world and forget for a while that this is going to enrich me or I\u2019m being whatever while also knowing that I\u2019m really scared of being alone and whatever. So really that\u2019s... I think that\u2019s a lot of what\u2019s happening here is that... <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201314\">so his whole point, basically, is you\u2019ve just got to... it\u2019s only when you face it that it\u2019s possible to go get beyond it. And I think that\u2019s what this is. You know what I mean? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m quite there yet but it\u2019s a big, big... yeah. It\u2019s very different than it was a year ago or whatever. He\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">THERAPIST: Well more of the feelings around the separation and loss and embracing alone can come up when you\u2019re actually there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] say I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m there yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course. And that\u2019s going to happen anyway because I... every single person has said that. They\u2019re like then you\u2019re going to hit this other point, this... where you\u2019re like... you feel alone, you feel isolated, it starts hitting you that you\u2019re in a little landlocked country in the middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201391\">of fucking nowhere. They\u2019re like stuff like that will start bothering you. I\u2019m hoping that creativity, the work I\u2019ll be doing, will just help me process that. Yeah. And also, see, it\u2019s not... I mean I have no way of knowing until I\u2019m there but there... just something feels different about the... when <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201392\">you think like well yeah, but yes, I will feel those things but to feel those things that drastically, it makes it sound like you\u2019re in some God damn prison.  I\u2019m an American with an American passport. I will get on the plane and come back. I mean it\u2019s hard for me to... I get that that will happen, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201393\">there\u2019s no question that\u2019s going to happen, but I just don\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20138-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20138-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562554\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Well [inaudible] here, too, Brian. That\u2019s somewhat of a fantasy, also, that you\u2019ll then be deadlocked there in loneliness but not here. You\u2019ve felt that here too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? In other words it\u2019s... the loneliness is inside you<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20141\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. No, that part I get. But just this idea that... yes, I mean I get that. This is home. So if I\u2019m lonely here it\u2019s not like I can be like well that\u2019s fine. I can get a ticket and go... no, this is home so you\u2019ve got to work that out somehow.  But the idea that Philip [ph] started <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201411\">feeling isolated in Assyria, I get that I will feel that way. No doubt. I\u2019m sure these fucking Assyrians, a lot of them are going to annoy me and all that. I get it. But I also just... I\u2019m like well, but that\u2019s the whole point though. I went there... I\u2019ve constructed this whole fucking thing, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201412\">I\u2019m not... I\u2019ve taken a full time job, I\u2019m making a permanent move to Assyria, I\u2019m going to teach for a summer and a semester. If it goes great, great. If it doesn\u2019t, that shit\u2019s going on my CD and I\u2019m coming back. So it\u2019s hard for me to be like I\u2019m going to have a whole month or I\u2019m not going to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201413\">a ton... in a way I don\u2019t have time to feel that because in my mind I\u2019m already counting down to coming back in a way. Do you know what I mean? So that\u2019s what\u2019s... it\u2019s not like grad school, like some indefinite PhD, whatever. I\u2019m there on a contract. And they would love to have me stay and I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201414\">love to stay.
