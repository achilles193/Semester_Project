AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: This is session 14, final session for transcription. It is Monday, the 28th of January, 2014. Hi, Jessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Hi, Debbie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So, this is the final session of this chapter of your first experience with REBT therapy. And you\u2019ve done really, really well. But before sharing further thoughts, I would like for us to look at you did with the homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Which was \u2013 just to refresh \u2013 the first was inviting you to think of strategies that you can use when you\u2019re alone, both when you\u2019re in a good space and also if you find yourself relapsing into panic, anxiety, or other unhealthy emotions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">Then, the second thing was inviting you to organize or prep any questions or comments about the work we\u2019ve done together, about REBT, and so forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">Thirdly, it was inviting you to reflect and make notes on gains that you have noticed, advantages and changes since you\u2019ve been using REBT. And just a reminder that a main stated goal when we started was for you to reduce \u2013 best case would be eliminate \u2013 anxiety and panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: In the course of sessions, another important goal emerged.  And that was the importance of your increasing your unconditional self-acceptance. And that\u2019s pretty common in the course of many therapies, that you might start out with one goal and then things are revealed and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:02:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: and it then appears that you would benefit from working on additional ones, which you\u2019ve done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">So, then I invited you, as part of that third area of homework, to make notes of changes in yourself, in your thinking, in your behavior since doing the REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And another part of suggested homework from last week: to note any noteworthy revelations which emerged during, or as a result of, our sessions. I remember that, a few times, some may be on the transcripts and some you may have just said as we were saying \u201chello,\u201d or, \u201cgood-bye,\u201d and not recorded.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">You have told me that you have noticed changes and whole new understandings and appreciation for REBT which dispelled some serious misconceptions about it \u2013 which, by the way, I think that, unfortunately, many other people share because they haven\u2019t been taught it accurately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Sure, sure, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m interested to hear what you say. And then finally, regarding your homework, to express your goals and intentions regarding your emotional \u2013 and other \u2013 well-being going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">Towards the end of our session tonight, I\u2019m going to give you these pages of information, written by my husband \u2013 Albert Ellis \u2013 and we worked on them together, on the revision \u2013 points here, in written form, for you to keep and you can go over them a million times: about how to maintain and enhance <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">your REBT gains !  So, we\u2019ll look at that at the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">So, there is the agenda; over to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Okay. Well, first, let me start off by saying that I\u2019m very, I\u2019m very sad that it\u2019s our last session today, but I will survive. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Indeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay. I just wanted to let you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Are you sure about that? (Joking)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yes, I am. I am sure. But I am very, very sad, which \u2013 if I remember correctly \u2013 is a\u2014that\u2019s an emotion that we can still experience. But it\u2019s not debilitating; I\u2019m just feeling sadness and not letting it get in the way of my\u2014what I\u2019m doing and, in fact, I have a lot of things coming up this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">week. I\u2019m thinking, obviously, my head is on the surgery that\u2019s coming up on Thursday. But at the same time, I feel it\u2019s all related and it\u2019s bittersweet; it\u2019s bittersweet that our final session\u2014not like I\u2019m saying \u201cgood-bye\u201d to you, because \u2013 as we\u2019ve mentioned on the tape before \u2013 that we do live <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">in close proximity\u2014we\u2019ve seen each other around, I know I\u2019ll see you and wave and things like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Plus, as I\u2019ll mention later, it\u2019s fine and it\u2019s on this information page that I\u2019m going to give you that if you do at any point get bogged down\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I can e-mail you or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s not a law preventing more sessions ! So\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Oh, oh! okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:05:35) REBT isn\u2019t like a brief taste and then it\u2019s over. But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Got you, got you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: it now gives you a chance to see how you go\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: practicing it on your own, taking responsibility on your own, for your emotional well-being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well, exactly, exactly. And I think that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s like you get your wings and then you\u2014ooh, I don\u2019t want to say that right now, but\u2014[laughs] My point was that it\u2019s bittersweet. And that I am sad. But, at the same time, I feel like this has been really, really beneficial for me. And I know that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">I have to\u2014in order to maintain the philosophies, that that\u2019s something that the work that I need to put in. I\u2019m aware of that and I\u2019ll continue to read. I think that\u2019s a really big part\u2014anyway, but going back to the agenda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">So, basically, we had talked about\u2014you asked, originally, what I can do when I\u2019m in these moments of\u2014where the REBT would fit into my life, that\u2019s how I interpreted that first part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well, it was strategies\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Strategies, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: you can use if you\u2019re alone \u2013 both when you\u2019re in a healthy, self-sufficient state\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Or also in . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Or convalescing, because in a few days, you\u2019re having surgery and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: being a very active woman who already, in the past seven months, has been restricted\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: you will be more restricted, but not for seven months.  In any case, it\u2019s a grand adventure and opportunity for you to practice patience\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yes, it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: and reminding yourself it\u2019s temporary, and for the wider good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: For the longer good in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. So, what I talked about here, in my homework, is that I said for strategies, that I would do\u2014I would identify the activating event and that I would first\u2014so, I would really try to hone in on what it is. And sometimes I feel like it could be more than one but what I\u2019ve learned <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">to do is prioritize to figure out that there generally tends to be one that might be the one most large.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">And so, I would identify that\u2014or there could be more than one. And I can do that, as well. But taking it easy and telling myself what the consequences are after determining what the activating event is or recognizing it. And then here, I said, in the homework where I wrote it down, I just said, \u201cExample: <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">surgery coming up.\u201d So, I just use an activating event. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re interested in hearing right now, but I did go over\u2014I did do one full, one complete\u2014what do we call it? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: ABC self-help form.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: ABC, yeah. So, would you like to hear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Very quickly, just so we can fit everything else in. Yes, I would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Sure. I\u2019ll say it quickly, because it came a little bit more naturally this time around. So, I just said\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Take note of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I did, I was very\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: It felt easier to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Notice that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: It was. It was a great\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: what you just said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: It was a great feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: And the more often you keep reading \u2013 as you expressed, as few minutes ago, you intend to do \u2013 and practicing it, the more often it will be easier\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: And easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Exactly. So, hooray. Anyway, let\u2019s hear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: So, I\u2019ll just go through it kind of quickly. So I said, \u201cSurgery coming up.\u201d So I said, \u201cWorried, fear of the\u2014\u201d The activating event was that my mother was on the phone and she said that she knows somebody \u2013 a brother\u2019s friend of mine \u2013 who\u2019s getting the same surgery. And she said, \u201cAnd he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">going back to work in four days.\u201d Okay. So I thought that was the activating event, because I\u2019m already concerned, right?  The consequences were: worry, fear of unknown, regret before it even happens, anticipatory anxiety, perservation\u2014I don\u2019t know what that is. I have no idea what I wrote\u2014leading to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F2\">anxiety. Perservation . . . ? I don\u2019t know\u2014leading to anxiety and free-floating unease. That was some of the consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">Then I said what I can do is I can write down what I\u2019m brewing over in my head, write down my experience\u2014writing it down \u2013 that\u2019s the strategy \u2013 helps me to gain clarity and insight and realize how debilitating the anxiety can be. And then I will focus on my irrational beliefs. I\u2019m just reading what I wrote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: So, this isn\u2019t an ABC exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: It is. I was writing the strategies and just throwing\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Okay. Because what you just said is what you can do. And I haven\u2019t heard the irrational beliefs yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay, here they are. Sorry. Yes, here they are. Okay, so, I need the surgery to reduce my pain\u2014where are the irrational beliefs?

What can you do in that moment, realistically, to turn the dial right down on that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">CLIENT: Well, what I tell my students: I can stop and think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">CLIENT: Stop and think. Don\u2019t just jump. You can take a minute. Unless you\u2019re under the gun, literally, or someone has a knife at you, you might not have time to stop and think then. But in most circumstances in life, we\u2019re given the benefit and the opportunity to be able to stop, take a breath, be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201731\">like, \u201cOkay. Let me think about this for a minute.\u201d And then make a plan or have a thought or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">And that\u2019s not to say that the reaction wouldn\u2019t be still more of a heightened reaction, but it could be much less if I give myself that chance to just stop for a minute: thinking it will get resolved, there\u2019s got to be a way. And empower myself is how I look at it, because I think that in the past, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201751\">some of my tendencies have been because I didn\u2019t feel that there would be a way to resolve it. And that somebody would have to come and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20174-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20174-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Rescue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: rescue me or help me to fix it. And those have been my tendencies. So, I think I now have that awareness. I did it today. I actually had an incident where I did it today. And I didn\u2019t panic\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Did what today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: Where I had a stop and think moment. And I told my doctor. My actual\u2014PCP. \u201cHold on a minute.\u201d And he went, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath, come down here.\u201d It was a long story; I don\u2019t have to get into it now. But he basically said, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath. Come down here right now, come get checked <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D1\">out.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, no.\u201d I said, \u201cLet me just take care of a few things.\u201d  And I went and called the secretary and I said, \u201cI took care of this.\u201d And then I called him back and he went, \u201cOh.\u201d It\u2019s just funny, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">And not that I need to impress him but there has been some nice impressions that even people that I\u2019ve \u2013 in the past \u2013 maybe put on pedestals realize that they don\u2019t have all the answers. They don\u2019t know everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">And he said, \u201cOh, well, okay. If that\u2019s case,\u201d he said, \u201cthank you for investigating.\u201d He said, \u201cAnd you\u2019re not alone in this problem,\u201d that had occurred without getting into it, so . . . today. I think, given this \u2013 I don\u2019t want to call it \u201cillness,\u201d but it basically is; it has been an illness \u2013 has <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201811\">given me opportunities with using REBT, because I\u2019ve been faced with not just everyday bullcrap, what we go through that we can very easily get into daily routines but life\u2019s thrown me a couple of curveballs, in terms of things that have come up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: Major ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: Major ones. And I\u2019ve been able to, in certain situations, be able to impress myself [laughs] by saying, \u201cOkay, that was pretty good, Jessa. You have more knowledge and resources than you think.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: And the ability to apply what you\u2019ve newly learned \u2013 successfully\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">THERAPIST: much of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: So, I was just thinking about that because that did happen today. Instead of having that automatic panic \u2013 which could have easily\u2014I could have gone down that road. If I allowed myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yes, which is the road you used to habitually go down a lot of the time \u2013 not all the time, probably, but a lot of the time \u2013 without questioning. And, by the way, that is a very common aspect of the human condition, of humans who aren\u2019t working on being more aware and helping themselves. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201931\">And I\u2019ve said before, at various times: with awareness can come change. If you\u2019re not aware there\u2019s a problem, how\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: How are you going to fix it? Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: you focus your energy\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: They say it in AA, the first thing is\u2014the first step is saying, \u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic,\u201d and then you move on from there.  So . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: So, indeed, and what a lot of people do, who have been in the habit of not questioning their thinking, when something happens that\u2019s adverse and they find themselves in fear or panic, there\u2019s kind of literally a [gasps] gasp, a holding of the breath. The body tightens, and so on. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B1\">like arrested development. And they carry on regardless. They might find distractions or turn to healthy or unhealthy distractions. And don\u2019t ever look for the root cause, bring it up and out, and eliminate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2019A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">And so a lot of people put a heavy, metal lid on the panic.  They just push it down and not want to investigate further. And that doesn\u2019t prevent them from thinking the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Denial?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: things\u2014yes, you could call it denial. And that does nothing to prevent us from keeping on doing that for the rest of life. But from now on, you \u2013 as long as you intend to \u2013 will have the choice \u2013 as often as you remember to \u2013 to NOT succumb to the ideas and notions that brutally hurt you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Okay, very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: [giggles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: So, that was one. Unless you have anything more to say about homework number one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: No, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: No. Good. So, do you feel prepared to handle any debilitating emotion that comes up? And right now, in theory, do you have clear strategies in your head of, \u201cWhat I can do if and when\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: Most, yes. Not\u2014I mean, I think\u2014I can\u2019t say all the time, but this is the go-to resource that I would use. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Sounds good. All right, number two: prep any questions you have\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Questions for me, about REBT\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">THERAPIST: about therapy, and any related issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT: Okay, so, I know we\u2019ve addressed this in the past but just being that it\u2019s closer to my surgery, and so, the pain has been completely debilitating on certain days \u2013 and at night, especially. So, my question is: REBT related to severe, chronic pain, I feel it has affected me differently when <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB1\">I\u2019m horrific pain and I can\u2019t think as clearly or positively. Do you have suggestions? Or can you elaborate a little bit more on when that pain is gut-wrenching \u2013 which, I\u2019m going to use that word because it has been that \u2013 suggestions for what to do? Or what to do\u2014how to\u2014do I need to do something differently <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB2\">because of that or . . . when my brain is just overtaken by pain \u2013 which, unfortunately, has happened. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Well, your brain won\u2019t feel the pain. Your body will feel the pain and your brain registers it and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">THERAPIST: you\u2019re indicating that, when you feel that pain\u2014am I right in what I\u2019m about to say? That you are looking at whether just the brain, you suspect, may not cooperate with the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">THERAPIST: ABCs and the REBT approach? And asking what you can do about the pain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Well, first of all, particularly post-surgery \u2013 and you\u2019ve indicated you rather trust this particular surgeon doctor\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">CLIENT: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: so, that\u2019s certainly a question on a purely biological, physical, neurological level. Ask him, \u201cWhat do I do about the pain?\u201d Post-surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Oh, oh, oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">CLIENT: Well, he\u2019ll say, \u201cTake pain medication,\u201d which I\u2019ve talked to him about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Which may be the helpful thing to do. Because if you can get your body to a state where your mind is not so distracted by the pain, then you can more easily \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it will be easy, but it will be easier for you\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">THERAPIST: to then think about your thinking. So, step one, when the pain is very severe, is to address that. And get advice from someone who knows. In this case, the most appropriate person to ask about post-surgery pain is the doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">The second thing I suggest \u2013 which I attempted [chuckles] to do with you in a past session \u2013 was the relaxation meditation, or progressive body relaxation. Which many, many people practice to lessen their pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Relaxation meditation or progressive muscle relaxation.  So, referring to the second one [chuckles] first, the progressive muscle relaxation is simply taking your awareness to every part of your body and just consciously intending, directing, suggesting to that part of you, \u201cRelax. Relax. Relax.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">Then, the first suggestion [chuckles] which I mentioned was relaxation visualization meditation, where you visualize. One popular one for people who are visual is to imagine a soothing color just oozing down from the top of their head and filling every part of the body. And you see it in graphic detail, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E11\">whatever your color is. It may be a gold color, and a bit of a warm, molten gold and a healing yellow color, and you see it going through. It enters your body from the crown of your head And you see it flowing down through every part of you, just relaxing every cell. And you let your body drop all effort. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E12\">And it\u2019s a good idea, when you do this, to either lie flat on or your back or, if you\u2019re sitting up, to consciously get in a relaxed posture. Uncross your legs, uncross your arms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">So, a strategy that helps a lot of people\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">THERAPIST: when they\u2019re in pain is the visualization or the progressive relaxation and\/or both. I mean, you can do each at different times. Find what you respond most successfully to. And it\u2019s a very good idea to do this even when you\u2019re not in pain. It\u2019s a lovely way to go to sleep. Again, imagine <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E71\">\u2013 maybe it\u2019s a beautiful sky blue color that enters the top of your head and moves down through every part of you before you go to sleep.  Even when you\u2019re not in pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">I recommend daily meditation \u2013 even if it\u2019s only for a few minutes \u2013 in a form that you embrace comfortably every day when possible. And it may not be possible to do it every day, but it\u2019s a good idea to do it as often as you can \u2013 even for a few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED\">THERAPIST: There is a great amount of research \u2013 scientific research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Gene expression changes based on meditation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">THERAPIST: So, I recommend making meditation\/relaxation a part of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\">THERAPIST: And in response to the question you asked: when in pain, before you\u2019re in pain, and post-surgery, my recommendation would be done in addition to whatever your doctor recommends, because your body will be in some sort of different state after the surgery. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">THERAPIST: So, use both\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">THERAPIST: after surgery. Not medication for the rest of your life. [chuckles]. But meditation \u2013 that would be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">CLIENT: Sure. Sure, sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">THERAPIST: Okay. Any other questions, comments?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20203\">CLIENT: Oh. Okay, so, let\u2019s see. Okay, how often would you say it is beneficial to document\u2014what did I write here documenting or journaling your thoughts in order to train your brain differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20205\">THERAPIST: As often as possible. Some people write in a journal every night. If you can do that, all the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20207\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">THERAPIST: Whenever possible. By the way, going back to strategies.

What to do? There\u2019s a relaxation. There\u2019s a meditation. There\u2019s distraction, which could include funny movies, good books, a walk in nature \u2013 again, if the pain isn\u2019t too severe. And seek appropriate medication \u2013 not instead of the above \u2013 in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202211\">addition to it \u2013 for when pain is severe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20223\">CLIENT: Okay. Any suggestions on how to best use REBT when too many thoughts are happening at once and it\u2019s hard to get to the place of relaxing your mind in order to decipher the thoughts and then dispute them, i.e., catastrophizing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20225\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Good on you for asking that question, because that is really pertinent\u2014by the way, not only to you \u2013 a lot of people. But in asking that question, you have recognized that that is a tendency of yours.  And we\u2019ve talked about it in some of the sessions in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20227\">So, conscious focus is what can be done. Focus, intending to watch your mind and be master of it rather than succumb to its whims and habits. It takes discipline, which you\u2019ve demonstrated that you have. And intention, which you\u2019ve demonstrated that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20229\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022B\">THERAPIST: And then, increasing the habit of thinking about your thinking, of being aware. I may have mentioned it before that Al used to say, \u201cAs far as we know, many animals think. But as far as we know, humans may be\u2014\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D\">CLIENT: [That\u2019s most animals]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">THERAPIST: \u201cthe only ones who can think about their thinking.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">CLIENT: Right, right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">THERAPIST: Even think about thinking about their thinking !<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">THERAPIST: And research has shown that people who meditate every day find it easier in their daily wakeful life\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">THERAPIST: to be more mindful and focused on one thing at a time. So, I would say, as a preventative, it would be very beneficial to you to meditate each day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">THERAPIST: To increase, enjoy and have that core of inner peacefulness and stability as much as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">THERAPIST: And, also, intend every day to watch your thinking. Have that intention. And intend to just say, \u201cStop!\u201d when you are thinking in unhelpful ways as you might tell your students to do, at times \u2013 not necessarily when they\u2019re thinking too many thoughts but when they\u2019re thinking unhelpful thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">But now I\u2019m suggesting you do that either when you\u2019re thinking unhelpful thoughts\u2014pause and think about\u2014and also remind yourself: FOCUS. Think: \u201cWow, look, I\u2019m thinking about this, this, this,\u201d \u201cHang on!\u201d say to yourself: \u201cJust one thing at a time\u201d. And it\u2019s a matter of conscious choice and discipline. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202431\">You can do it. If you choose to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">THERAPIST: A possible reason that you won\u2019t is\u2014I don\u2019t want to use the word \u201dlaziness\u201d which sounds like a bit of a\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20246-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20246-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20249\">CLIENT: Hm-mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024B\">THERAPIST: critical word here, but your just not doing it due to that or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024D\">CLIENT: No, I think it would be laziness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">THERAPIST: Or Forgetfulness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">CLIENT: Forgetfulness or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">THERAPIST: Not intending strongly enough to do it. Insufficient dedication to the task.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. I try to steer away from the word \u201claziness,\u201d because I don\u2019t\u2014I think it\u2019s that\u2014it\u2019s more helpful being kind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">THERAPIST: Alright, so, kindly be firm with your mind when it\u2019s on a trip in nine different directions in one millisecond. And firmly and kindly and firmly say, for example, \u201cStop. Okay. I\u2019m going to think about this now. I\u2019m going to do this now. Look, I\u2019m writing a note about it so I don\u2019t forget. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202571\">At 6:00 p.m., I\u2019ll come back to that issue.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re just lovingly firm. Anything else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">CLIENT: [chuckles] On questions, no. That was\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">CLIENT: you know my tendencies to ask a lot of questions, so I just kept it brief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">THERAPIST: All right. But if there\u2019s some pressing question -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">CLIENT: No, no, no, because I think\u2014I mean, I had one other question, and I said\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">THERAPIST: Yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">CLIENT: and I went back and forth in terms of asking this, but I am just curious \u2013 and if you have an answer to this or some thought to it\u2014not a definite answer, but a thought. I\u2019m just curious: people that\u2014if someone in their life hasn\u2019t done REBT, if they haven\u2019t been trained\u2014do you know what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202691\">going to ask ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure. I suspect I might.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">CLIENT: Okay. Okay. If they haven\u2019t been trained, how is that they can still\u2014that they\u2019ve developed and become this very healthy\u2014because there are healthy people out there that have not done REBT. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">So, I guess my question is: those people that I look to and maybe modeled or said\u2014I can even think of just friends that I\u2019ve had, over the years, or coworkers that are very\u2014just are healthy thinkers. You could tell, just in their daily way of life that they are. If they didn\u2019t have REBT, how do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F1\">suspect that they got to that place of just thinking in that way but yet not ever being trained?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">THERAPIST: Well, REBT doesn\u2019t have the monopoly on wisdom. It does express it very clearly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">CLIENT: I understand, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">THERAPIST: My husband had a gift for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">CLIENT: Okay, got you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20279\">THERAPIST: And so, it sounds like the people you\u2019re asking about are bright and wise. They may have also read things and selected the goodies that were healthy to think about and\/or apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027D\">THERAPIST: And maybe they also had healthy models in their lives. Maybe they don\u2019t use the REBT terms and language, but they practice the principles: that is what you\u2019re indicating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027F\">CLIENT: That makes sense, yep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20281\">THERAPIST: Buddhism has many similar principles within it as REBT. So, there may be other approaches that they have studied or consciously embraced and they use the principles in those that are akin to REBT ones. If it works, wonderful. The goal is to enjoy this life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20283\">CLIENT: Life, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20285\">THERAPIST: This life, that passes so quickly. To enjoy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20287\">CLIENT: Exactly. Okay. That was my other question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20289\">THERAPIST: Okay, all right. So, then, homework number three: make notes of gains you have made using REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028B\">CLIENT: Okay, so, I just wrote a few things so I could share. I just said: I am more lighthearted, more easy-going about some of life\u2019s circumstances. I\u2019m more able to go with the flow. I\u2019m not catastrophizing as much as I did\u2014I don\u2019t catastrophize as much as I did in the past. I\u2019m able to stop and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2028B1\">think a little more. I\u2019m able to dissect my thoughts, dispute them more thoroughly, and gain more clarity.  I have lessened my expectations so that when something good happens, I\u2019m more grateful. I\u2019m a little neurotic. [laughs] I\u2019m okay with still continuing to work on my neurotic behaviors or tendencies, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2028B2\">because I have a choice. I\u2019m more\u2014hold on, what did I write here? I\u2019m more . . . gosh, I really do love my own handwriting. And it\u2019s funny, when I\u2019m writing these days about myself, it\u2019s more compassionate, I guess? More unconditional acceptance.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2028A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019ll do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">CLIENT: Okay.

I\u2019m a little less hesitant to express my feelings without worrying over what the other person\u2019s response will be later.  I have more unconditional self-acceptance, more unconditional other acceptance. I understand the human limitation. And I\u2019m less quick to put <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202AB1\">someone on a pedestal, recognizing that they\u2019re just a fallible human \u2013 just like myself. And I\u2019m less inclined to anger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AD\">I feel like I\u2019m going to cry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202AF\">THERAPIST: You can let yourself cry Jessa.

You said, \u201cI can wait for the gift of healing.\u201d Meaning \u2013 after the surgery. It\u2019s already begun. You\u2019ve made a decision. The surgery is going to bring you healing, that\u2019s the first physical step of the healing process. You\u2019ve already started. Now, with this healthy way of thinking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202EF1\">Jessa, you will be creating fewer of those harmful chemicals in the body \u2013 adrenaline and others you can read about \u2013 that can inhibit or retard healing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F1\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F3\">THERAPIST: By keeping your thinking healthy, that will affect your physical healing, as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F5\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F7\">THERAPIST: Chemically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F9\">CLIENT: Exactly.

You \u201cshould\u201d have caught me !!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030D\">CLIENT: I was thinking about how much I love showers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030F\">THERAPIST: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20311\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not allowed, by the doctor\u2019s orders, to shower for five days after my surgery. So, I got baby wipes so that\u2019ll suffice but I might smell a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20313\">THERAPIST: If your cats want to leave home due to the stench, I\u2019ll cat-sit them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20315\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20314-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20314-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20317\">THERAPIST: They\u2019ll meouw: \u201cShe stinks. I can\u2019t live with her anymore.\u201d All right, great. Okay, so, next \u2026Back to homework you did -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20319\">We are talking about gains you\u2019ve made using REBT. Any additional ones there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031B\">CLIENT: No, that was what I wrote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031D\">THERAPIST: That was that, then. Make notes of \u2013 this is part two of homework three \u2013 changes\u2014which you\u2019ve somewhat answered, maybe you put them all together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2031F\">CLIENT: I put it all together, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20321\">THERAPIST: Changes in you, particularly with regard to anxiety, which was the emotion mentioned in session one as the main one \u2013 anxiety, panic \u2013 that you wanted to change, eliminate, and reduce. So, you have touched on it already this session, but do you want to, again, just verbalize \u2013 briefly\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20323\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20325\">THERAPIST: the progress you feel regarding your tendency, in the past, to create quick anxiety and severe panic? And you have mentioned it today, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20327\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I\u2019m good. Unless there\u2019s something you want me to share, but I think it\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20329\">THERAPIST: So, during the weeks of using and working on applying REBT, you\u2019ve succeeded in lessening it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032B\">CLIENT: Lessening it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032D\">THERAPIST: And are you comfortable that you have the ability to keep working on it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2032F\">CLIENT: Absolutely, absolutely. I see, now, that it\u2019s a lot\u2014that anxiety is\u2014there\u2019s situations that happen and then there\u2019s what we choose to do with those situations, our minds. And how powerful\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20331\">THERAPIST: And how we think. We can choose the way we think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20333\">CLIENT: that is and that we can definitely create\u2014there are situations that can, just by themselves, create some anxiety and then it\u2019s our choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20335\">THERAPIST: No, no, no! Situations don\u2019t create anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20337\">CLIENT: Oh, well, I guess I meant that if someone\u2014I\u2019m thinking more extreme again, there I go. [chuckles] But either way, it\u2019s something that we have choice, in order to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20339\">THERAPIST: Choice about what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2033B\">CLIENT: Of what we tell ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2033D\">THERAPIST: Exactly. That\u2019s the bottom line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2033F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s that inner dialogue in terms of how we handle situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20341\">THERAPIST: So, you already shared with me you find yourself doing\u2014creating it less\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20343\">CLIENT: Yes, I\u2019m anxious less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20345\">THERAPIST: and attending to the thoughts more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20347\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20349\">THERAPIST: Keep it up, would be my encouragement. All right. And then, next homework again, you may have already bundled this together, part three of homework\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2034B\">CLIENT: I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2034D\">THERAPIST: three was any noteworthy revelations. You shared the one you had in the shower\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2034F\">CLIENT: I have something else, now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20351\">THERAPIST: Which emerged during or as a result of our sessions, yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20353\">CLIENT: I actually did, just as part of revelation, I was on the airplane in\u2014gosh, when was this, that I went to\u2014I was with Madeline, where did\u2014we were flying in the summertime. So, there was a book that I\u2019d had, some spiritual\u2014I\u2019m very much into that, a lot of that spiritual type of stuff. And so, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203531\">one of the things that it said was to write down all the things that you\u2019re not and then the negative patterns that come with it, and then all of the things that you are. That was what had been said by the book.  And it\u2019s just funny, because I found it. Things I wrote. As you can see, it was from the <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203532\">airplane, because it\u2019s on one of those\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20355\">THERAPIST: Vomit bags !<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20357\">CLIENT: Bags you use if you get sick. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20359\">THERAPIST: I hope it\u2019s empty right now !<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20358-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20358-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035B\">CLIENT: [laughs] That\u2019s funny. Well, I didn\u2019t have any paper, so, I had to get creative. So, anyway, I just wanted to share this because I just thought it was interesting that it was so extreme to say all the\u2014in that, to say all the things you\u2019re not. And I\u2019m looking at it now very differently, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2035B1\">I was so steadfast when I was writing it at the time. Can I share, if I may? Because this was back in August, so it\u2019s only a few months ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035D\">THERAPIST: Before we started working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035F\">CLIENT: Before we started working together. So, I wrote all the things I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not\u2014this is what I told myself: I\u2019m not patient. I\u2019m not calm. I\u2019m not organized. I\u2019m critical of myself, so I\u2019m not kind to myself, basically. And I\u2019m not decisive, so I\u2019m therefore indecisive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20361\">And all the things I am, I said: I\u2019m sensitive. I\u2019m kind. I\u2019m funny. I\u2019m creative. I\u2019m good with children, pets, and understanding others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20363\">So, again, it said, \u201cNegative patterns that being that way creates.\u201d  And I wrote underneath, where all the things I\u2019m not, I said, \u201cThis creates me to, then, focus more on my weight in a negative way. To control, to have negative thinking or not thinking clearly, to eat my feelings\u201d \u2013 oh my gosh, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203631\">haven\u2019t done that. That\u2019s good, I don\u2019t do that \u2013 and to worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20365\">I\u2019m just looking back at this and thinking of so many things that have changed and I wasn\u2019t aware\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20367\">THERAPIST: That you have changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20369\">CLIENT: That I have changed. And then the positive, they said that what you put in them was a positive substitution replacing the negative of what you could do. And I said, eat healthy\u2014but, again, I was just writing it down. I wasn\u2019t doing anything, I was just writing what I could do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2036B\">So, I wrote, \u201cEat healthy and enjoy the food.\u201d Interestingly enough, without knowing that I had written this, I have changed my diet in the past\u2014since the REBT work I do started. Completely, I\u2019ve taken out chemicals. I\u2019ve taken out processed food.  I eat natural, all healthy, drink just water and tea <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2036B1\">and that\u2019s it. Before, I was having diet peach Snapples, which have aspartame and all of that kind of stuff and \u201ccrap,\u201d I\u2019d say. So, I\u2019ve changed that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2036D\">\u201cLive in the moment and let things be.\u201d That was one of the positive substitutions. I feel like I\u2019ve definitely been able to do a lot more of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2036F\">\u201cChanging the thought,\u201d that was a positive substitution. At that time, I was not allowing myself to do that. I just was wishful but wasn\u2019t doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20371\">And then, this other one, here, was, \u201cTake deep breaths,\u201d which, again, is something I\u2019ve been working on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20373\">So, in a way, it was REBT in some way, without realizing it. But not taking it to that next level. It was without disputing the thoughts, without that piece of it. So, I wrote it on a vomit bag ! and wasn\u2019t really sure what I was going to do with it after. And now, I\u2019ve been able to use REBT to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203731\">those changes I wrote about, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20375\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20377\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a revelation .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20379\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2037B\">CLIENT: Because that was in August. And I can remember where I was, in my head, in the frame of mind that I couldn\u2019t get out of things. That I didn\u2019t have hope\u2014I felt stuck. Clearly, I have this upcoming surgery. I have been in physical pain, I have\u2014but I\u2019ve made a lot of decisions. And I put \u201cindecisive\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2037B1\">there and I don\u2019t think that is the same now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N2037A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2037A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2037D\">THERAPIST: You can rip that sick bag up now, if you choose, if you want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2037F\">CLIENT: I like to remind myself of where I was at different points\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20381\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20383\">CLIENT: because it\u2019s still me. It\u2019s not\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20385\">THERAPIST: What is still you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20387\">CLIENT: Well, even though I might have changed my thought patterns or different ways or things, that was \u2013 at one point or another \u2013 that still came from me. So, it\u2019s nice\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20389\">THERAPIST: In the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2038B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it\u2019s nice to be\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2038D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s what you did.

Any other . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20393\">CLIENT: Revelations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20395\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20397\">CLIENT: Yes. One that I think is interesting and I did kind of say it in here: it is that I do not put people on pedestals now. I see people now for\u2014which, in a way, it\u2019s interesting because I\u2014in the past, I would have put the surgeon on such a pedestal. And yes, I mean, he\u2019s good and I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203971\">good but I\u2019m not doing that as much. And, in fact [chuckles] it\u2019s had a little bit of a negative effect, because I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, crap. He\u2019s a human.\u201d [laughs] \u201cHe\u2019s not a superhero\u201d [laughs] But also knowing that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20399\">THERAPIST: \u201cI want the Lord operating on me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2039B\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly, exactly. But I\u2019ve realized that I don\u2019t do that as much because I realized that we\u2019re fallible. And so, with that said, I said, \u201cHe is an expert in his field.\u201d And I\u2019ve been able to remind myself that, yes, he\u2019s not perfect. He is a human. Who knows what he\u2019s like as a husband? <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2039B1\">Who know\u2014I don\u2019t care. He\u2019s trained and this is what he does. And so, let\u2019s hope he has a good day. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2039D\">But I\u2019ve taken down some people off of that pedestal I put them on, and just said, \u201cThis is who they are.\u201d And that they might do things very well but that\u2019s not who they are. Nobody\u2019s perfect, and I think that\u2019s been, in certain ways, a huge realization for me, a huge revelation for me. Because I tended <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2039D1\">to put my parents on this pedestal. And them coming off of the pedestal has been enlightening, in addition to\u2014there were times where it was disappointing to have that realization that, \u201cWait a second. You don\u2019t have the answers that I thought you did?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2039F\">That\u2019s been also a huge revelation. I think probably the biggest is that I\u2019m one, like all of us, a struggling human being, at times. Just having life challenges that we have to deal with that\u2014or we don\u2019t have to, but we choose to deal with them because we want to go on and enjoy our lives. But I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2039F1\">challenges like others. And that I\u2019m not alone. My challenges might look different, but I\u2019m not the only one. And just because I have physical pain, there are people that have emotional pain. Thank God that I don\u2019t have that much emotional pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A1\">THERAPIST: When you work on changing your anxiety and panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean, just from life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A7\">CLIENT: I feel blessed in a lot of ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203A9\">THERAPIST: And that attitude of gratitude \u2013 ugh, I sounded so clich\u00e9-ish then \u2013 but truly, daily reminders of what you\u2019ve got to be grateful for is hugely beneficial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203AB\">CLIENT: I went to the dentist today. He said, \u201cYou have beautiful teeth.\u201d And I said, \u201cThat was the best thing you could have told me today.\u201d I said, \u2018Thank you so much,\u201d because I went thinking I was going to need a crown. But I said to myself, \u201cJessa, you don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d And I went in and he <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N203AB1\">said, \u201cNo, I think your tooth just needs to be shaved down.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N203AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N203AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203AD\">And it was another example of\u2014I could have catastrophized that I had this dentist appointment because my tooth was killing me, which it has been. And it was much better than I thought\u2014I walked out of there relieved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203AF\">THERAPIST: Probably wasn\u2019t \u201ckilling you\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203B1\">CLIENT: Oh, it was really\u2014it was pretty painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203B3\">THERAPIST: Did the tooth come out of your mouth and strangle you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203B5\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203B7\">THERAPIST: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203B9\">CLIENT: My own tooth? No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203BB\">THERAPIST: Yes, I understand. I\u2019m just being unsuccessfully funny. Or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203BD\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203BF\">THERAPIST: Right, so, remembering each day what you\u2019re grateful for is a key component to healthy emotions, and a happier life. A key component.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203C1\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203C3\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019ve shared with you, at one time or another, that my parents went through five years of hell \u2013 literally \u2013 in concentration camps during the Second World War, and survived, made it to Australia to start new lives. And I feel grateful and blessed because my environment was not one <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N203C31\">of trauma and bitterness and, \u201cHow could this have happened to us?\u201d Every day, in one way or another, I saw my mother or father or both just happy \u2013 very often. Grateful for this new life they had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203C5\">CLIENT: Oh my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203C7\">THERAPIST: They survived hell. And had a new safe home. And children. And Australia is a great country to live in. So, gratitude enriches every moment and prevents a maintenance of trauma symptoms, if there have severe past circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203C9\">So, that you feel gratitude is a very good thing. Any other revelations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203CB\">CLIENT: [sighs] Oh, that I\u2019m not\u2014that I haven\u2019t\u2014my tendency has been that I\u2019ve been very unkind to myself. And that I haven\u2019t really treated\u2014not intentionally, not realizing it, not knowing, not\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203CD\">THERAPIST: Not being aware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203CF\">CLIENT: not knowing that that was how I was treating myself. And so, I think that going forward that just to stop and to think and I think that, truthfully, I think is the first step, because if I\u2019m not being kind to myself, then I wouldn\u2019t give myself the opportunity to think differently because <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N203CF1\">it goes hand in hand. I think it\u2019s giving myself that gift to not\u2014and rather than beating the crap out of myself, which I\u2014which anybody could do if they allowed themselves, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D1\">THERAPIST: Which you used to do a lot more in the past, I believe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D5\">THERAPIST: I saw that in my early sessions with you. I witnessed it quite often in those early sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D7\">CLIENT: It was much worse, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203D8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203D9\">THERAPIST: And I have noticed the change, to your credit. So, that\u2019s wonderful. Now Jessa, can you say a few words on the next homework piece, because this has come up before, here or there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203DA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203DB\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203DC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203DD\">THERAPIST: You studied psychology. You went through a long period of psychoanalysis. You studied REBT. You thought you knew what REBT was. And then, you have shared with me \u2013 without specific details \u2013 that, wow, you didn\u2019t realize REBT was the way it really is, as we have practiced it. So, could you <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N203DD1\">briefly share what you now realize on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203DE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203DF\">CLIENT: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N203E0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203E1\">THERAPIST: Share about what you now see REBT is and how your\u2014and\/or what your misconceptions were.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P17-N203E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"16\"><span data-id=\"P17-N203E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":18,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"18\" data-page=\"18\">\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203E2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203E3\">CLIENT: Absolutely, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203E4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203E5\">THERAPIST: And how you now see they were false.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203E7\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203E8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203E9\">THERAPIST: How they were false.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203EA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203EB\">CLIENT: Sure. I went to graduate school in counseling, as you had mentioned, but we did specifically learn the different\u2014each different type of therapy. I just remember REBT \u2013 I believe, I believe it was called CBT when we learned it, cognitive behavioral therapy, because that was how I\u2014and that\u2019s why <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203EB1\">I kept saying that, over and over. Because I don\u2019t know if it was taught that way in school, I\u2019m just telling you what I know. And it may have been REBT but they focused, for whatever reason, more on using that terminology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203EC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203ED\">And so my belief about it was that\u2014my past belief about REBT is that there was not a whole lot of compassion \u2013 I\u2019m just telling you what I thought \u2013 for the client\u2019s issues, whatever they brought to the table and that if they were dealing with whatever they were dealing with \u2013 X, Y, and Z \u2013 that the <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203ED1\">belief that their ways of thinking would be able to change just based on changing their thinking was really strictly how REBT worked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203EF\">That was my understanding of it, not thinking that\u2014and yes, I understand now that REBT doesn\u2019t sit and have you go over, each week, when you go in, what your childhood woes were, all\u2014and I see, now, that\u2014I do see that the benefit to not doing that, because you could\u2014anybody could do that at any point. <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203EF1\">But I also see that REBT has a place for it. Because I think, in the very beginning of our sessions \u2013 and I know we were limited, I\u2019m not seeing you on a\u2014for\u2014I haven\u2019t even seen you more than just 12, 13, whatever sessions\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203F1\">THERAPIST: Fourteen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203F3\">CLIENT: This is today, 14 sessions, but I do remember that, in the very beginning, you got to know me and we dissected where\u2014or understood where the self-criticism came from. And I felt, the whole time that we were working that when I kept going back to that place, you still had compassion as my therapist. <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203F31\">And you knew \u2013 you might not have expressed this to me, to feel badly for me \u2013 but I think you\u2014but you had a sense of, \u201cThat\u2019s probably where that came from with her.\u201d And that the language that\u2014and that my parents were unaware when they did it. And that it was of no fault of theirs, but just that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203F5\">THERAPIST: Their behavior may have been contributing, but they weren\u2019t intending harm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203F7\">CLIENT: Well, they weren\u2019t intending harm. Exactly. It wasn\u2019t meant to hurt. I just think that that was\u2014they didn\u2019t know, really, any different. So, regardless of that, I think you got that as somebody working with me, that when I would go back and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203F9\">THERAPIST: So, you felt empathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203FA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203FB\">CLIENT: I felt that you were empathic with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203FC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203FD\">THERAPIST: Because one misconception I often hear about REBT is empathy is low on the list, and I feel that\u2019s a huge misconception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N203FE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N203FF\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20400\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20401\">THERAPIST: Do you think that in the light of your experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20402\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20403\">CLIENT: Absolutely. I agree that you can do both. I think of what\u2014another misconception, though, is that a lot of people don\u2019t think that you can be empathic and also push people to do good things at the same time\u2014simultaneously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20404\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20405\">THERAPIST: So, what was your experience with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20406\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20407\">CLIENT: That I was more empowered after each session. That I would feel, \u201cI can do this.\u201d Because really, at the end of the day, for children it might look slightly different because they can be more helpless. In certain situations, they might need an adult. I don\u2019t expect a child to walk up and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P18-N20406-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"17\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20406-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":19,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"19\" data-page=\"19\">\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20408\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20409\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re talking about you now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2040A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2040B\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m talking about\u2014the reason\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2040C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2040D\">THERAPIST: Your misconceptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2040E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2040F\">CLIENT: Well, the reason I\u2019m saying that is because I think there is\u2014because I work with children, I think that there is\u2014I\u2019ve taken REBT and just maybe bent it more to work with children. But in my understanding of it is that you can mix compassion and empathy but also empower someone so that it can <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2040F1\">benefit them double-time, that they don\u2019t have to be helpless. I think it can create a learned helplessness when all you have is just compassion and empathy. I\u2019m not saying that about other therapies, I\u2019m just talking strictly about REBT is that it\u2019s you can combine those two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20410\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20411\">And I think that one thing that I would like to maybe share, just in\u2014is that I think with REBT that maybe, just a suggestion, I think that there is maybe\u2014it\u2019s decided in me, but if this is how it works, anyway, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s decided between the therapist and the client in terms of what\u2014or maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N204111\">it\u2019s in the therapist\u2019s best judgment to see how much trauma, maybe, the client has. And for that therapist to intelligently make that decision that they might not be able to push so much with certain things in the beginning, for whatever reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20412\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20413\">THERAPIST: Well, actually, that is taught and recommended in REBT training.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20414\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20415\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20416\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20417\">THERAPIST: That is the way I teach it, and the way my husband taught it and others who practice what they were trained if they were trained by my husband or people he had trained and trusted. And that is that each individual is an individual and you gauge what might be most helpful based on their tendencies <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N204171\">and issues \u2013 and don\u2019t just apply a same-size-fits-all formula.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20418\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20419\">Now, you and I, we\u2019ve laughed a lot in sessions. And I\u2019ve expressed more humorously, more of the time with you, than I might with many of my other clients, simply because initially, I noticed your response. It seemed to enhance the session and your receptivity and seemed helpful for changing your perspective <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N204191\">and seeing things more realistically and for your doing less catastrophizing and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2041A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2041B\">But with another client, in particular, let\u2019s say they were relaying a traumatic event to me. I would not use humor about that. Unless and until I felt there were appropriate moments for the good of that client \u2013 then I would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2041C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2041D\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2041E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2041F\">THERAPIST: Until I felt\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20420\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20421\">CLIENT: They were ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20422\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20423\">THERAPIST: and assessed that they were in a healthier place\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20424\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20425\">CLIENT: Mine was .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20426\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20427\">THERAPIST: and that it would serve them. So, humor isn\u2019t used randomly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20428\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20429\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2042A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2042B\">THERAPIST: An effective REBT therapist does the best they can, being fallible, but intends to do the best they can to do what\u2019s most appropriate for the client\u2019s good. Not to be magnificent REBT practitioners but to be appropriate REBT practitioners in relation to who they\u2019re working with. To help them <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2042B1\">to help themselves as well as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2042C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2042D\">Now you shared, indeed, you know that my husband was notorious for, at times, using strong language and being forceful. You have implied and at times said that I\u2019m quite direct, at times. I can be forceful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2042E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2042F\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s a more directive type of therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20430\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20431\">THERAPIST: Right. It is. And yet, there have been times with you when I have chosen to pull back and be gentler.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P19-N20430-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"18\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20430-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":20,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"20\" data-page=\"20\">\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20432\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20433\">Other times, I\u2019ve been more direct and in your face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20434\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20435\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20436\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20437\">THERAPIST: And, fortunately, it seems that I wasn\u2019t too much off track. And I say that just judging by the results, by your progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20438\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20439\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2043A\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2043B\">THERAPIST: and your receptivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2043C\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2043D\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2043E\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2043F\">THERAPIST: My husband, who was known by some as being so intense and so strong and some called him rather curmudgeonly at times, despite those impressions \u2013 he adjusted his manner and style for the best good for the client. His goal, with regard to the strength and forcefulness of his character, was <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N2043F1\">to shift rigid thinking. When he worked with people who were in a place of deeper suffering, he would modify. I would, without hesitation, say he was brilliant as a therapist, and at practicing what he preached. Not only because he created REBT. There have been some people who created a theory and were <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N2043F2\">not excellent at practicing it, but Albert Ellis did both. And so, yes, there\u2019s modification seen in a skillful REBT therapist\u2019s work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20440\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20441\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20442\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20443\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t blindly just stick to the book and stick to the theory and they\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20444\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20445\">CLIENT: Well, that would be rigid. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20446\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20447\">THERAPIST: That would be very rigid \u2013 anti-REBT ! Okay, so, any other misconceptions about REBT that have been broken as a result of our work and your work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20448\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20449\">CLIENT: Any other misconceptions, is that what you said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2044A\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2044B\">THERAPIST: Myths that you believed before actually applying REBT?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2044C\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2044D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s interesting because, I mean, I still feel\u2014I\u2019ve learned different types of therapy and what came out of it is that I think that therapy is therapy. I mean, I just want to say there\u2019s different types. But I do feel that one of the things that has come out of my knowledge is that of just reading <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N2044D1\">about different therapies, learning different therapies is that a huge piece of it \u2013 and this isn\u2019t really a misconception but it\u2019s \u2013 well, and in a way, it is \u2013 is that there is still much focus on the relationship between client and therapist. And I think that that\u2019s standard for all therapies. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N2044D2\">I maybe was excluding REBT from that, originally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2044E\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2044F\">But I feel like my relationship\u2014that they say that sometimes the healing is just in the relationship, even as a piece of it. Not as the whole thing, but just that being\u2014somebody helping you. I feel like you\u2019ve been\u2014as my REBT therapist, you\u2019ve been there every week to really help me work on my life. <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N2044F1\">And I think that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s like a cheerleader. It\u2019s somebody there, rooting for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20450\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20451\">And so, I think that applies to REBT, as well, which maybe before, it didn\u2019t in my mind. If I envisioned what REBT would look like, I don\u2019t know if I would have thought that as much. I might have thought it was a little bit more robotic, as opposed to including impact from the relationship itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20452\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20453\">And focusing on the fact that, like any type of therapy, that there\u2019s a relationship that\u2019s involved in it. And that there are two people that are working and one is trying to help the other but that the other could help the other\u2014all of that. I think that was maybe a little bit of a misconception that <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N204531\">it didn\u2019t take into account the two people involved as much as I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20454\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20455\">But we didn\u2019t focus on it as much\u2014or maybe I should just say that we didn\u2019t\u2014we focused on it and I never really went that route, for one reason or another. And I\u2019m at a place in my life, now, where I think if a client chooses that type of therapy, then that\u2019s what they\u2019re ready for. Not every therapy <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N204551\">works for every client. So I just think that that\u2019s something that the client would want to talk to the therapist about to consider, if that\u2019s something that they think\u2014I just think some people have to be ready for therapy in general, let alone\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P20-N20454-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"19\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20454-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":21,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"21\" data-page=\"21\">\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20456\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20457\">THERAPIST: It certainly works better when a client chooses to help themselves than when they are kicked into the session, kicking and screaming. [laughs] And there are people who do therapy because they are court-mandated, and for legal reasons<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20458\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20459\">CLIENT: Exactly\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2045A\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2045B\">THERAPIST: Yes, with regard to the client-therapist relationship, certainly REBT appreciates the helpfulness of that healthy, encouraging relationship. But with its goal of empowering the client, the REBT therapist will watch that the client doesn\u2019t make themselves think or feel that they\u2019re dependent <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N2045B1\">on the therapist over the long-term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2045C\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2045D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2045E\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2045F\">THERAPIST: That they will have to always depend on the therapist for their improvement \u2013 that idea is discouraged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20460\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20461\">CLIENT: Well, that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20462\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20463\">THERAPIST: Certainly \u2013 the therapist is there ongoingly if helpful to help with maintenance of gains. For help after relapses. And that comes from caring about the client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20464\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20465\">CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20466\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20467\">THERAPIST: All right, very good. So, we\u2019re at the final point of the homework. And then I\u2019ll say a few things to finish off. Express your goals, Jessa, and intentions regarding your emotional well-being going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20468\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20469\">CLIENT: Well, I think that my goals are to continue to be the very spiritual person that I enjoy being and include REBT\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2046A\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2046B\">THERAPIST: You mean, enjoying the spiritual beliefs that you have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2046C\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2046D\">CLIENT: Enjoying the spiritual beliefs that I have, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2046E\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2046F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a more precise way of putting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20470\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20471\">CLIENT: Okay. To continue to enjoy\u2014yeah, that makes sense. To continue to enjoy the spiritual beliefs but adding now what I know with REBT to that. I feel I\u2019ve been doing that all along, so I want to continue to do that and see how\u2014it\u2019s funny, and I\u2019ll just add this on, because I think it\u2019s important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20472\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20473\">I read the Bible. I read my prayer book. I read it almost ritually. And it\u2019s so funny, because I\u2019ll read it and see REBT principles in the Bible! In certain places. And it amazes me because it talks about unconditional God\u2014I don\u2019t want to put religion\u2014this isn\u2019t about religion, but what I\u2019m saying is <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N204731\">from my own personal experience, is that because I\u2019m somebody who I don\u2019t want to call \u201creligious,\u201d per se, but I do have a faith in God and I do believe in that. And so I\u2019ve been reading different things. And it does make me chuckle a little bit when I see that it talks about this loving\u2014all-knowing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N204732\">loving God who just is there and loves you unconditionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20474\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20475\">So, it\u2019s just funny when I\u2019ve been reading the prayer book that now I have my knowledge of REBT and I want to continue to put those things in action for\u2014to have a better life, to have a happier life, and to feel more at ease and to have better relationships and enjoy people and myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20476\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20477\">And I think just reading more\u2014I\u2019m speaking about future. Just reading as much as I can to have as much knowledge, because sometimes I read and then I forget, like we all do. I go back to the book that you had given me at the start of therapy. And one of my future goals, once I\u2019ll be a little more settled <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N204771\">in after my surgery and stuff, when I\u2019m sitting there and have more things\u2014more time on my hands and not working full-time is to be able to, now, after doing the 14 sessions, to look back at the REBT books and read them with a different mindset. To be like, \u201cOh, right,\u201d and have a little bit more\u2014even <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N204772\">more epiphanies, because I feel like those can keep happening as I read more.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P21-N20476-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"20\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20476-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":22,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"22\" data-page=\"22\">\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20478\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20479\">So, to be able to give myself that gift to look\u2014to read but with a different frame of mind, frame of reference. So, reading, yeah. Reading, reading. And then doing journaling. Knowing that it\u2019ll be difficult for me to write for the first couple weeks, so with that, I can record. There\u2019s other ways for <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N204791\">me to\u2014I\u2019ll find a way. If I really want to do it and I really want to keep at it, there\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t have to restrict myself to just writing or typing or anything like that. But there\u2019s got to be other\u2014I won\u2019t have a tape recorder like \u201cLong Island Medium\u201d [laughs] but I can\u2014no, she uses her recorder. <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N204792\">I watch \u201cLong Island Medium\u201d but anyway. So, that there are other ways that I can do it if I really want to. And that it\u2019s a gift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2047A\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2047B\">THERAPIST: Do you really want to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2047C\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2047D\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2047E\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2047F\">THERAPIST: Good, then you will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20480\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20481\">CLIENT: Oh, and one last thing is to look back at my journal from the very, very beginning sessions, when I was having such\u2014just to realize how far I\u2019ve come and that I can continue to\u2014that I can always\u2014there\u2019s always room for growth, that\u2019s . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20482\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20483\">THERAPIST: If you\u2019re alive and kicking, there usually is. You mentioned, a few minutes ago, reading about the unconditional love of God and how that nourishes you. And I just want to add, even though there was perhaps an implication, but it may be a really healthy part of your stated intentions to continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N204831\">to work on having\u2014giving that unconditional love and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20484\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20485\">CLIENT: To myself, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20486\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20487\">THERAPIST: giving unconditional self-acceptance to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20488\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20489\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2048A\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2048B\">THERAPIST: Not only in your belief system of God giving it to you \u2013 not instead of , but in addition to giving that to yourself. Excellent, very good. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2048C\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2048D\">Okay, so, what I\u2019d like to give you now are these pages, as I said at the beginning, that my husband wrote and then we revised them: How to Maintain and Enhance Your REBT Gains. And you know, interestingly \u2013 and again, to your credit \u2013 a number of things you have said you intend to do are what we recommend <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N2048D1\">here. And so, I\u2019m leaving this with you and this is one of the things you can read and reread and reread, especially if there\u2019s any degree of relapse or you\u2019re self-torturing. [chuckles] Reminding you, and this reminds you that with anything \u2013 including REBT \u2013 to maintain gains takes ongoing work and <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N2048D2\">practice, work and practice, work and practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N2048E\"><span data-id=\"P22-N2048F\">CLIENT: [sighs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N20490\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20491\">THERAPIST: All right, so, first of all, it is important to accept that it is human nature to \u2013 at times plateau, seem to stop progress, sometimes to backslide. So, it is helpful, and important, to accept that possibility \u2013 not that certainty \u2013 and then these words you can read give you steps of how <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N204911\">to maintain your improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P22-N20490-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"21\"><span data-id=\"P22-N20490-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":23,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561808\" data-realpage=\"23\" data-page=\"23\">\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20492\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20493\">First of all, when you find any falling back, pinpoint precisely thoughts, feelings, and irrational beliefs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20494\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20495\">And then secondly, to keep thinking rational beliefs consciously and intentionally, and repeating coping statements such as: \u201cI don\u2019t need my mother\u2019s approval, even though I\u2019d like it.\u201d \u201cI can stand what I don\u2019t like, I just don\u2019t like it.\u201d And make those rational thoughts \u2013 even when there isn\u2019t some <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N204951\">adverse circumstance \u2013 part of your mental conversation with yourself or to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20496\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20497\">Keep looking for and discovering and disputing and challenging the irrational beliefs, and forcefully and persistently disputing them. Keep risking \u2013 in a healthy way, no unhealthy risks \u2013 but risking doing some of the things you fear irrationally in order to prove to yourself that those ideas were <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N204971\">irrational and totally without foundation. Just like my husband was afraid of talking to women, and yet pushed himself to do \u2013 uncomfortably \u2013 what he wanted to get comfortable at doing. And he pushed himself and believe me, he got comfortable with talking to women [chuckles], so that\u2019s what that\u2019s about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20498\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20499\">Now, try to see clearly on a daily basis, if possible, the difference between the healthy negative emotions and the unhealthy ones.

Clearly seeing the difference between\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N2049E\"><span data-id=\"P23-N2049F\">CLIENT: And I have memories, too. That\u2019s another thing that I think is important to acknowledge is that we\u2019re given that gift that when I\u2019m in a moment, I can think back to one of our sessions and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N204A0\"><span data-id=\"P23-N204A1\">THERAPIST: remember what was helpful<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N204A2\"><span data-id=\"P23-N204A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N204A4\"><span data-id=\"P23-N204A5\">THERAPIST: in our session.

Remember the main insights of REBT, I\u2019m not going to read them you, they\u2019re all here in these notes. When you can \u2013 if possible \u2013 be with healthy-thinking people.

In an earlier session, you talked about one of your friends who acts like a drama queen and he was catastrophizing and you bought it. You bought the nonsense <\/span><span data-id=\"P24-N204D11\">he was saying until we discussed it. So, I\u2019m not saying get him out of your life because he catastrophizes, there are other qualities he has which you enjoy, but I am recommending that you don\u2019t absorb his unhelpful ideas. And, in time, maybe you\u2019ll be helping him with your healthier thinking and ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N204D2\"><span data-id=\"P24-N204D3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N204D4\"><span data-id=\"P24-N204D5\">THERAPIST: And here, it\u2019s written, you practice using REBT with some of your friends and relatives when you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N204D6\"><span data-id=\"P24-N204D7\">So, then you see here, there\u2019s a whole section here how to deal with backsliding.

But not impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N204F8\"><span data-id=\"P24-N204F9\">CLIENT: It is important to not get complacent, but if you don\u2019t practice it each day\u2014to not take it as failure and say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not successful at REBT because I have one day that\u2014\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N204FA\"><span data-id=\"P24-N204FB\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N204FC\"><span data-id=\"P24-N204FD\">CLIENT: like last week, when I catastrophized about my friends not being able to be here.
