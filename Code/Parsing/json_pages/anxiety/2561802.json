So I\u2019d like to start our session by prefacing that I would like a strong part of our focus tonight to be on focus. We said in our last session that we would begin by looking at the homework that you did or didn\u2019t do. There were 2 homework assignments set. We will look at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">them soon, however, if you are comfortable with it, I\u2019d like to start tonight\u2019s session with a kind of relaxation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I\u2019d be happy to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: The goal of which is to clear out some of the chatter or the mental remnants of the busy day you\u2019ve just had, to help enable you to focus more stringently on what we\u2019re doing. Feedback I\u2019d like to offer you now, that might be surprising to you, tell me if it is, is that being the very bright, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">active, energetic woman that you are, with a lot going on in your life, you have a tendency to think a lot, to think fast, and to talk fast. In some of our conversations, one in particular, was during our last session, there were times when I would ask a question and you would start by answering it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">and then go off into this stream of a topic and that stream and that stream. Some of the times, I would eventually get us back to answering the original question! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: At other times, and part of my therapist role is to make the following assessment, I felt where you went was worthwhile exploring, so certainly, in our sessions, and in all of my work, it serves me well and it serves who I\u2019m working with well, to really focus. Then make a choice about what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">to do. So, with you, as I\u2019ve paid attention, I have observed the way you can start answering my question, addressing an issue, and then it\u2019s here and there and around there. So one of the things I would like us to do our best to practice tonight is \u2013 focus following the relaxation. That is my intention <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">for the session, which may change some as time goes on, we will see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So are you asking if I have a problem with that or if I think that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Not yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: The relaxation and then addressing your 2 homeworks and what you did and didn\u2019t do, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: And focusing on them, very particularly, and seeing how we go in completing our investigation, addressing those 2 areas. Then, in whatever time we have left, if we have time left, we shall see the good thing to do at that time. How does that sound to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It sounds wonderful. I think, you know, agree that I think my brain  tendency is that it is overactive, like an overactive bladder\u2014no I\u2019m joking. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: (joking) That must \u201cpiss\u201d you off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: (laughing) It does. That\u2019s good, and I think we had talked about at one point is that where it affects me is when there is no distraction and there\u2019s nothing really\u2014no TV and no phone, and no book to read, and I\u2019m just sort of lying as I\u2019m getting ready to drift off in the evening hours. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">that\u2019s when it comes sort of to light, in terms of how much anxiety I tend to create in this little brain. So I think that, if you\u2019re offering that focus, I am more than happy to accept. One thing before, though, we do start that, one little realization that I had is I  think, I think that it\u2019s very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">hard for me to assess whether the thought\u2014I think we\u2019ve had this conversation many times actually, and I continue to bring it up and pound it in\u2014but I think what\u2019s confusing for me is, does the body chemistry sort of get set off and then the thoughts go with the fact that the body chemistry is getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D3\">set off or vice versa? I\u2019m willing to bet, that it\u2019s the thoughts because the body has a body of its own. In other words, the heart pumps (inaudible) so my imagination would be that it\u2019s the thoughts, but the reason it\u2019s hard for me to see that is because, sometimes, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m thinking anything? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D4\">And then I\u2019m still having that nervous, panicky feeling. Am I making sense with that? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561802\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: To briefly answer your question, really our thoughts, our feelings, the visceral reactions, (crosstalk) the biology are connected and influence one another. They are very much intertwined. I just want to point out to you that I started off by saying our focus will be focus! So let us now <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">start with the relaxation and then (client laughing), and then look at your homework, (client laughing) and your active mind still brought up that question !!!so I hope you are seeing my facial expression and you\u2019re hearing my voice, indicating that I\u2019m not being critical. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: (laughing) Is this avoidance? I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s not over-analyze.

(laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Okay. So my original question was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: \u2026 are you comfortable with the idea of a relaxation and then focus \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: \u2026on the 2 homeworks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Okay (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: \u2026 and then we\u2019ll see whatever else happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: So let me point out to you that if you had taken that in and possibly not had other thoughts and ideas going on\u2014by the way, join the human race, that is our easy tendency to let our minds meander when we are not being disciplined\u2014but we\u2019re working together to help you learn how to use your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">mind in a healthy way. You can really choose what works for you and it doesn\u2019t mean we need to come to our easy, succumb rather, to our easy tendencies (crosstalk). So if you focus, listen well and retain that\u2014you see when you allow yourself to think of lots of thoughts, it\u2019s harder to retain the original one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yes it is. No wonder I never thought I had a good memory. (short pause) I\u2019m being serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Okay, but let\u2019s not go there now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: (laughing) I knew you were going to say that. Okay, let\u2019s not, let\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: All right so that\u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m feeling, I\u2019m creating a little bit of anxiety to answer your  question about the relaxation because I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do. Oh well, okay. That\u2019s what it is. I don\u2019t know what that is, so (laughing) I don\u2019t know why it makes me a little\u2014I don\u2019t want to say it makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">me nervous or I\u2019m making\u2014I know I\u2019m making myself nervous because I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do.

(laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: My hypothesis is you\u2019re making yourself nervous because you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do and you may have a belief which you add to that: \u201cit may be too hard, too much, I may fail at it and that would be awful.\u201d I would think that kind of flavor of thinking would make you nervous, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">now, how about we just do it \u2013 the relaxation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Okay.

My challenge to you is to stick with a particular, one at a time issue that we are going to look at and, specifically we\u2019re  starting with looking at the two homeworks. So we\u2019re going to stick with one and pretty much stay within that parameter, unless <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">there is a very beneficial reason not to. Are you with me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Reminding you the focus of tonight is partly practicing focus, okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Flow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: Focus. Okay, focus is a much more determined conscious application of your attention and thinking than flow, which actually doesn\u2019t necessarily involve conscious focus discipline.

I really didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s stick to looking at your homework and perhaps in the future we can talk about flow versus focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: Okay. (quiet laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: So what were your two homeworks.

So, yes if you\u2019ve thought of other ways such as (laughing) and relaxing (client laughing) \u2013 fine, but specifically there was the invitation to find some self-soothing thoughts, comments, words you could tell yourself if\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: All right, so the first one was the effective new philosophy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: The way I did it was, it was sort of\u2014the effective new philosophy is I didn\u2019t do it with the old homework. I did it with the self-soothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: That is interesting that you modified the homework\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: The homework that you gave me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Why? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: Because when I did the actual homework, I didn\u2019t have the old stuff with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: And did it occur to you do it later when you had the old stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah, it did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m noticing, again, now boldly giving you feedback here that<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: No I know what your feedback\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: That, at times\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t do what you ask\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t do the homework.

(Client laughing) So what do you think is behind that and let us be maintaining focus. We are looking at your first homework which you modified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: Because I felt\u2014I was concerned that, well I guess for the purpose of the  therapy, I knew what you had asked me was very clear with the self-soothing, but effective new philosophies, I still don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m good at those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">THERAPIST: Which was the reason for us selecting that homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">CLIENT: So I sort of, yeah\u2014(clears throat) how do I say this? I think it\u2019s becoming easier. Each piece, piece by piece, is becoming easier and easier or more natural for me to do.

However when you haven\u2019t been doing that habitually in your life so far, there\u2019s the danger of you, just by thinking in that way, using that word, of your having a too harsh, possibly perfectionistic <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201631\">expectation of yourself. Setting yourself up for a fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: I\u2019m aware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good start.

The setting myself up to fail before I even just go full throttle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: And when you steer away from trying to make the effort, from making the effort, you can prevent yourself from seeing how wise you can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: I know, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Then you continue to reach out and, and want your parents\u2019 approval, and want to get your girlfriend\u2019s support, and then you deprive yourself of assessing your efforts on your own. And enjoying the fruits of doing so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: And you miss out experiencing how strong you can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Which you have witnessed in yourself in the past when you were there for others, but you\u2019re not allowing yourself to develop the muscle of doing that now with your thinking. Diligently you go to work out at the gym, Jessa. Even when your shoulder and neck are pulsing in agony, you go to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F1\">gym, and you build up some of your other healthier muscles and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: Because I know I\u2019m good at that; that\u2019s what it is.

Only because you\u2019ve been doing it a long time. Same with this, with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B1\">exercising healthy thinking and focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not giving yourself the chance to see how successful you can be.

But it\u2019s interesting that I think back to sort of where that whole thing began. When I was a young girl, it sort of  started where I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201951\">had very intelligent, sort of, controlling-type of parental figures and, from a very young age, I never did any of my work\u2014this is definitely I hope not getting out there. So when I say really never did any of my work\u2014for an example, I would get a project to make a diorama was what I specifically remembered <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201952\">and I was about maybe 7 or 8, and I brought the diorama to school to obviously bring it in for a grade, and I remember being so proud because it was the most beautiful diorama, but I didn\u2019t do it. My father did. And then the same thing would continue with different projects. My college essay, I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201953\">here, can you look it over. The whole essay changed and became something different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not saying, let\u2019s continue to stay there. What I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019ve sort of yearned to have those feelings of self-efficacy and to know that I am a very bright,  intelligent woman who can do things on my own. But I think, when I think back sort of to how did that all sort of come to be, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201991\">of being so, umm so afraid to take a risk or to do something; I think it was because I did say \u201cMom, Dad\u201d \u2013 wanting help and then it was done and then it was done their way, not my way and there was a lot of criticism all mixed in one. So, without going back and blaming \u2026 without blaming, saying I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201992\">want to be able to\u2014I recognize that is where that came from and I recognize it more now than just recognizing. I\u2019m putting sort of the pieces together a little bit that, you know? That I might not have had that experience when I was a young child, but that I can have it now. I think that\u2019s where I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201993\">to rely on myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">THERAPIST: You can if you let yourself, which brings us back to the homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s harder, it\u2019s harder I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: You use that word a lot in some of our sessions (client moaning). So it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean it is TOO hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Well if you convince yourself it\u2019s too hard, then you\u2019ll restrict yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: This is a lot of new territory though. I mean, I say that every time, but it\u2019s only been\u2014I say it every time because it\u2019s still new. Do you understand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right, so given that it\u2019s new, I wonder if you\u2019d give yourself a break and be willing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: I am training\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: \u2026to imperfectly do your homework instead of modifying it so that in your own mind you don\u2019t do it wrongly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Do you hear what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Which is, like right now, we\u2019re exploring the homework realm and the fact that you modified it (client laughing) and seeing what you told yourself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: That I wouldn\u2019t, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: \u2026that led to your doing that. So it\u2019s all very informative and interesting, the more aware you are of what you do and whether it helps you or sabotages healthy goals. In your case, the area you\u2019ve just touched on, is knowing within yourself, your efficacy and potential and smartness much <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB1\">more than you let yourself have a chance to know.

Now you also did your version of homework, so I\u2019d like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF1\">to hear that now. (Client laughing) and then we\u2019ll look at the second homework which was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">CLIENT: There was the self-soothe and then there was the effective new philosophy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Aren\u2019t we talking about the effective new philosophies now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">CLIENT: No, no.

That you didn\u2019t do exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">CLIENT: Well I did the self-soothing, but what I was attempting to say was that I kind of felt they blended, the self-soothing and the effective new philosophies. I really didn\u2019t know the difference. Because I knew that what I was writing were self-soothing philosophies, but I thought that they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C91\">also effective. I didn\u2019t do the effective new philosophies for the old\u2014wasn\u2019t that what you had wanted, had asked?

(Client sighs) You know it\u2019s part of having tools there at the ready in case that happens again, if that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E31\">happens again. It helps you to have some soothing statements at the ready that you can repeat. That was the purpose of my suggesting that.

Instead of assuming that it will set in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20221\">CLIENT: Yes. That way of putting it is empowering, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20223\">THERAPIST: Because it is reminding you, you created the panic.

This is an empowering approach when you apply it, and it doesn\u2019t let you get away with not taking responsibility.

So my hypothesis is that you were doing the homework, to do the homework, rather than fully being immersed in it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2027F1\">feeling its results. Would that be right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20281\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s not.

It just takes\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20287\">THERAPIST: The more effort you make, the more you maintain and retain, and the better it can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20289\">CLIENT: I just think it\u2019s\u2014I used an example last time where, you know, you study, study, study for a test and you think you don\u2019t know anything and then you go to take the test and you actually get an A and that\u2019s what I felt when I was reading it just now. Wait a minute, I do know more about this than <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202891\">I gave myself credit for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028B\">THERAPIST: Which was my point earlier on when we were talking about you modifying the homework because you don\u2019t feel you\u2019ve really got it yet. The\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028D\">CLIENT: The effective new techniques that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2028F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20291\">CLIENT: I do still need maybe a little work with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20293\">THERAPIST: And so by not trying at all, you don\u2019t even know how much you do or don\u2019t have ability or facility with that part of the ABC process. So the homework I want to give you\u2014we\u2019re not quite finishing up yet, but in the light of what you\u2019ve shared, the homework that I want to give you, and tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202931\">me if you think that it\u2019s something you will do, is \u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20295\">CLIENT: (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20297\">THERAPIST: You have 2 REBT books. You\u2019ve got the one authored by me and Al (Albert Ellis), you\u2019ve got \u201cRational Emotive Behavior Therapy\u201d, and you\u2019ve got the book Al wrote which I did much of the research for, \u201cThe Myth of Self-Esteem\u201d. CLIENT: (sneeze) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20299\">THERAPIST: Each one, if you look in the index, has a section on the ABCDE method. So my suggestion to you for the coming week\u2019s homework is to read, the sections in both books, slowly and thoroughly. We are not going to meet again for our next session until next week, so you\u2019ve got a few days and nights. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202991\">You\u2019ve already probably read them quickly from what you once told me, or read parts of them, but since you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re not comfortable yet with the E, it\u2019s not\u2014what\u2019s the expression? \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029B\">CLIENT: Rocket science?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You can come to see that it is not complicated. You know if you understand ABC, there\u2019s nothing all that more complicated with E stage. And yet, for you, there is something that you\u2019ve not been comfortable with. So I\u2019m suggesting, asking, are you willing to take your time to read those <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2029D1\">2 books, at least those sections on the A B C D E method, which are not long\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029F\">CLIENT: On this specifically, on the effective new\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A1\">THERAPIST: On the whole ABCDE, because the E effective new philosophies follow the disputing, which follows the detective work, finding the irrational ideas. Doing at least one thorough ABCDE. Being willing to not to do it perfectly, but well enough. Being willing to have a giggling fit or a crying <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202A11\">fit when it comes to E and baking a cake instead for a distraction (client giggling) but see how you go persisting. That is the homework between now and next time, read and let yourself substantially take it in. Read it. Read it. Don\u2019t do your ABCDE until the next day, after reading it. Read it again. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202A12\">Let it sink in and then do it and see how you go. And if there are real stumbling blocks, we will look at them the next time.

What I actually did \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202CB\">THERAPIST: You have enough real stuff for us to work on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202CD\">CLIENT: (small giggle) Okay, so, this was. I\u2019ll just pick any\u2014okay. \u201cIf I make a mistake\u2026\u201d No I don\u2019t want that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202CF\">THERAPIST: Wait, wait, wait. Focus Jessa. Start with A an activating event. How about something very fresh, did something happen today that resulted in an emotion that was not healthy? Or was today a particularly good day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D1\">CLIENT: It was a wonderful day. Today was a wonderful day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D3\">THERAPIST: Oh! Good. I thought however that you said you woke up at 3 in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D5\">CLIENT: Last night? No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D7\">THERAPIST: A couple of nights ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202DB\">THERAPIST: And did not go to sleep and take the day off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202DD\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202DF\">THERAPIST: And you told me that you were feeling extreme anxiety?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E3\">THERAPIST: How about we look at that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E5\">CLIENT: No, I was very happy today. Be happy to look\u2014Oh I see what you\u2019re saying, how do we look at when that happened. Oh yeah\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E7\">THERAPIST: Do the ABCDE on that situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202E9\">CLIENT: Okay, okay, okay. Oh (sigh) geez there were so many things that I was creating at that moment, I mean a lot of anxiety. Okay so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202EB\">THERAPIST: Wait, wait, wait. Focus. At what moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202ED\">CLIENT: You wanted to use that as an example just now, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202EF\">THERAPIST: So right now, you\u2019re telling yourself there were so many things. The beauty of the ABCDE procedure is it gives you a chance to use specific neat categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N202EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N202EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561802\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202F1\">CLIENT: I see. So the activating events\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202F3\">THERAPIST: Systematic isn\u2019t it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202F5\">CLIENT: Structured. I see, yeah, yeah. I need, I meanI would like structure. I\u2019m not going to watch my\u2014structure is very helpful. So the A, the activating event, was that I was attempting to go to sleep in the evening before work the next day, and I started to think and over-think and over-think and <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202F51\">over-think about all of, number one, the options that I have right now in regards to getting surgery, not getting surgery. And then I took that, that little portion of what is up to me right at this moment and then went with, \u201cand if I do this, what if I make a mistake and if I do that would be a catastrophe <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202F52\">and if I decide to go with surgery and then everybody has to help out or people have \u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202F7\">THERAPIST: Wait, wait, wait. The activating event consisted of those thoughts? So in the ABCDE process, the next step is to clarify, the C, the consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202F9\">CLIENT: Well the consequences the anxiety, the panic and all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202FB\">THERAPIST: Okay, and now you go to the B \u2013 the irrational beliefs, which you were just starting to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202FD\">CLIENT: Right, so the irrational beliefs were if I have the surgery and it doesn\u2019t work and I\u2019m not feeling well afterwards, that is the worst thing? I can\u2019t live with that. That I made a mistake. I would have regrets. Lots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202FF\">THERAPIST: This is the stage in the process to take time to really clarify. Now when you say, for example, you know if you don\u2019t take time to do this, you\u2019ll do what you just did which is assume, you know if I make a mistake, I\u2019ll regret it. That\u2019s not irrational. That\u2019s quite rational, but what would <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202FF1\">make it irrational\u2026would be your adding should and awfulizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20301\">CLIENT: No I said it, then that would be the worst thing, that I couldn\u2019t live with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20303\">THERAPIST: You said that in relation to another thought. This is the beauty of writing it down Jessa. Then you see it and then you can find more easily any errors, you know, tack on the \u201cshould\u201d as appropriate and notice awfulizing. You see?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20305\">CLIENT: Yes. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20307\">THERAPIST: So there was your describing the issue of the right choice or not making the right decision, that would be awful, and as you \u201cshould\u201d make the right choice, and any other irrational beliefs and think. Form them into statements that make it clear they\u2019re irrational. The shoulds, the musts, <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203071\">the oughts, the catastrophizing. Identify them clearly\u2013 then disputing follows more easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20309\">CLIEMT: If I\u2014no, well I guess the things I said to myself in terms of self-blame, that\u2019s rational as well. \u201cJessa (ph) it\u2019s your\u2014people\u2014It was all here. It was all on this paper. I mean I can say it now, but it was \u201cpeople will think I\u2019m irrational,\u201d not irrational, \u201cpeople will think I\u2019m impulsive <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203091\">if I just jump to surgery instead of waiting more time to see, or instead of trying another\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2030B\">THERAPIST: \u201cPeople will think I\u2019m impulsive\u201d that\u2019s not an irrational statement, what do you add to it that makes it irrational?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2030D\">CLIENT: I know. That\u2019s not irrational, exactly. \u201cAnd if other people think that, that\u2019s the worst thing and I can\u2019t live with what other people think about me in terms of how I proceeded with my surgery or not surgery.\u201d Next one \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m bright enough to know which doctor is the best for <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2030D1\">me.

So is it clear to you, the helpfulness of phrasing them in a truthful honest way that reveals the irrationality? In other words, making the should, the must, the \u2018it\u2019s awful\u2019, the self-damnation, calling yourself stupid <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2032F1\">instead of saying \u2013 \u201cI could make a stupid choice\u201d...

They\u2019re not stupid. They did an act that was Studpid. Ad does that not apply to you? So, look at phraseology, words, and semantics. All right, so now comes the D.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20335\">CLIENT: The D, the D, ABCD. I\u2019m sorry, the disputing.

Even though I am basing my intelligence on making a decision that\u2019s something that\u2019s very\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20357\">THERAPIST: Basing my intelligence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20359\">CLIENT: Basing my intelligence on \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2035B\">THERAPIST: My assessment of my intelligence\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2035D\">CLIENT: My assessment of my intelligence on something that is new territory, that\u2019s\u2014wait, even, hold on. You know what\u2019s funny, when you do these, I never realized how much I give myself a hard time, even when I\u2019m just sitting here trying to do them with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2035F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s important that you realize it, so you stop it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20361\">CLIENT: I know. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t think clear\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20363\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s easier to write it down.

It is easier to write it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20367\">THERAPIST: Okay, so in the last one, essentially are you not basing your worth on your ability to make intelligent decisions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20369\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2036B\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s what you want to break down, dispute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2036D\">CLIENT: Okay, so it\u2019s possible to make stupid choices and it\u2019s possible to not have the highest\u2014I don\u2019t want to say the highest, it\u2019s possible to not have, (laughingly) sometimes even possibly not utilize my intelligence in a certain situation, but that doesn\u2019t change the value of me ultimately. I am <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N2036D1\">a human being with worth despite my possible ridiculous choices and possibly not as intellectually superb as I\u2019d like them to be, or not like them to be, but as they could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2036F\">THERAPIST: Your abilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20371\">CLIENT: My abilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20373\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really important for you to get. You know some of the things, when doing REBT, we can come up with these appropriate disputes and effective new philosophies, and it\u2019s a good start, but initially we may only believe the new effective philosophies lightly or mainly intellectually.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P17-N20372-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"16\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20372-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":18,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561802\" data-realpage=\"18\" data-page=\"18\">\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20375\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20377\">THERAPIST: And then some people will unfortunately give up because they don\u2019t feel the conviction, not realizing the helpfulness of patience and persistence and that conviction can come with ongoing effort, in all probability, if one doesn\u2019t give up too soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20379\">CLIENT: I was thinking that last night because I was actually having a difficult time at first, drifting off to sleep, and I kept reminding myself of what we had spoken about earlier, which is, don\u2019t give up on yourself. I did, and I kept saying that, and that actually helped. I said, \u201cDo not give up\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203791\">because I don\u2019t think I realized that just giving in to that panic and anxiety is a form of giving up on yourself and I wasn\u2019t putting that really together, but once you had phrased it in that way. I said, \u201cYou know what, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing and I refuse.\u201d But then that all comes together <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203792\">with how much you do give yourself worth because if you feel that you\u2019re worth it, or if you think that you have that worth and then act on it, then you don\u2019t give up. So, it\u2019s all\u2014that\u2019s what I felt like. I felt like I\u2019m worthy enough to say \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up at this point\u201d from a lot of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203793\">work that we\u2019ve been doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2037B\">THERAPIST: Did you do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2037D\">CLIENT: No I fell asleep and I had a\u2014I ended up doing some type of meditation thing and I said, \u201cOh, here we go\u201d and created anxiety about the anxiety. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to sleep the night before, this is what happened,\u201d you know and started doing that, I said \u201cWhat is this crap?\u201d I actually had that little <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N2037D1\">internally. I did have your voice in my head and I said, \u201cThis is crap.\u201d I said, \u201cThis is really crap, Jessa, that you\u2019re doing right now.\u201d I said this is like, it\u2019s like a child that gets a punishment. I said \u201cBut you\u2019re not a child, you\u2019re an adult and you need to go to sleep and that\u2019s what is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N2037D2\">to help you right now.\u201d I was really having that dialogue instead of just letting the other irrational stuff sort of take over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2037F\">THERAPIST: You mean letting it go unchallenged?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20381\">CLIENT: So I enjoyed that last night because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really had a challenge where I would be able to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20383\">THERAPIST: I will mention here, because as you know, some of our sessions are being transcribed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20385\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20387\">THERAPIST: And I will mention, the day after our last session we had a 5-minute conversation. You called me and I was luckily available to pick up at that time, and you shared with me the fact that you had not gone to school that day because, the night before, you hadn\u2019t slept sufficiently and you felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203871\">such anxiety and panic, and felt you couldn\u2019t go to school. So one of the things I reminded you, or pointed out to you, which you agreed with, was that you gave up too soon, the possibility of calming yourself down. You went with the drama of, \u201cOh I\u2019m not asleep and it\u2019ll be awful,\u201d and we spoke then <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203872\">and I shared with you then, or reminded you that you would not, if a student, client, child came to you crying, look at your watch and after 60 seconds say, \u201cShut up!\u201d (client laughing) You would keep on comforting them. You adore your cats. If one of your cats was in some pain, you wouldn\u2019t say, after <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203873\">120 seconds, \u201cShut up stupid cat!\u201d You\u2019d keep stroking it. Yet you\u2019ve not been so kind to yourself in the past. You haven\u2019t been so kind to yourself and that struck a chord with you, and then I think I said something and you laughed. Laughter seems to be a very good medicine for you and most of us to use at times.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P18-N20386-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"17\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20386-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":19,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561802\" data-realpage=\"19\" data-page=\"19\">\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20389\">CLIENT: Yes. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2038B\">THERAPIST: It helps us have a healthy perspective also. Well in just 5 minutes, it seemed your emotion changed 180 degrees because you lightened up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2038D\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2038F\">THERAPIST: And, oh yes, then you created new anxiety that you were going to be fired for yet another sick day. You thought that you were going to lose your job and then I think I proposed, well let\u2019s look for lawyers (client laughing) because if you get fired, (client laughing) that would not be sufficient <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2038F1\">grounds for being dismissed. I offered to come and cheer you on in the courtroom (client laughing) and we had a little laugh about that and again you felt a whole lot differently because you thought about it differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20391\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20393\">THERAPIST: All right, our time is running out for tonight\u2019s session, so let\u2019s come back to the ABCDE. The situation we were looking at, you have identified some of the irrational beliefs. We are doing this off the top of your head. You\u2019re not writing it down. You\u2019ve done a little bit of disputing. So, <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N203931\">your favorite part may be effective new philosophy or philosophies that come on the heels of your disputing. You do your best to do some imperfect E\u2019s now, imperfect, meaning not perfect, meaning not pressured. Making a good effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20395\">CLIENT: I can definitely try to do that, but the question I have before I start is I\u2019m having a hard time seeing the difference between the effective new philosophies and disputing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20397\">THERAPIST: Right, here\u2019s the difference. So, the irrational belief is toxic, and disputing is \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to accept this unchallenged!\u201d And you challenge it, and the effective new philosophy is not this kind of, you could call it, argumentative challenge to the toxic beliefs. It\u2019s more like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N203971\">\u201cI am a resilient human. I can\u2019t stand what I don\u2019t like.\u201d Affirming, realistic statements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20399\">CLIENT: Oh, I see, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2039B\">THERAPIST: \u201cIf I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019ll still survive and I may even do better than I thought I would\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2039D\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s cheering yourself on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2039F\">THERAPIST: It is. Other people might liken it to an affirmation. Use the language you prefer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P19-N203A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I kind of like, just, if that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m going to call it that, affirmations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P19-N203A3\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s put an E in front of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P19-N203A5\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll put an E in front of it, but for my own, that resonates for me, affirmation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P19-N203A7\">THERAPIST: All right, E\u2026affirmation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P19-N203A9\">CLIENT: Okay, I am a valuable person. I\u2019m a valuable human being and a woman of worth despite past mistakes I may have made and despite being a fallible human, I still have worth, irregardless, if that\u2019s word. Irregardless of some fallacies that we all have as just part of being a human being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P19-N203AB\">THERAPIST: Watch out for overgeneralizing ; \u201cwe all have..\u201d.

I think I probably would benefit from another one of the self-worth. Something along those lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203BF\">THERAPIST: Good to come up with as many as you can think of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203C1\">CLIENT: Just, how do I say it? Despite what I tell myself about who I am as a person, like just value and intelligence and qualities. Qualities about myself despite what I\u2019ve told myself in the past. I don\u2019t have to believe everything that I tell myself. I don\u2019t necessarily have to go with what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203C11\">telling myself. I can take a different path. I can take a different course. I can choose basically to not believe and I can encourage myself to not sort of fall into the trap of panic and anxiety, which any human is probably, given the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203C3\">THERAPIST: Stop comparing now. Keep it simple. You don\u2019t have to do a whole long monologue here. (client laughing) These are effective new philosophies, but you\u2019re on a good track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203C5\">CLIENT: Okay, if my life isn\u2019t\u2014what else do you want about my\u2014I\u2019m going to do one about my physical health right now. Despite my physical health not being, me not being in the best physical condition at this moment in time, there\u2019s always room for change and for growth and nothing set in stone. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203C51\">no permanency in terms of I can forge ahead despite my physical ailments and there\u2019s hope for the future that I will get better and that I won\u2019t stay stuck in a situation simply because it\u2019s been going on for X amount of times. I can continue to repeat how many months (laughingly) and how many years <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203C52\">I\u2019ve been in pain if I choose. But I can also decide to say, that might be the case, but things can get better and possibly will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203C7\">THERAPIST: Right, and I think it\u2019s valuable to put in the consideration of worst case scenario. Remember this is effective new philosophy. \u201cSo if things don\u2019t go as well I expect, I\u2019m a human with resilience. I can find other things to focus on if I will be restricted physically in any ways, and my <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203C71\">life can still have meaning and some joys.\u201d We can put those worst case scenarios in because, left unspoken, they can be like little haunting ghosts in your head, if you allow them to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203C9\">So you get the idea. Now what\u2019s really good to do after the ABCDE, and this will be very helpful when we\u2019re no longer having sessions, is for you to give yourself homework. Things to do as a result of the ABCDE, to help you enforce and reinforce the effective new awarenesses and philosophies. So it <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203C91\">may be as simple as writing down the E\u2019s and reading them before you go to sleep and when you wake up. Something like that. Giving yourself an activity, something to do to maintain and reinforce the gain. Make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P20-N203CD\">THERAPIST: All right, so now it is time for tonight to finish up.

(laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203E4\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203E5\">THERAPIST: To read, and was there something else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203E7\">CLIENT: Yeah to do the ABCDE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203E8\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203E9\">THERAPIST: To do at least one thoroughly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203EA\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203EC\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203ED\">THERAPIST: Okay, all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203EF\">CLIENT: I do have one question actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203F1\">THERAPIST: Has anyone died from lack of sleep? I think you asked earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203F3\">CLIENT: I forgot about that, but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203F5\">THERAPIST: I predict that when you die, it won\u2019t be from that cause. (client laughing) What\u2019s your question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203F7\">CLIENT: (laughing) Is there a description or word for when there\u2019s so many (laughing) thoughts all at once. I mean with this work, with REBT in general? So, is there (pause.) Is there sort of a way, a definition of what you can call it when the mind does the shoulds and then you don\u2019t even know sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N203F71\">what it is? That\u2019s there\u2019s so many thoughts that you can\u2019t even catch them and you don\u2019t know what they are, and not about having to be perfect. I\u2019m not talking about that or the shoulds or anything, but when there\u2019s so many and then you have to\u2014is that called focus?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203F9\">THERAPIST: Focus is forcing yourself to look at one thought or thing at a time. What you\u2019ve described could be simply put, having lots of thoughts and when you say not knowing what they are, one could suggest there are some subconscious attitudes, thoughts and beliefs. However, with awareness that the <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N203F91\">mind is being like a monkey jumping around here and there and all over the place one can choose to take some deep breaths, do a relaxation technique (that leads some humans called Jessa to laugh themselves to death)... (client laughing). Anyway to steady oneself and to just start writing them down <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N203F92\">and getting them out of the head and onto paper \u2013 ready to dispute and replace when helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203FA\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203FB\">CLIENT: Is that called attention deficit disorder though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203FC\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203FD\">THERAPIST: Jessa, we have to finish now. Bottom line, for you and your tendency to have many thoughts, it will be helpful to make time to stop and write them down and then look at them with a more objective eye, dispute and replace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N203FE\"><span data-id=\"P21-N203FF\">CLIENT: Got ya.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20400\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20401\">THERAPIST: From a more objective stance. Did I answer your question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20402\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20403\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no you did, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20404\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20405\">THERAPIST: All right. So you have some homework to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20406\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20407\">CLIENT: Yes I do, thanks for reminding me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20408\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20409\">THERAPIST: We will speak again next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2040A\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2040B\">CLIENT: Okay, excellent. Thank you Debbie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2040C\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2040D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
