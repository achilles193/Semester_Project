Hello Jessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I want to hear whatever you're wanting to tell me and also I'd like to know about the homework but before that, a few days ago we had a quickie emergency session didn't we?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yes we did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It lasted about thirty minutes or so. I was not able to record it at the time. Would you mind sharing what happened, how you felt, what we did, what you did and what happened afterward?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: And then we can talk about your homework and everything since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: So yes we did have a more impromptu session on Friday night. Basically what it related to was the fact that I think I mentioned in the past in some of the recordings that I just recently had surgery and in addition to having shoulder surgery and trying to recover from some very painful processes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">I was having other pain and numbness and tingling shooting down my arm, very concerning things happening, and what ended up happening was I received an MRI report on Friday that showed I had a herniated disc in my cervical spine, in my neck. To the say the least it's been, I'm taking steroids and doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">all these things and so I phoned you on Friday evening because a friend of mine when I was explaining what was going on and just sort of giving him the low down he proceeded to tell me that I was too young, he says I'm way too young to have a herniated disc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: He's a medical doctor? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (chuckles) No he's definitely not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: He's definitely not, that's a significant point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Definitely not. So he said I was too young and then proceeded to tell me about his boss and how his boss had a herniated disc and how he's had three steroid injections, that surgery is definitely the next step because he plays golf and he's active and he's not following the right plan and how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">I should definitely go and see his chiropractor and then he's saying a lot of different things. Then he told me he was going to go speak with this chiropractor to see if I could get in there, Dr. 'whatever his name is' for free because he told me he charged $75 and I said I didn't really want to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">spending that right now, I'll wait, thank you very much, I see my doctor on Tuesday. He then proceeded to call me back and share with me that, he said \"Would you like the good news first or the bad news?\" and I said of course the bad news and he said \"Well the bad news, it's permanent and you have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">wear a brace, a neck brace for two years.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Your friend, the non-doctor told you this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: My friend, the non-doctor shared this. So I allowed myself to get into a state of hysteria because for whatever reason, we don't have to get into that I guess but I felt very desperate...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I think it would be good for you to identify what contributed to your feeling hysterical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Well I think I tend to listen to people that I think are very smart and I look at them...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Listen, or listen and believe? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Both listen and believe what they say and if they say something that sounds, like if they're a very highly intelligent person, even when they're not highly intelligent, if they say it with conviction it's like I sometimes tend to just feel like it's the word of God. Like if you are saying this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">then it must be the case. It's very extreme, it's very exaggerated and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2547687\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Jessa I have a fantastic bridge I can sell you. It's called the Brooklyn Bridge and I can sell it to you at a great price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh, you want to buy it? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: No thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well done. (chuckles) I'm glad you're not a hundred percent gullible...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: No I'm not. I make my own decisions, I have my own discretion, but I think that when I'm feeling desperate I think it's more that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: When you're making yourself desperate by telling yourself what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: That I'm never going to be the same again and very many should's and musts and all those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Do you tell yourself: I must find the answer, I must find the solution?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I'm very very frustrated at this point because the pain is just debilitating. I've been feeling it since April and I was sick last year for a period of three months and when I just started to get better from being really, really ill and I wasn't able to walk and was so down I felt like I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">a good number of months but it was still teetering on like any moment, you know, there was still fear of course, I was traumatized by what had occurred, or I'll say it REBT way I traumatized myself by what happened but regardless of that it was a very huge, pivotal point in my life, and then when <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">I got better and actually met, had like a girlfriend and everything, pretty much three months later all of this started to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: The physical symptoms?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: The physical symptoms of my arm and stuff like that. A few years back before I even got sick I was in physical therapy for three years because I wasn't able to walk and started having some really bad back stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mmm, yes, but now let us get back to look at your feelings of hysteria on Friday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah I get like this I'm sure despite all my issues, I don't want to blame what's happened in my life. In other words all these issues I was the way I was before if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: No, can you clarify?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes I've always been somebody who's very hard on myself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Until now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Oh really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, can you predict the future?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: No. Fine, so yeah until now. Yes it would be wonderful if I could change, I mean, if anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: No, wait. Have we not already seen some changes for the better in your attitude to yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Maybe a little bit but I feel like I'm extremely, I feel like I'm still sort of up and down with these things because it takes (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: That's right, you're human.  Just to remind you there have been times recently I've acknowledged your good effort and you've thanked me. But in the first week we had a session you seemed to really not be able to let yourself take in positive feedback, and then in later weeks you did So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">I certainly have observed changes. There is evidence that your positive change is possible. You and I have agreed that you're getting better at catching your should's, your language is changing, you're speaking in language that indicates you're taking responsibility for your emotion rather than blaming <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">the circumstances for example when you say \"I 'make myself' hysterical,\" so there IS progress. Now back to Friday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2547687\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes, so then you spoke to me, and I have to say thank you for that because it definitely helped in the moment when I was in this sort of state of mass hysteria, it definitely, I felt calmed after our talk and everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Share now what it was that allowed you to change your desperation to calmness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Because you used humor, you were able to show me that it wasn't, that my friend who maybe didn't make the best choices and didn't really even think of me before he spoke, wasn't the word of truth or God and that whatever he shared with me was not...number one wasn't even accurate and number <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">two is in the scheme of everything that's going on it's almost, you can look at the ridiculousness of the way that he was speaking to me that he was...Oh because he did say at one point \"I'm educated,\" I said \"How do you know all this about herniated discs?\" and he said \"Well I'm educated,\" and I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">like \"Oh so I'm not?\" like I don't know anything. So it was funny because thinking back when you made a couple comments about like is he the only, the doctor he was going to recommend, like is he the only doctor who can possibly help me? It definitely shed light on the fact that yeah, this is not the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200633\">only...I think I'm very much into putting things into a neat little box, which life is not like that and that there should be one answer and that one person is right and that they have all the answers, and I know deep down that that's not it but when I get into certain situations that tend to come up <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200634\">for me where I feel dependent upon what somebody says or doesn't say, so it's like taking that ownership that I can make decisions as well and even just now on the way coming back from work my father's already like \"How are you feeling? Are you going to see the neurologist?\" he's got similar back pain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200635\">and issues, and if I ever say to him like \"Dad maybe you should try, not should, but maybe look into getting like physical therapy...\" he would say \"I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!\"  It was interesting because he was sharing with me that this is what he thought I should do, \"You should go call your neurologist, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200636\">you should...\" and I said \"There's no point, I don't need to follow up with him and go back in. There's a new doctor I'm seeing on Tuesday\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Tomorrow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Tomorrow, yes. I explained that to him and he's like \"Okay,\" and I said \"You know how you get when you get frustrated? I'm not really ready to talk right now,\" because when he's in pain he'll say \"I'm cranky...\" so I basically shared that with him, that I just wasn't really feeling up to it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">and that I was having a cranky feeling type moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: So you were quite assertive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I guess I was. I didn't really think about it like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Okay, so I was? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Sounds like it to me. Reflect on what you just told me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Okay I guess I was. It feels foreign...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: In the past you have not found it all that easy to be assertive with your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: No I don't find it easy at all. That's like my hardest thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: And you just described to me that you were assertive with them moments ago without even indicating that it was a great achievement, in other words it sounds like you were just able to let yourself state your truth in an assertive way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2547687\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Oh, see I thought I was a bitch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) Oh well isn't that interesting notice your self-evaluation. Telling your father what you think and feel makes you a bitch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: That's my go to...my go to, I have to, I end up allowing myself to feel guilty when he's being caring and telling me what he thinks I should do and I don't go with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: From what you told me I didn't hear any bitch-like sentences. Were you leaving out a whole lot of verbal abuse that you showered on him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: No I was actually on the bus and I'm like \"I'm really cranky...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: So notice how easily you can be hard in evaluating yourself and surprise, surprise I shed the light on it right now so you can be more aware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) It was just so funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: So back to Friday night. So you made yourself hysterical by taking too seriously what your friend and we agreed on Friday night that you friend has drama queen tendencies, and a doctor he is not! and despite that, you took his words seriously and you built them out of all proportion in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">your mind and catastrophized and horriblized, and it was lucky when you called that I was available for that time for us to talk ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I'm very lucky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And we were able together to put things in perspective. You were able to laugh, you were able to make a practical plan and at least clarify that the practical plan you considered already was efficient, reminding yourself that tomorrow, Tuesday you are going to a doctor, a REAL doctor, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">you're going to speak to someone who has a medical degree...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: And we'll see what happens from there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: So when we finished our short session on Friday night you were considerably calmer and experiencing less emotional pain, and the goal we spoke about was to take it easy for the weekend. Today is Monday so how was your weekend? Did you watch your thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I did a little bit but I went to my friend, my close friend who lives in the building I live in, I went to her Halloween party and was there seeing a lot of friends that I hadn't seen in a while and I think I sort of had to put on a happy face I didn't have to, but I chose to put on like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">happy face and make it seem like I was feeling, I mean they saw clearly that I wasn't feeling well but I didn't have the neck brace on and I felt like maybe if I just act as if I'm feeling okay then it will come out that way. I felt like it took a lot of energy and a lot of effort so that when I came <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">home late Saturday, I was here with my girlfriend, I felt like I decompensated, was really getting upset and I feel like it's now starting to effect, I don't know what I should say here but I feel like it's...not 'should' but, I feel like it's affecting my relationship as well and just my feeling very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200973\">depressed and it's hard for me because it's a new relationship, it's hard for me to sort of weed out if it's the relationship or if it's me in the relationship. You can't blame one person for how a relationship goes but I feel that the roles have become almost that I, it's like \"Woe is me, I'm upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200974\">and I don't feel well,\" and my girlfriend then in turn comes to like \"It's going to be okay,\" and I feel it now starting to trickle into other aspects of my life to the point where I feel like there's a part of me that feels \"Jessa, would you be okay to not even be in a relationship right now because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200975\">it's still new?\" It's not like I'm married or in a significant relationship of 25 years, its brand new and so to me it's taking on, I feel that I'm allowing it to seep into a lot of other aspects.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2547687\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Allowing what to seep into other aspects? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: My upset and my disturbance over the pain and over the depression I guess, if that's what you want to call it of just feeling like every day is hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: So there are a few things that have just come up in what you said. There's the area of your girlfriend being in a nurturing role, but (and you didn't say what I'm about to say) , am I accurate in interpreting or inferring that you're not comfortable being in a role of more of a receiver in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">a sense? Am I wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: No, you're right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: So behind that is there, \"I should mostly be my bright, positive, cheerful self?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So it's not surprising if you're so hard on yourself and then not comfortably unconditionally accepting yourself, that it would be quite easy to find it difficult to receive unconditional acceptance from another when you're not being Ms. Perky, cheerful, happy, bright Jessa?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Exactly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: In your assessment? I haven't heard from you that she's complaining...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: No, she isn't complaining. She will tell me \"You know, if I'm ever in a situation you would do the same,\", that I would be there and I would...and then of course, again, my issue is that I then think \"I can't think about that right now. I just have to get better myself. I don't want to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">about you having an issue, that's like this, to this extent.\" (chuckles) \"I just want to think about the fact that you care and love me despite this and that it's not defining who I am or defining who we are, it's just a part of what's going on right now but that it doesn't have to be so hum drum,\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">but then I feel badly because I know she's being put out, I also know she has a choice in a sense that she doesn't have to stay in this relationship so I think it's a whole mixed bag of things but I think a lot of it does come from just me feeling I might be like that regardless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Might be like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Regardless of whether I had this, all this stuff going on right now because in past relationships when I didn't have this I did feel that I had to be bright, cheerful, happy, upbeat, otherwise...it was very extreme. It's like I'm either, can I relate it back to what I think maybe it comes from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: I think it does have to do a lot with the fact that I didn't, I felt my mother was very loving towards me when I was in a good mood and when I was down or upset she would push it right away and say \"You're complaining and I don't want to hear it,\" and when my mother used to say you're like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">doormat and so there was no empathy, really a whole lot, it would maybe last for like two or three minutes and I would get that empathy for two or three minutes like \"Oh, wow, you really do understand,\" and then it was just like \"You're going to be fine,\" like quickly let's just move on.  I don't have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B32\">time for this type of thing\". That was her attitude when I am good, she is nice, and when she disapproves ... I think I see that in me now but it's like I have to put on this sort of facade that everything's great because that's the only way I think I'm going to get...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2547687\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Rewarded?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Rewarded, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Well, now at your age?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Jessa You can continue to practice the attitude that your mother modeled for you or you can stop that crap.

In any case now you can continue to make effort and change what has felt so automatic until now because indeed it was modeled, you didn't question it, you took it on and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">so it became your attitude towards yourself, from what you told me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I didn't know there was anything wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: But now you do.
