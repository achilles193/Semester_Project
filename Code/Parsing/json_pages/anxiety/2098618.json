I had three closings yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Zoiks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. One of them I was having another attorney do. The first one I represented the seller who was turning around and buying a house downtown. They're selling here. I've been dealing with the daughter whose husband is a client of Jess's, a child support client who they still owe her money and whatnot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Were you representing them in both the sale and the buy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So they were taking all the proceeds from the sale and buying cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Which can't be any easier. A seller rep \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: A seller rep is easy and buying with cash is easy, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Like a week ago, I find out \u2014 like they tell us there's a title problem, so I agreed to fix that, but they hold back like $500 so that issue is resolved. Then I'm trying to get the information from my client to order the mortgage payoffs, and she delays and finally gets it to me. And they tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">me I've got to fax it in and it's a two-day turnaround.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">So I send her the sheet to sign for the authorization and she sends it right back to me, which I thought was a little odd because she has to get her parents to sign it. I fax it over at noon, basically on Wednesday, so two days would be at noon on Thursday \u2014 no, Tuesday I faxed it over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Forty-eight hours would be \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Noon yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: \u2014 noon yesterday, with the closing being at 11 yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Of course by the end of the day on Wednesday, no payoff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So I was kind of anxious all day about this whole thing, and of course it just got worse at night. I woke up in the morning, I'm up at like 5:30 and the bank doesn't open until eight. So I finally called them at eight and I'm on the phone with them. They put me on hold, they put me on hold, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">they come back. They can't send me the payoff because the authorization I sent, the signatures don't match the signatures that they have. So I'm like oh my God, she must have forged \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: She signed for them or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it turns out, because I saw them sign the deed, that they weren't forged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Just that the wife \u2014 they're an old couple and the wife has just improved her handwriting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: And the husband has \u2014 his name [is Karl] and he signed the authorization [Karl], so it looks different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">But I've got to get them to call and send the payoff, and luckily they called and sent me the payoff at like 8:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: So you had the couple who had signed and they hadn't matched it actually call into the bank or something, and that worked well enough to get you the payoff in a couple of hours [in advance of closing].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right, they just had to give all their information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Like I think the daughter did it. She may have authorization with the bank, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you had been \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: It worked out, but I had just been going nuts, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: And of course at the table they tell me that they left all this trash in the backyard. That they did the walk-through the night before and they figured the trash would be gone, so I had to break the news to them that there would still be trash there. So that was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098618\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: To the buyer? You had to break the news to the buyer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: To the buyer, yeah. And now I've got to go down there, just a five-minute closing and then come back and cash checks because I need checks in the account because my third closing, which another attorney was doing for me \u2014 Phil was doing \u2014 the sellers are bringing money to the closing because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">they didn't have enough in the sale price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">There was a short sale [that got the bank involved] and it's FHA which means if they don't get it by the first of the month, the payoff, it's an extra month's interest. Well the first of the month is Saturday, so they've got to get it today. And of course there's a problem with the husband bringing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">his money and unless my deposits from yesterday cleared today, I don't have enough money in my account to send the wire out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">I'm supposed to meet up with this guy at some point to get the money from him, hoping I can get the wire and get it out. So I'm like all anxious about getting the money from this guy. And I logged into my account this morning and all my deposits are gone. It's just showing as if they were never made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Whoa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: And luckily just as I came in here, I started having trouble accessing my account. So it's about 8:30 and the tech guys are probably getting in and are hopefully fixing this problem and that's what it is, just a problem. But it's just like I can't handle this one thing after another that just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">you know, they ultimately get resolved. You know, nothing major has been screwed up other than this guy not bringing his money to closing. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">It's just the waiting, you know, the time period. I mean, I first checked it last night at like 1:30 and I checked it again at 5:30 this morning and my deposits are gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, boy, you're really keyed up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, I'm like nauseous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: I'm leaving town tomorrow and I've got all these things I need to do today. I've got to play with Lucille because Lucille gets sad when I leave, but while I'm there she's all conflicted about playing with me. So Jess thinks I just need to spend more time with her. Of course, she wanted me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">do it yesterday but, you know, there was no time. I had to get all this stuff out. One of the things I was thinking is that I got to the bank too late, then my deposits were too late, you know, to account for the same day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">But hopefully that's not the case. Either way I've got \u2014 I don't know. It's fucked up. It's just fucked up. I'm going to have to beg.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Hmmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: I'm going to have to beg to get them to override \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: \u2014 if things don't fall into place like they're supposed to. If things fall into place like they're supposed to, it shouldn't be a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: And last time I logged in, I couldn't pull up my accounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: It's just got me \u2014 I mean, it's just one thing after another. Oh, and so they're calling me about this closing up North where I represent the buyer and that they haven't moved all their stuff out yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Was that the third closing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: That was the third closing, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098618\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: That's not the trash in the yard, [that was the earlier one]. But this is \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Right, this is a separate issue, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: So it's like \u2014 yeah, nothing is happening so they're working on it. That's all I can hope that that's what's happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So this feels, I guess, potentially catastrophic \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: \u2014 for you. Not quite like the world could come to an end, but something along those lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: That's the way it feels, yeah. I'm catastrophizing. Am I? Is that the right \u2014 catastrophizing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: That's the right word, but I guess I'm not looking at it so much in terms of that kind of a label but more in terms of wondering what's gotten [to you] in that way, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it's because I'm going on a trip and I'm just super anxious about that, you know. I don't know, but it just \u2014 all week I've been finding reasons to be nervous about these closings, you know, that they wouldn't happen. I'm still nervous that something is going to go wrong <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">with this third closing where I'm waiting for the check, beyond just having there be enough money for the wire. (pause) I've just got this kind of \"what else could go wrong?\" attitude, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Well, is it like this? So, you're in a lot of debt, you got really depressed, you really couldn't work for a while, declared bankruptcy, [business is in debt] and then really slow for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: You know how to cheer a guy up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) And now things are picking up a bit, and now you're kind of starting to get back on your feet really, and things are kind of more financially viable than they have been in a while, in a long time I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">But you're not that long out of the abyss and I imagine feel like you could fall back in very easily and that would, you know, bring with it all kinds of stress, certainly. It's so stressful having no money coming in and no work or not much work and, you know, shame. It feels like shit. I wonder if <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">that's what you're so scared of. You feel like a little slip could put you, like you could fall back in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I got an e-mail from my landlord. I asked him for an accounting of how much I owed. He's still like I owe five months and I just don't \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Is this home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and this makes no sense to me. It's like I thought I had been catching up. I thought I was maybe two or three months behind at the most. Now I've got to go through my records and it's just \u2014 (pause) I made enough money from yesterday to make an extra payment and still pay for my car. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So I guess in the way I'm hearing your response as letting me know that you still are kind of in the whole more than you realize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's like I thought I would get this big settlement, and this would solve all my problems, and I'd be caught up and I'd have extra money. The reality is that I don't, you know. Yeah, it caught me up a lot, but I had $5,000 between legal bills and accounting bills. That was more than half <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD1\">the settlement right there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: And Jess, we each put in 500 bucks and then I kick in 2500 bucks.

I mean, going to get her the computer and to sort all that out. It sounds kind of like something you have to do for work. Do you know what I'm saying? More so than it sounds like you're just kind of passively asking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201351\">and expecting other people to do for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">It seems more like you're kind of frustratingly and very worriedly running around to take care of things other people aren't doing right. The bank didn't fucking get the checks in there. They're not displaying your goddamn account. They haven't got whatever the problem is fixed. This guy didn't bring <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201391\">that to the closing. The other people didn't, you know, get the signatures right on the signatory page. The woman didn't get it back to you late. The bank didn't get you that form until 47 hours before the closing. Actually, what you're describing is taking on everybody else's mistakes. I know you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201392\">some responsibility for those, and it doesn't work out well for you if those don't get taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">But the more I describe it, the more I'm kind of confident actually that it sounds much more like the situation of you taking care of a very worried, not very capable in some sense, mother than like your being her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">CLIENT: I was just wondering, you know.

I can imagine there are some jobs where it's just kind of like that. The buck stops with you, and your job is somehow magically to make sure everybody else, over whom you have very little control, does exactly what they're supposed to do when they're <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D1\">supposed to do it. And that's how you describe it. I guess, clearly putting it that way, I'm a little skeptical and I wonder about your probably mostly unconsciously feeling very responsible in ways that you may not actually be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2014C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098618\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">And if I'm really going to run with this, my next thought is I wonder if that started with you and your mother. You know, if her difficulty doing different sorts of things and her kind of helplessness and anxiety and your trying to sort of take care of her and do things for her and make things better <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201511\">for her are kind of the prototype for this.

It's not my responsibility.

It's just \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: So I guess there are sort of additional logistics and some headaches. Then again, it's hard for me not knowing the realities, but I'm suspicious about whether that \u2014 (pause) I mean, you're really anxious. You haven't slept \u2014 like you didn't sleep well the other night, you were up at 5:30, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B1\">you know, really worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">It doesn't quite add up to me \u2014 I know (inaudible) \u2014 but it doesn't quite add up to me that that's because otherwise you might have two or three hours of extra work. You know what I mean? The degree of anxiety seems to be a little out of proportion to those real consequences, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah, it seems out of proportion to me too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. I'm not saying a few more hours of work isn't a pain in the ass, especially when you have to do everything remotely. I get that.

There's 259 in the account, but I'm about 600 short of the payoff amount. But I had deposited a check yesterday.
