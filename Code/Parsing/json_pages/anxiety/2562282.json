And you on your bill had a $500 amount that I\u2019m paying in January. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: But I thought you had paid me in January. Did you not pay me in January?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: No I haven\u2019t paid you since July.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: A long time ago? Okay, all right then that was just a mistake. I thought you paid me that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: But I think I, I think I might owe you $200 but I don\u2019t think so also because [laughs] if I only owe you for five sessions from last year, that should be $250, not $500.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Right. The $500 from January, did you, were you thinking that was the sessions from last year?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Oh no that was just a mistake on my part. I thought you paid me in January but I must have made an error.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Okay. Do I owe you that much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Well yes, I counted it against your balance I guess. In other words I recorded it as a payment because I had missed it when I thought that you had paid me back in January.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes. But you hadn\u2019t incorporated the five sessions that I owe you for last year? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I think I did in the bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Okay. When I said the bill looks right I don\u2019t think I really looked at it that good apparently. But that\u2019s what I\u2019m paying you, $2,400.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Okay. Thanks, yes, I\u2019ll suffer through that one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay. Let me know sometime. I went skiing this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Oh wow. Where did you go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:04:11] []. Have you been there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: No, I have not been back to the skiing thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: It\u2019s pretty skiing thingy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: They also have wineries and a show, which I went to once a while ago but I haven\u2019t been to the ski thing. That maybe is two completely different things that just happened to be in the same area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Well I imagine the mountain valley is a good place to have, to grow grapes for three months of the year. My only other skiing experience was in Portland last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Oh wow. Yes, that\u2019s a whole different thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Totally different. Yes, I was wistful for Portland. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yes. Did you go to the top of Portland when you were there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t go to the top of Portland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: I mean skiing-wise if it\u2019s your first ski trip it would be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Yes, that wasn\u2019t in the cards yesterday in terms of skiing, but it was raining the whole time we were there so it wasn\u2019t a great let\u2019s be outside for a long time except that I was outside for a long time when I was skiing but then I was stuck outside skiing. So I went to wherever the easy blue-colored <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">runs started on Portland. It still felt really, really, really high. I was able to keep a lot of stability on my ski this weekend even though I had completely forgotten and had to relearn. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562282\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">I\u2019ve been having tantrums, breaking down and crying every day since Monday I guess until Saturday when I completely blew up at Jeremy. It\u2019s quite a luxury I realized to be in a relationship to have that outlet. [inaudible at 00:08:06] when you are single and live alone. It\u2019s a very different kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">emotional management when you live alone. I love that about Jeremy. And I\u2019ve gone skiing and then yesterday went hiking or on my woods walk with my friend Brenda (ph), which we try to do many weekends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">Over the course of the blowout through the woods walk when I came back I\u2019m feeling this really big shift. So I blew up at Jeremy for crowding me in the kitchen but it was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what it was really about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: why are you crowding me? And tears, tears, tears. And then which was not that unusual for me at least these days. But I think over the course of our relationship I\u2019ve, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve averaged a random cry every three or four days for less. Jeremy could tell you the number. Yes, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">when I look back and I wonder if I\u2019ve had anything pent up, sometimes I think no I got a lot out in various ways and I think back to how I just cry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">And not adult crying like here. I call the crying I do here adult cry because it\u2019s a tear or two, maybe there\u2019s some weeping involved. But that thing you said about a child having such intense emotions and not really being able to contain them is just child gets them to the adult for the other person, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">I think that\u2019s my primary mode of crying for my whole life. So it\u2019s hard now because it\u2019s really easy to slip back into that at home with Jeremy. But I realize it when it\u2019s happening. There\u2019s something going on and I can\u2019t express it so I\u2019m just spilling it all over the room and seeing what you do with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">So what I was able to figure out in that moment or over the course of the next hour was that Jeremy hadn\u2019t gone skiing with me and Jeremy was talking for days and days about whether he should buy a beard trimmer and he\u2019s just talking about it and not doing anything. And he\u2019s been talking for months, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">for four years or something about production and works on it all the time and really hasn\u2019t finished anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">And he\u2019s bursting at the seams with passion and creativity and interest and he can\u2019t figure out how to get to know what\u2019s standing in his way to converting it into some shareable currency. And this is not a goal that I have imposed on him; this is a goal that Jeremy feels frustrated about for himself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s be clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: As opposed to the other goals. But yes, but then the whole blowup was about another goal that I\u2019ve imposed on him which is what are you doing? You\u2019re not doing anything. You\u2019re not buying the beard trimmer, you\u2019re not going skiing, you\u2019re talking about how you don\u2019t want to go skiing because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">you want to work on music; that is awesome. And then you spend four hours making beef stew which I was very appreciative about but that\u2019s the certain way it goes week after week after week. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562282\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">It\u2019s like I can\u2019t do this with you, I can\u2019t do this social thing because I want to work on music. And then something happens and the music isn\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Oh I see; the beef stew was in place of doing the music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes. And it\u2019s the best beef stew I\u2019ve ever had and it\u2019s really, really pretty and he cleaned up the entire kitchen afterwards so he did a great job making beef stew. But where\u2019s the fucking track? So that was the extent of what I was frustrated about. And so I said I\u2019m frustrated with you. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">don\u2019t want you to lay my frustrations on you. I am adjusting to them and I\u2019m trying to deal with it. I\u2019m very sorry that I blew up at you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">So Jeremy says well are you frustrated a lot? I said yes. And he got very, very sad and wanted to know more. And that\u2019s not so great because I\u2019m not sure that your wife being frustrated at you is a reasonable reason to do anything or change anything in this realm of his life. What? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: No, I didn\u2019t really have anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: You\u2019re full of shit, but okay you don\u2019t have anything to say. Okay so I\u2019m frustrated at him for not finishing a track. What are you supposed to do? So anyway he asked me about, or he just wouldn\u2019t he was feeling very sad -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just going to put my contact lens in here. Yes, he\u2019s very sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: that I am frustrated with him often. And I explained that my frustration is coming not so much from the facts or the fact that he hasn\u2019t finished a track but that there\u2019s a seeming lack of search or contemplative investigative insight driven process. He\u2019s sort of not really meeting the challenges <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">in a way in my opinion that\u2019s going to lead to lasting change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">And that\u2019s a really complicated frustration because well I\u2019m doing all these things and I\u2019m going to yoga four times a week and meditating twice a day and I see Jay a million times a week and I talk about it all the time. Actually over the course of the next day I realize that that and how little room <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">it leaves for my Ph.D. is actually what is incredibly hard for me to manage and contain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: All the stuff you\u2019re doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yes and my relationship to the stuff. And I mean sure I\u2019m frustrated at Jeremy for not finishing a track. I\u2019ve been frustrated with Jeremy for not finishing stuff for nine years; that\u2019s not new but it\u2019s there, it\u2019s real. And then I\u2019m frustrated with him for not being like me in his relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">to his challenges. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">But it\u2019s not sometimes he\u2019ll read it as like he thinks I\u2019m a super hardcore meditation and psychoanalysis proselytizer. And I think I probably am, I probably sound that way and I think there\u2019s something genuine about it there but the way that I\u2019m doing it to him is so counterproductive, very harmful <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">I think. So in this blowup he says what do you want me to do? I said well for example in psychoanalysis, and he says just drop it Allison (ph), drop it. I\u2019m never going to be in analysis; it\u2019s just not for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">And I said okay, you don\u2019t know that and you don\u2019t know what your analysis would be like. It would be nothing like mine because you\u2019re not like me. You\u2019re going to have different stuff come up. Or no one knows what you\u2019re going to have come up but it\u2019s probably not going to look nothing like mine and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">I encourage you to be more neutral about it. I\u2019m sorry I collared your opinion about it so much. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562282\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">But then he talks about how important meditation will be for him when he finally does it. I mean he said that a couple times. But I think there\u2019s something about my obsessive, intense relationship with him right now that\u2019s making him stay far away. So I think fine, I don\u2019t care what you do, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">care what it is that leads you to insight but what\u2019s very, very hard is for me to begin to see different ways of thinking about myself and have some sense that there is a new way of being possible. There\u2019s a new way; there\u2019s a way that I could never have known before. And to see you sort of fumbling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">along without too much of a hope or a vision or a sense of what\u2019s true for yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">Jeremy\u2019s so respectful; he could\u2019ve been I mean it was such a hurtful, it\u2019s such a hurtful thing to hear and all he said was I\u2019m very sad, Allison (ph). I feel like you had thrown many second arrows at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Many what? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Second arrows. The story about first and second arrows on an unenlightened person that\u2019s hit with the first arrow and it\u2019s incredibly painful, hurts a lot, an excruciating sensation throughout the body. And then immediately he impales himself with all these second arrows, why did I get hit in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">this place, I have to get food, my family -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Like a [inaudible at 00:22:41]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s a clean and dirty pain. So he said I feel like you\u2019re hitting me with all these second arrows. And I think he\u2019s right. I\u2019m there\u2019s so much clean pain already there and Jeremy\u2019s whole relationship to himself has been so fraught with dirty pain for a long time. And I\u2019m coming in and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">saying you\u2019re not doing it right; you need to leave and change or you need to pursue something that\u2019s different from what you\u2019re doing. Where is your search? I don\u2019t see you searching. I don\u2019t see you doing anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">But I still have a good point. I tried to make it clear that while it might feel like I am throwing lots of second arrows at him there\u2019s an intrinsic, there\u2019s something in what I\u2019m saying that suggests that I think that some of the first arrows can be changed or his relationship to the first arrows <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">can be changed or actually some of the clean pain I think can go away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">But honestly there\u2019s so little clean pain left that most of what I was trying to say is there\u2019s so much opportunity to change the way you\u2019re relating to your challenges. And it\u2019s going to be really hard but I think it\u2019s possible and I think you can be a musician full-time. I think you could totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">be meant to be a musician all day and all night, no other job. But not like this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me that, I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re not right about any number of things that you\u2019re thinking or saying to him, but it also seems to me like you may have a lot of trouble kind of bearing his passivity and sensitivity. It seems to me like when you\u2019re kind of reactive in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">a way that I think you don\u2019t want to be or like to be it\u2019s a reaction to those things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes. There\u2019s something very desperate about my approach to my own emotional life something very active and anxious and -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562282\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: You have a compulsive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s almost, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a reaction to the fear of being defeated or feeling passive myself or my hating it in Jeremy. And it\u2019s important to realize that this Saturday night thing is like a tip of a very, very long enlarged baggage-ladened iceberg. Or in school the conversations <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">were so much more charged because it wasn\u2019t are you going to be a musician or not; it was are you going to pass this semester? And it was you said you would do this and instead you\u2019re making beef stew and now it\u2019s 2:00 a.m. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: So I think some of what I feel are triggers, old triggers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: My impression is this is actually a relatively mild and kind of sort of less compacted version of what you guys have been doing for a long time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes. And I think what was hard about the way that Jeremy struggled through college is that his finally graduating wasn\u2019t a result of some beautiful pain. I mean there\u2019s tons of pain but pain that feels productive, insight may be the way I would describe what my life feels like. And maybe I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">to feel that way about it for it to feel okay. Maybe there\u2019s no other choice for me because I can\u2019t bear to sort of stand by the way that he is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">So there his graduating wasn\u2019t like that at all. He was really lucky to find this incredibly perceptive and just hardworking and good academic coach, Gwen (ph), whose house he just did his work at. And she took over the job as mother slash girlfriend slash whatever. And so he paid to be yelled at <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">or to be guided through all the things and he barely squeaked by. And some of the work was really, really, really outstanding; he got an A on his senior thesis and his defense was there\u2019s some bright spots. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: What did he study?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: He studied how the visuals he studied visual vision, visual system in salamanders as a model for how light cues are processed by retinal ganglia cells as the first sort of light -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:30:44] processing emitter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: My walk with Brenda (ph) was surprising because when I talked about this she had all this stuff to say which is very helpful to me. Briefly the two main things that she had to say were around comparing our narratives. Here I am in this new, I have this new relationship to pain and darkness and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">all these things and I just bounce from one thing to another and that\u2019s really my whole life. And I feel very strongly about it and I have all this energy about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">And in some ways that\u2019s characteristic. I mean she\u2019s known me since the 9th grade and she said in some ways this journey is no different from 9th grade Allison (ph) in whatever you were doing then. But in some ways it\u2019s starting to be a little different because actually the nature of the things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">you\u2019re doing are at times allowing a lot more space for steadiness and letting go, settling down with new and old pain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">But still there\u2019s a very large part of it that\u2019s still these are my extracurricular activities or really I haven\u2019t been doing any work so this is my life, this is what I do. And then there\u2019s Jeremy who\u2019s been dealing with this stuff for so long and it must be annoying as hell for me to come in. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562282\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I do think maybe one of the places in your life you feel is a little less like Jeremy is at times in relating stuff with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Like the sort of, yes like not driving the bus. Not knowing how to drive, not being able to drive, being driven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Sometimes underneath it you are passive and defeated and kind of wanting to be able to deal with it and feeling like you can\u2019t and feeling just upset and frustrated and sad and kind of uncomprehending. The reason I bring it up is because I wonder if there\u2019s clearly there\u2019s a lot that goes <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">into this between you and Jeremy. I\u2019m not at all trying to reduce it to this but I do wonder if sort of one aspect of the blowup and for this is the way of okay you can take this bite of things because I don\u2019t want to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: The aspect of this that I\u2019m wondering about among other aspects of why you got mad at him for this is because he is a convenient place to deposit these feelings you have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Because of for how long he\u2019s been dealing with those feelings himself and how much he deals with them now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Sure. This is going to make you sound worse than I mean to but I think just to convey I mean he\u2019s a perfect target.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yes. He\u2019s also much better at it than I am. At least this is something that Brenda (ph) noticed which is sometimes it comes up for me that I can\u2019t just sit the fuck down. There\u2019s so much fighting for me and my, with you. I\u2019m always fighting with how the things you describe that you describe <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">very well underneath, passive, upset, uncomprehending I feel. And for all the pain that it causes Jeremy in his life, his relationship with his struggles, he\u2019s actually quite steady. Maybe a lot of it is suppressed and he won\u2019t be steady if it starts flying out in different ways but he\u2019s always sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C52\">of a little bit upset and doesn\u2019t ever <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s more accepting of having these kind of struggles in himself than you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: He can say yes, this is really hard for me and it sucks and I feel defeated but whatever, I\u2019m going to live my life and at least for a while that\u2019s how it is. Whereas you\u2019re always taking up arms -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: I say no, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: No way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: So Brenda\u2019s (ph) reading of this is my relationship to my work is maybe your reading of it as my relationship to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I see. Your work like your Ph.D. stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yes, like I\u2019m not doing it and my whole life is going from coping thing to coping thing and I\u2019m not, and I\u2019m really frustrated that I\u2019m not moving closer to finishing this paper. I think of course I\u2019m not moving closer to finishing this paper because I\u2019m doing all this other stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Are you not in the office a bunch? My sense is that you\u2019re in the lab a bunch too. I understand you\u2019re not in there the 80 hours that some people (ph) probably are -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m in the office six to eight hours a day these days. There are times when I\u2019m in the office a lot more. And then a lot of that time Joanne\u2019s really having a very hard time. I think she needs to speak with someone else but she\u2019s speaking with me a lot. So there\u2019s a lot of time that\u2019s spent <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">processing and I didn\u2019t realize this until last night after yes and then a lot of time is spent doing the things that are necessary to get the next thing finished. There\u2019s no, right now there\u2019s no, it\u2019s just not a priority. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562282\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">So the shift that I\u2019m feeling when I started out talking about is that I want to try to give myself a little bit more of a chance of finishing my Ph.D. in a way that I\u2019m proud of. And I think that\u2019s going to require being in the office a little more and just having a little bit different relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB1\">to my non-office stuff. Usually I\u2019ll start the day knowing when I\u2019m going to leave because there\u2019s meditation at 6:00 or boxing at 6:00 or yoga at 6:45 or something. And I think I can probably do without that aspect of planning. It\u2019s going to be very painful because my body starts to hurt and get uncomfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB2\">by then but I think I can incorporate brief workout breaks throughout the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">The other thing is it\u2019s very hard to start the week off leaving you. And let\u2019s just be clear that there\u2019s all of Monday, all of Tuesday, all of Wednesday and all of Thursday between -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Monday morning and Thursday, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Monday morning and Thursday afternoon and that was not, somehow I didn\u2019t notice. But basically the entire week is book-ended by seeing you. Friday doesn\u2019t really count because Kelly\u2019s (ph) not there on Fridays and somehow it\u2019s always kind of a different day. So my entire week is collared or <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">contained and that\u2019s very intense, painful separation thing. And while I\u2019m fine to walk around in a psychoanalytic haze for the years that I\u2019m with you, I think it\u2019s not necessary to have such a major I think what I\u2019m saying is I think I\u2019d like to start my week out in lab. So do you have other times? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Let me look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: It would be a big favor. I know it\u2019s annoying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: No, I don\u2019t mind arranging it if I can. Let me look around and see what I got.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Okay. I might, I might prefer to come here in the middle of the day if I know that I can have my morning. I can get in as early as I can. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Okay. We should stop for now but let me see what I can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
