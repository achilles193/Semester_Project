Anyway and so she had a grant coming up or something and she needed samples processed right away so I sent kind of out of normal <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">submission and that\u2019s fine. The company kind of, especially now since we\u2019re the same company notices (ph), that they do, I don\u2019t know, they gave me they said oh it might take longer because it was only six samples instead of usually we send 100 or something. All right, whatever, that\u2019s fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">But then I don\u2019t know for some reason when I\u2019m send the samples I fill out forms and tell what they are and all that jazz. For some reason there were mouse samples that they ran them on, a human chip, which has human genes instead of mouse genes and so that\u2019s a big mistake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Right, because that would mess everything up I would think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Right. And so yesterday I got the data back and I was just infuriated because I mean the first thing we noticed is everything was the same and [it\u2019s all] (ph) on the data. But then I go and look at it and asked why is this crazy, I don\u2019t know it was just a clump right in the middle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: And so that\u2019s on her, right? She could put this stuff on her own chip?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Right, on the company, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh it\u2019s on the company, not on Post-doc. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Right, on the company. And I have no idea why they did it or I don\u2019t know because we do send both, human and mouse, but I don\u2019t know. And I was so, I don\u2019t know, just all this trouble that comes with this company. And I feel like whenever something goes wrong with them or something, I\u2019m always <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">the dispatcher of bad news with all, with any samples. [Laughs] And they say well you (ph) never in particular this is [inaudible at 00:04:01] is the post-doc who takes samples and she spends so much time. She spends a lot of face time with me making sure that I treat her samples well because I understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">and she\u2019s nice enough and explains what they are. But it\u2019s because she, because it\u2019s just a lot of work to take these samples so I understand her input. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So, anyway, so yes this came at the end of the day yesterday and I was so just not wanting to deal with it. So, but I kind of just e-mailed them back asking why did this happen and if there\u2019s anything we can do. Sometimes there\u2019s left over materials and we can run again but I\u2019m not sure; they haven\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">answered me. But I don\u2019t know. When somebody gets to me I\u2019m not going to say anything to my boss or to her. I\u2019m just going to wait because, I don\u2019t know, one I think she\u2019s going to be really upset because that\u2019s [inaudible at 00:05:25].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">I don\u2019t know it\u2019s always, it gets blown out of proportion; we\u2019re asked to have a conference call with everyone at the company and I would have to explain what happened and, I don\u2019t know, it just making more work for me. And I don\u2019t know, I just kind of, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just kind of it\u2019s always <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">something with this company. And, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really know what to do if they say there\u2019s nothing we can do or there\u2019s nothing left over, whatever. But, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562418\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">But I guess, I don\u2019t know, I guess I kind of feel like because I\u2019ve been so busy in doing so many different things, I was thinking back, I doubled-checked that with the mouse, I definitely did and I found out but, I don\u2019t know <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: So you double-checked that you put mouse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes, instead of human run this under mouse array, [inaudible at 00:07:32] right. But I guess they send, before they actually hybridized (ph) them to the array they send a report and I\u2019m trying to think, I don\u2019t know. The report was fine but maybe it did say they were going to, I don\u2019t think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">so but they rerun it on human stuff but I don\u2019t know it just doesn\u2019t so easy. But, anyway <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: So they said they were going to run it on mouse stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure; I don\u2019t know. I think it depends on the, I don\u2019t know they give an I.D. for each sample and I have to look at that and see if I can tell by the label because of the numbers they have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019m aware (ph) that you feel in the middle of this catastrophe and as so, I don\u2019t know, maybe you\u2019re also the most vulnerable and nobody else is really going to take any of it on probably including me. Not that I would take on blame, you know well actually Katie it was me, but that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">talking with me about it you\u2019ll still feel like it\u2019s on you and up to you to deal with. And I won\u2019t help you feel; I\u2019ll sort of leave it there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. Yes, I mean I guess I feel responsible and there\u2019s, I mean they came to me; I just can\u2019t ignore it. And I guess I\u2019m just afraid me being negatively, like the post-doc samples our samples are, I don\u2019t know. Post-doc saying you can\u2019t manage, this is your job to work with these companies <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">and managing them but it\u2019s always something with them. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">So, I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I just, yes I mean I guess I\u2019ve got to feel like it\u2019s (ph) on me. I don\u2019t want to work with this company any more. This company is much trouble and I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m constantly being kind of asked or from everyone that I submit my [inaudible at 00:13:15] and the tables for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I ask is it going to pass QC\u2019s or is it going to pass quality controls or is the data going to be good, high cells off. I mean they answer all these questions but it\u2019s just constant worry they\u2019re going to, I don\u2019t know. Especially when it\u2019s, I think I described it as a black box kind of sending these <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">samples away and I don\u2019t know what happens there. I know what kits they use, I know the protocol but I\u2019m not there to quality them or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">But, I don\u2019t know. And yes I mean the company can give us a refund or whatever but it doesn\u2019t make up for <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: It wouldn\u2019t change the credit deadline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. So, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So yes I\u2019d imagine that when people give you the samples they are the end product of a lot of work that they\u2019ve done. And then it\u2019s sort of they\u2019re both, I mean they\u2019re so invested in learning the results they\u2019ve gotten from the samples and so they\u2019re always intense and anxious with you about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">it. And the company on the other side I gather is just kind of flaky and inconsistent? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Well I guess the results are. I mean, yes, the data -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562418\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I see, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Somehow we\u2019ve gotten I think it was September or October everything was failing and we didn\u2019t know why and it ended up being one of their operators who wasn\u2019t doing something right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: At the company?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: I see. There\u2019s really two things to contend with that you never really know at the time, which it is. There\u2019s error on the part of the company and then there\u2019s the science just not turning out the way that people want which I understand happens all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. Another thing too is what people give me isn\u2019t always the best quality, what [inaudible at 00:16:18], how healthy the cells are, et cetera. So if they fail it\u2019s not always my fault or the company\u2019s fault; it might be their fault. And just in terms of why I have no idea; it could be you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">it could be me, the company, or it just could be this sometimes things don\u2019t work. And there\u2019s no rhyme or reason. I\u2019ve looked into this extensively at why samples fail. Is it from every point of variability I\u2019ve looked and there\u2019s no correlation, there\u2019s no, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Yes, I mean there\u2019s a little bit more if you have more cells then the samples usually do better but that\u2019s not always the case. There\u2019s a sweet spot and we try to aim for but sometimes things wave a little. It\u2019s a gamble; sometimes people just say all right we\u2019ll just try it. We know it\u2019s a very low, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">got a lower climb and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes and then something in the sweet spot will fail so, I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s no and so it\u2019s hard to explain I guess so I kind of give a reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re the one who gives people the bad news and deals with their immediate reaction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: And that gets extremely stressful where you can\u2019t <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right. And yes and also, I don\u2019t know, it makes me kind of yes, vulnerable to other people and their judgment. Yes, it\u2019s nice when I can say oh your sample\u2019s back; here\u2019s your data. It\u2019s usually okay thanks, that\u2019s great. But when something goes bad it\u2019s kind of why, why, and I can\u2019t give a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">clear cut answer so I feel like I\u2019m always kind of judged or kind of viewed negatively and, I don\u2019t know. I want to seem competent; I want to seem capable or kind of have a trust with their samples or whatever but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of much more dramatic. It reminds me a little bit of the military, you have to inform both of the loved ones who died or something like that. I mean it\u2019s not quite like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: I know. I mean it\u2019s not always bad or yes it\u2019s just and people don\u2019t always react like they\u2019ll send 10 samples to [] (ph). Okay, they\u2019re happy that tonight that\u2019s doable (ph) but it\u2019s just weird. They hide (sp) them to the wrong shipments, and kind of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Wait, they what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: They it\u2019s called hybridization, they hide (sp) them to the wrong shipment. It\u2019s kind of like friendly fire or something, right? I don\u2019t know. [Pause] But we\u2019ll see if it works out. I guess also what I\u2019m a little worried about is, I don\u2019t know. This is kind of this whole working with this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">company, processing samples and all that is kind of what I\u2019m going to have to teach or kind of pass on to the person replacing me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562418\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">And again it kind of feels so uncertain and I\u2019m leaving them without a good understanding or just kind of vague, the book that\u2019s on them, or how to properly use them, work with the company, work with people, and I don\u2019t know. It just feels very not regimented or something, kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Like there\u2019s not a sort of well-defined protocol? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right. I mean I can think of the reason why they probably hyde (sp) them to human because that\u2019s not out of order and the only time they do that is when there are human samples or I sent them a small amount of figures and the argument is most people do that. That\u2019s probably why they thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">it was similar because it was a small shipment from our lab, blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">So, I don\u2019t know. And, so it can\u2019t be well always just send the monthly shipment but she needed these things faster than we know what the connection. So I don\u2019t know it\u2019s kind of always messy. They don\u2019t teach that or I guess I feel vulnerable because [inaudible at 00:27:11] or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yes, I guess there\u2019s messiness all around, really. I mean certainly with dealing with the company but also with people\u2019s reactions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">I guess, yes I mean it\u2019s kind of, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s part of my job or whatever and I\u2019ve been dealing with it for years but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just everything it didn\u2019t seem as bad for the first two years; there was no major screw ups. And the first major screw up that they, the company did have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">was actually was all my samples. So it didn\u2019t really, yes, it sucked but at least I didn\u2019t have to deal with other people but last week I did, yes. And but now it seems like things creep up and, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">I guess I just, I don\u2019t know. I always feel I don\u2019t want to complain or kind of make excuses or something about, I don\u2019t know, anyone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re constantly starting to feel like you\u2019re [inaudible at 00:31:47]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Right, well just in me, I don\u2019t know. This is one thing, one small aspect of running the rest of the job and I was feeling like what do I have to do today and hopefully they\u2019ll reply. And then I have to deal with other things too and not wanting there\u2019s just so much responsibility that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">kind of, I\u2019m holding up or cleaning up the messes or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m a little confused. I mean I think I got what you meant when you said you don\u2019t want to complain or make excuses. And also I mean I get that this is only one small part of what you do and that you\u2019re feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the responsibility that you have and the other stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">you have to deal with like the messes you have to clean up. I guess the thing I\u2019m not sure about is how that, the one follows from the other. My sense is that you have a sense of how those things are connected, not willing to complain or make excuses and feeling like it\u2019s just a small part of what you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">do and that you\u2019ve got more on you than you want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Maybe you don\u2019t and that\u2019s fine, I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Well I was just going to say that, yes it\u2019s just the feeling of being overwhelmed and I wanted to complain I had a million other things to do and this is kind of, I don\u2019t know, just something I really don\u2019t want to deal with or really don\u2019t want to think about. So yes, then that other thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">I think I just I wanted to complain but then God (ph) it\u2019s always something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562418\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I see. But I imagine because you worry that complaining would make you feel bad in a way that would make all this, make you feel more overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Because you feel that\u2019s not how you\u2019re supposed to be and because [inaudible at 00:35:52] yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Right. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of because I can\u2019t allow myself to complain or say [that I was] (ph), or say I\u2019ve got other things to do. Anyway it\u2019s kind of that same kind of feeling like hanging out with Marlowe. It\u2019s kind of backsliding or feeling sorry for myself or I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re feeling this kind of like you let yourself go far enough in talking in the way you did about what\u2019s been giving you trouble in dealing with the company and with what just happened yesterday. And the point is not to let that turn into a bunch of complaining about stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: I mean I think it just makes everything else harder and so does I mean, yes I mean something heavier and I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m hard (ph) and don\u2019t want to do anything kind of. And so, I don\u2019t know. And I know since we have something, lately I\u2019ve been a little bit more, if I can describe it, like not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">taking out Marlowe and just be more to myself. I\u2019m better able to keep from doing things like working and stuff. I don\u2019t know, just a product of that, just moving I guess and keep working. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I wonder if there\u2019s also if you start to feel like you were complaining it would feel like something a little different between you and me. I mean if I were sort of listening and attentive while you were complaining, you would start to feel more, more down on yourself but also more helpless, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">vulnerable, in need of my taking care of you or something like that and maybe that doesn\u2019t sit well with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Right. Yes, that\u2019s exactly it. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. In a way it\u2019s something like this [inaudible at 00:42:08] with the company. I guess it feels like there\u2019s no making it better; there\u2019s no, yes this sucks but there\u2019s no solution or, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Well why don\u2019t we stop?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
