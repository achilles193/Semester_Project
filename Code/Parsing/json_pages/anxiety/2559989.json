The insurance has started to kick in so it's going to take some time to figure out how much they paid. I think, in fact though, because we're doing these things now it's probably more than what you used to be paying; so it's probably going to go against <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">your balance. It's going to cut into your balance, if that makes sense, because with this and what the sessions pay through the insurance, it's probably going to be over what you used to pay so it's going to be taking away from your balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Well, that's nice for both of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: For both of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: For my anxiety and for your wallet. Okay. We're good. I continued working at getting a job so we'll see how it goes.  I'm working with a recruiter now, potentially two, if the other one is actually serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you were talking about that last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. Every waking moment is filled with dread is how I greeted Ginny this morning. I got an Ironman shirt $10. It glows in the dark, too, it turns out. I was pleasantly surprised. I came back from the bathroom we have a full-length mirror on the way out of the bathroom in the hall. It came <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">with the house. I turned all white. The light is glowing on my shirt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Every day how did you put it to Ginny?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Every waking moment is filled with dread. This weekend trip is coming up to DC. I'm just like I spend every moment thinking about the dread of going and the anxiety of going.  The only thing you can do to make it better is to not go. So I wrote an e-mail today to my parents and said, 'Listen, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">I'm not going.\" Done. I'm not going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What were you going to go down for? To visit your friend, Pete?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, we were going to go down as a group. We were going to drive down tomorrow afternoon. It's about a six-hour drive down to DC. And here are all the things I hate about it: One I'm in the car for several hours can't leave. Sucks. Two I don't know where I'm going to sleep. There are <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">places but none of them are in a bed. None of them are predictable. Three Saturday we're in DC and I'm trapped.  I can't decide when to leave DC, when to go. And Sunday we go to this bar called Player One that my friend runs and I'm at a bar for some period of time and I can't leave. Then we come <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">back late Sunday night and I'm in the car again for six hours and get back late Sunday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: A lot of trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Constantly trapped for a handful of hours of actual, positive interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: What was the car ride like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: It's me and Victor and Eugene and Darcy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: That's a long drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It's a long drive. The big part of it is I don't want to be trapped in a conversation with Victor for six hours.  So many conversations we're having these days are tension filled. He has all these imagined slights. Everything he hears is persecution. That's like all he hears. The other day we <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">were playing a card game and someone was like [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:18) was making this move because it's competitive. He's like, \"Dude. This is this and this and this.\" I'm like, \"It's not a big deal.\" He's like, \"Don't get on my case.\" Nobody's on your case. Eugene said, \"Yeah, Victor.\" Okay. Nobody <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">cares about what you do or why you do it. I don't know. But that's his entire thing everything is about him and everything is about . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559989\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: He's on edge or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: He's always on edge. His father's plane blew up over his house when he was about five. His father was an amateur pilot who flew prop planes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, you told me that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: And so his entire life can be summed up in \"if you make a mistake your plane blows up.\"  That's what his mother told him. \"Your father made a mistake.\" He was flying his plane and he made a mistake and it blew up. That was the defining moment of his life. If you make a mistake your plane blows <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">up. If you make a mistake you die. There was even a point when we were in college where he was like, \"No. I am never wrong.\" He said that with complete belief that he is never wrong. He says these ridiculous things like, \"I don't need other people to be successful. I don't need other people.\" This is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">that fallacy of the self-made man. There is no such thing. There has never been such a thing, especially for a straight white male in western New York growing up in a house that your parents owned with three brothers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: You've already got some whether you like it or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Exactly. All three of you got together with decent schooling with teachers that respected you and you were all born intelligent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: He's got the nice mother, the mother that you like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:12) squandered, the use of which he squandered. That's what blows me so much about this. He has all these advantages that I didn't have and he still has all these horrible flaws, like his belief that he doesn't need people. He has turned on ad blockers for all websites <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">and I don't agree with that as a way to exist in the world because those websites get their revenue from ads. He's like, \"No. They should find a different way to pay for their stuff.\" \"Okay, so what you're saying now is that service is free for everyone should be paid for by individuals on an individual <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">basis?\" He was like, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"Okay. So you want to pay a subscription to all the websites that you use?  Right now they're free, but you want to pay a monthly fee to every website that you use? That's what you're saying. That's the end result of this argument that you're putting forward.\" That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B3\">the thing that's always the problem. He makes these short-sighted, narrow-minded, self-centered arguments. That's the definition of stupid; you aren't thinking very far in any direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: This is the guy you're going to be in the car for six hours?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Twelve hours total. If intelligence is a sphere, which I think that it is, then his is very small. The larger that sphere, the more intelligent you are. The farther ahead you can look, the more variables you can encompass, the smarter you are. You can be very intelligent and not use any of that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">right? You can blind yourself to so much by just believing that you are special, that you can take credit for these things, for an accident of genetics. For one, it's an accident of genetics that you even exist in the first place, an accident of biology that you exist.  Then it's an accident of genetics <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">that you have intelligence. Then it's an accident of geography and culture that you are the most privileged class in the world -the rich straight white males in AmGeorgea, in industrialized countries. The second most privileged class in the world is middle class straight white males in other industrialized <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559989\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: You say he squanders it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Absolutely. He thinks he owes nothing to anybody. He has all this power but no responsibility and the more we grow up and he doesn't, the more frustrating this becomes to me, the more that I have this friend who for years we've been best friends, we were inseparable, and now I'm like, \"You are <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">not growing up. You have not changed. You still whine.\"  He still whines when he doesn't get his way. I'm like, \"You're a grown-ass man. Why are you whining?\" He has this ridiculous things. He has this Vent server. Do you know what a Vent is? Ventrillo? It's a voice-chat server and you can pay a monthly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">fee and you get server space and you can get the password out to various friends. They can have voice chat for various games and whatnot. You get different channel rooms. You get channels for different games. All the friends he has from [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:43). That was the first voice-chat server <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">that you could rent, but it's also the worst now. It's been surpassed, strongly surpassed by other options. In fact, Mumble is recognized as hands-down the best voice communication in the world. It's better than Skype, significantly better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: [Is it 802 forum?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: No. It comes with voice chat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: It's all voice chat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: It uses lower bandwidth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mumble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and there's a set-up process you use where it teams itself to your voice. It understands your loud voice and your whispers and it can accommodate for that for everybody, so it does the sound balancing automatically for everybody. So for voice chat for games, it's fucking the best. For <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">$10 a month you can have this server for 10 different people. If you're going to game, that the server. We all use it. Victor always wants us to use Vent and I'm like, \"Oh, Vent sucks.\" People constantly have a disconnect and reconnect because their voice goes robotic. You have to adjust everybody's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">sound level manually. It's like, \"Okay, what's your mic set on? Let me adjust for that.\" It's just fucking dense and it's working backwards. It's extremely last-century.  This is a turn-of-the-century technology, right? I'm like, \"No, I'm not using it. I'm using Mumble. We all are using Mumble. Only <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F3\">you use Vent.\" He's like, \"Well, my friends from World, they love it.\" They love having the free voice server. They don't have to pay for it. They show up, they have a voice server. He's like, \"On Mumble they control everything.\" And you have to. You have to control everything. I'm sitting there playing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F4\">on that thing when you and Kim, your girlfriend, and you tell her to disconnect and reconnect. What do you mean disconnect and reconnect? This is absurd. This is technology. Turn it off and on again. How often? Once every hour? I'm like, \"No, we're going to Rich's.\" And he's like, \"Well it kind of sucks <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F5\">that I pay all this money for a server and you guys won't use it.\" I'm like, \"How does that influence anything?  How does the fact that you pay money for it mean that we should use it?\" Victor says this. He pays money for a Ventrillo server. It's a service. He pays like $10 a month to host it. He's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F6\">like, \"I pay money.\" So basically if he pays money for something we are all obligated to use that thing instead of this other thing that our other friend pays money for.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559989\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah, he's got a way of almost like you've got to deal with him on his terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Exactly. Everything is about his terms. Everything is about \"no, you do it on my terms.\" He doesn't get it. He's never interested in me, either, in terms of when I had the anxiety attacks he doesn't understand. He was like, \"Why can't you just get over it? Why can't you just stop being anxious?\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">I'm like, \"Are you a fucking idiot?\" At the same time I want to be like, \"Why can't you stop being narcissistic? Why can't you try to look beyond yourself.\"  That's something you can actually change. That's a patterned thinking. That's not some sort of chemical disorder. That's a straight-out way that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">you look at the world and that's something you can change actively and you should because it's fucking reprehensible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right. I guess it's not only a function of him wanting to have the world exist on his terms, but he also can't enter into your world at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Right. He cannot see beyond himself. Every single relationship has failed because of him. Every single one. And Darcy Victor really likes her and she really likes him, but how long can that possibly last? They've been together a year. In the long distance, how long can it possibly last? She's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">very submissive, which actually works very well. She's her own person and everything, but she's perfectly willing to go with the flow, perfectly willing to deal with him [and his narcissism.] (ph?)  It's really good for him because he actually does accommodate her to a degree, but he is still the center <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200572\">of his world. We all are the centers of our own worlds to a certain degree, but we all . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: But there's a recognition that everybody . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: That everybody exists, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And in terms of you sort of saying that he hasn't grown, I think one of the ways in which he really hasn't grown is becoming a person that is able to kind of . . . Yeah, you're in your 20's and people are kind of comfortable being in their own world and not worrying about the others, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">as you get older, you want people that can kind of connect with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Right, and he doesn't understand it. He really thinks that he doesn't need other people which, obviously, you need other people. You really lose that. I just want to be like, \"You have nothing. You have a decent job and a long-distance girlfriend finally but you have nothing.  You have family <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">you come to see. You have us, but only to a degree.\" (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: It's something you really see about him. He's limited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:29) It's very difficult to hang out with him because everything revolves around his perception of what it is. I don't hang out with him much and it's sad because he moved up here [ ] best friends. He was the best man at my wedding. I work so hard for my shit not to affect <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">anybody else, so that's why this whole thing is an issue.  I wrote my friends, \"Hi, I'm not going. I'm sorry, but I'm not going this weekend.\" It literally consumes every moment and I can't spend the next day and a half dreading going and then being unable to leave. Hey, Fred, go to this incredibly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">anxious situation that you cannot stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559989\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: Is there anxiety in the car, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's the exact same thing. It's in the car; it's everywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: Are you kind of white-knuckling it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. Being in the car is awful.  Being on the highway for hours, it just gets worse and worse. It's terrifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: When you're in the car, what kind of comes to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Eventually he's going to say something stupid. (pause) He gets his ideas of how an experience is going to go and then he tries to force the experience to go that way; and if it doesn't he gets very agitated. He's like, \"No, Fred, I wanted us all to listen to this book on tape.\" Well what did <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">we want? What were the rest of us interested in doing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: It's just a matter of time before he says something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Right, and then I have to call him on it and I have to call him on it. I can't just sit there and let him do this. I can't do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Well, you don't want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Right, nor should I have to, right? And when someone has behavior that is bad or toxic or negative, why the fuck should I tolerate it? The answer is that I shouldn't. Tolerance of limited world views should not be tolerated. Oh, my dog killed a bird this morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: Which dog?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Hank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Hank did, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: I wake up and I go downstairs and I'm like, \"Hey, buddy. What's up?\" And he's hiding under Ginny's chair. I'm like, \"What's going on, buddy?\" And Ginny is like, \"Well, he's had a rough morning.\" Well, why? \"Well, I yelled at him pretty hard because he knocked down a bird's nest and killed a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">baby bird.\" She was like, \"I can't fault him for being a dog, right? Because he's a hound. That's his job. He's like I found this thing, I put it in my mouth. Good for me. Look what I did. I got it. It's in my mouth now.\"  And he doesn't understand that he's not allowed to eat it. He's like, \"I did <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">the right thing, right? I did it. Where's my reward? This is what I've been bred to do for hundreds of years find a thing in a tree, knock it down, put it in my mouth. I thought you were going to shoot it. (chuckles) Do you want to shoot it now?\" And then we're like yeah, we forget that he's a predator. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F3\">As adorable and cute as he is, he's a killer, though. The first time I saw him, he just snarls. I'm like, \"Oh, golly.\" He's like, \"Look. Animal. I can eat it.\" That's pretty good. So I've been really careful with the animals we want him to be around. We would never let him be around a cat because he'd <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F4\">probably lose an eye. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Or take a bite out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Or try to and the cat will fucking blind him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Oh, they'll both lose an eye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, that would be nuts. Cats are incredibly Logangerous to dogs because dogs don't understand. Dogs don't understand what can happen. Dogs fight for dominance like, \"I will throw you to the ground and that will be it. And you'll be like 'Oh, God. I'm sorry.'\" Cats are like, \"No, no. We're <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">murderers. That's what we do to survive all the time. That's our life.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559989\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: We're bred to deal with the predators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, because they're supposed to be bigger predators, Logangerous predators. Dogs are hunters and companions and workers and soldiers. Cats are killers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Right. Cats are more predators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that's everything they're built for is to leap and chase and evade and kill. That's why they have fucking claws. Dogs have long toenails and they can scratch you with those, but cats kill you.  Larger cats will fucking eviscerate you. Bobcats even. They'll jump on your chest with their <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">front paws and cling and their back claws will come up and scoop you out. One swoop and you're dead, almost dead. You're eviscerated. You will die within the next few minutes while it eats your entrails in front of you. (pause) There you go. Killers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Killers. Yeah. And I guess is it in a way with Victor . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Right. I can't fault him for his nature except that he can change his nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: And you're sort of saying \"I've got my nature, too\" which is \"I don't like this stuff and I want to tell him about it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Right. And I try very hard not to let this shit affect other people, affect their plans, what they're doing.  The fact that there are several going gives me an out. I'm like, \"Listen, this trip is not canceled.\" I cannot cancel this trip. I can simply back away from it. I tried. I honestly tried <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">to do this. I was like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go. It's going to be fun. We're going to have a good time. We'll go down for the weekend. We'll go.\" As it gets closer and closer I was like, \"No. This is awful, just awful.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: It sounds like, too, that some of it is that you're going to go after Victor if he pulls any kind of nonsense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Right, that's part of it, but the rest of it is that I know what I'm going to feel. I know when it comes time to figure out where we're sleeping I'm going to be incredibly stressed about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What is the situation? Do you even know . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: There is a couch and a fold-out double bed. I would probably bring an air mattress, but where does the air mattress go?  When do I decide to go to sleep? There is a possibility that our friend, Logan, who lives a little bit away, would host one of us in his guest room; but then I have to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">out how do I get to Logan and how do I get back? And I have no control over that. It would be nice to see their kid, as well, Logan's son's wife. We kind of get along pretty well because I always hit it off with women. Always.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: So all that yeah. What is it, when you think about sleeping, what does it stir up for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: I mean they have cats. Cats that are like, \"Hey, what are you doing?\" They mess with you while you're sleeping. They jump on your feet. I don't like that at all. I don't want that to be the case. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you want to have a place where you feel safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Safe. I want to feel safe when I sleep. And so to have to look out for cats when I go to sleep is not good for me. It is not good for me. It's awful. I hate it. I absolutely hate it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, some creature lurking around.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559989\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: I had a cat once. We had two cats. We got them when I was eight. Ginger and Ivan. Ginger was an orange tabby and Ivan was a black and white. They were both from the same litter.  Ivan was not cool. He was very stand-offish. Ginger was very friendly. I woke up one morning and Ginger was sleeping <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB1\">on my arm next to me. I was like, \"This is nice. I like this.\" We let them just walk. We lived in the country. They would just go off and they would come back and go off and come back. One day Ivan came back with his front arm opened up, bared to the muscle. I never saw Ginger again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Same day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Same day. They both went out and one came back. One came back wounded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Oh, boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: And I never saw the other one again. We were like, \"What happened?\" The good cat died and the bad cat stayed for several years.  We were living in Wallingford when I was about 11 or so or 12 and we moved to Cheshire and my mother abandoned Ivan there. We just didn't take him with us when we <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">moved. She was like, \"The hippies next door like to feed him and hang out with him anyway, so they'll take him in.\" (pause) So we just ditched him. That was fine because I never liked him. And we had a baby. We had my brother, Kevin, and my mother was like, \"Oh, the cat will try to smother the baby.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: The cat will try to smother the baby?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Cats do that. [They'll lie on the baby's face sometimes until it chokes.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: Who knows if that's real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I think there's even a movie about it, about cats stealing children's breath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That sounds like some sort of movie. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: While they're sleeping. Cats smothering the baby. Wow. (pause) That's not real. That's' not real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: I watched Ironman I and II and The Avengers again. Those are great movies. Those are great movies.

I think about it and then I just want to kill myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: You think about what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: I think about Ironman and Ironman II and The Avengers. Those movies are so good and I can never have that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: What is it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: I don't know.

It's just better where they are.

You get to be better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah.  I don't have to be like what I am. I'm working through recruiters. I'm looking at jobs and I'm like, \"These are all terrifying to me.\" I played the lottery twice this weekend because the Powerball is like $200 million $350 million. I might as well try a couple of times, right? A fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">roll of the dice. Why the fuck not? [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:38) Playing three times a year, there's just an infinitesimal chance; more than once a year, right? I understand the probability goes up if I play every day and I'm more likely to win than somebody who plays once a day; but still, that chance <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D72\">is so small.  Play once a day every year for ten years is effectively the same chance as only playing once in ten years. It won't cost you $2, it would cost you $460 if you play the Powerball three times a week. If you play four times a week, your totals will be 52 weeks, $416 a year for ten years, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D73\">$4,160.

Then nobody is ever going to employ me, right? No one is ever going to want to hire me. It's like where have you been? Three different places in three years. Why? Because I can't stay.

I got lucky. I was in the right place at the right time. Viacom bought the company I worked at and I bought a house. That is simple.  They gave me a bonus package of $187,000 over three years, so I bought a house. I bought a house, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201291\">I started a company, I invested in some other shitty companies and some other stuff that I worked to pay off.

Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">CLIENT: I make sure I go for walks. There's nothing to do except go to the store and look at all the games that I can't buy, that I shouldn't buy and that I don't buy; the comic books that I don't have any interest in buying.  I was looking and the value proposition is ridiculous. I thought maybe I'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201311\">get an Ironman-something. It was $15 for six issues of a comic book that I'm going to read once and is mostly pictures. There is actually very little that actually happens. I'm like, \"No, this is ridiculous. That's absolutely stupid. Collecting comics is stupid.\" (pause) The Avengers is amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">THERAPIST: Why? What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">CLIENT: I see these actors. I finally got enough emotional distance from the movie that I could watch the making-of stuff, the behind-the-scenes stuff, because I don't want to see that curtain pulled back.  Now it's been long enough that I can actually watch that. Just seeing so many of the actors, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201351\">some of the actors doing their own stunts and being physical and the way they do these things is so amazing. (pause) It's the thing I can't be because I wouldn't want to leave my house.

I had enough of those that I could turn it in for a $100 Amazon <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201411\">gift card. That's amazing. So that's what I did. I ordered some games off Amazon, which was cool. I got one called Mice and Mystics, which is a dungeon crawler in the Secret of Nimh style. It's cooperative. I actually got Ginny to play with me and it was a lot of fun.
