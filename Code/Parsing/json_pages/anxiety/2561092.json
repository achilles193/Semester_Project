I was actually talking to him, \u2018like I don\u2019t even know what to talk to her about like in therapy.\u2019 But it was pretty much like finances have been stressful for me because the whole other week the government didn\u2019t pay us and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I had to wait two more week to get my paycheck. So I took out like a convenience check and like I had an agreement with them that I\u2019d pay that back by December 20th and then they didn\u2019t even give me time to pay it back. They took it out of my check the next month like before they even gave me what they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">owed me \u2013 this paycheck, like half my paycheck went back to them. So we\u2019re out of cable right now which doesn\u2019t bother me but it bothers him. So we had a fight over that because I was like, either way them taking it out like that is going to set me behind a couple of months. And he was like, oh so how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">long will we not be without cable? And I\u2019m like, so I said to Steve, \u2018when you pay it.\u2019 It\u2019s not just my responsibility to pay the bills. And said I was being mean. This is life. I can\u2019t take care of you forever. You have to be just as responsible about the bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So I\u2019m angry right now. But whenever we fought I would get so upset that I needed him to console me and I never could make a point with him if I was like \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 because I needed to be consoled by him. Now, I\u2019m like I\u2019m not sorry. I can console myself. Like, I\u2019m upset, like I know how to do that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">now. I don\u2019t need you to console me. And I\u2019m just trying to get through to him because any time we fought I would be the one like \u2018oh, sorry. This is all me.\u2019 And he still pushes back in my face. He\u2019s like, with certain things he\u2019ll be like, I told him a while ago I don\u2019t date people that smoke, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">date people who do dope. It\u2019s just my preference. And he dips sometimes. And I told him you\u2019re putting your money towards something that I\u2019m against so it\u2019s hard for me to be with somebody who does that. And he always says like he\u2019s sorry and he\u2019s not going to do it or whatever. And then like last night <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">I found a dip container and I said that this is like a big kick in the face to me and he said, well I do that. When I\u2019m stressed out that\u2019s what I do. And like he was putting it that I caused him emotional distress and that I\u2019ve never been easy to deal with. And I\u2019 like I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m emotional <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">at times but like you did this to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">I\u2019ve never been this unhappy except in this relationship. Like of course for me it\u2019s like ten-fold because I\u2019m so dramatic. But still like this whole cause is him. And I\u2019m just like \u2013 no, no, you don\u2019t push that in my face. He tries to use that against me. And it\u2019s like a mess and I forget. Like everything\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">so good and then I forget the issues we have when things are good. I thought I was like \u2013 10 months. He keeps saying that and it\u2019s not going to mean anything and I\u2019m like, yeah, it\u2019s going to mean something when you\u2019re on the street and not \u2013 it\u2019s going to mean something. And then he\u2019s just saying I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">mean. And I\u2019m not mean. I\u2019m being honest. I\u2019m being truthful, like I\u2019m telling you this is it. But he just kind of sits in his own mess and he doesn\u2019t like confrontation and he doesn\u2019t want to talk about problems like he\u2019ll totally ignore me which is \u2013 it just makes me angry. I don\u2019t feel sad anymore. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">I\u2019m just angry. I\u2019m like \u2018fine, be that way. If you want to have a pity party for yourself go ahead. I\u2019m not going to come to your rescue.\u2019 So that\u2019s how (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561092\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">But like it would probably ruin my whole day \u2013 this fight, to where I would do nothing before. I\u2019m just not letting it like it bothers me but I\u2019m going to still go on. I\u2019m going to study today, I\u2019m still going to go to school, still going to go to therapy. Like I would stop and not do anything and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">focus on the stupid little fight we\u2019re having.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel stronger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do. I\u2019m not going to let anybody control what happens. Like I was so stupid to do that before. That\u2019s what I feel like. He sort of made or broke my day. I was like \u2013 if I want things done I\u2019m going to do them for myself. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Like last week I said to you, like having <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">kept up with the housework and haven\u2019t been on him to help me and whatnot and it\u2019s because I just kind of gave up and I\u2019m like whatever. Like I don\u2019t like living in a mess, like it\u2019s a mess. And you know, I don\u2019t have to live in it. I can have the energy to clean it up. And like that\u2019s what I did yesterday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">spent the whole day cleaning the house and it makes me happy to like feel like I live in sanitary conditions. And then he\u2019s been sick. He has the flu or something so I\u2019m like even more reason I want to clean because it\u2019s disgusting. Like he has a bowl next to his bed from cereal like a week ago and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">it\u2019s like molded. I\u2019m like OCD, by any means, a clean-freak, but when it comes to sanitary and that\u2019s just a necessity to keep yourself like clean so you don\u2019t get sick and he doesn\u2019t care about that at all, like he would \u2013 like I said, doesn\u2019t even shower for like days and I have to tell him sometimes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D4\">like, \u2018please, shower for yourself.\u2019 And it\u2019s pathetic. Like I don\u2019t feel bad for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What do you want to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I\u2019m giving him 10 months because I need to, in a way. I\u2019m just doing for me \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Just directed towards other things like family and friends. Like I\u2019m just not doing things for him. Well, I\u2019m still doing things for him but I don\u2019t care what comes of it. That\u2019s me. Like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">nice. I\u2019m going to try my best but if nothing comes out of it I\u2019m not going to get so upset about it. I think that\u2019s the difference. And that really upset me this morning and I drove, listened to music and I was fine. I\u2019m just not going to let it control my life anymore and then I feel bad because, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">on the other hand, I have a cousin that\u2019s sick. I don\u2019t\u2019 know what his diagnosis is. I think he might be bipolar but he\u2019s struggled like throughout his life and is like an adult now. He\u2019s in his 30\u2019s and he has two kids and I didn\u2019t know the extent of his illness. He was always just a very charismatic, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">upbeat guy when he was around our family and he was like somebody that works out and cares about his physique and stuff. But I guess he was doing heroin and drugs and everything and I had no idea. I knew he had anger issues and he was having some trouble with the law but now he\u2019s in a psyche institute, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">like he\u2019s tried to kill himself and I don\u2019t want to get to that point. I want to be healthy mentally, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561092\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: How do you mean, you don\u2019t want to \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: I feel like if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, if you don\u2019t take responsibility for your actions, like that can help it \u2013 you can get into a cycle. Because he obviously doesn\u2019t care about himself and he doesn\u2019t care \u2013 he\u2019s just like in denial, I\u2019m sure. Like the drugs affect him and his reasoning. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">But when he\u2019s off drugs and he\u2019s on his medication he does good but he doesn\u2019t keep up with it. I feel like I\u2019m the same way, like when I\u2019m doing good and keep up with it and I just feel like you can impact your life like in good ways and bad ways. It\u2019s under your control. I didn\u2019t feel that way before. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">Like it was more like this is my life and like, \u2018poor me\u2019 and everything, but I can make a difference in my life, I can be happier. It\u2019s all on me. I can do this. I feel stronger and I\u2019m not going to let anyone ruin that for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">So what am I going to do? (Laughs) Take it day by day. Like some things are worth fighting for. Other things are not. And that\u2019s just \u2013 Steve thinks like, he doesn\u2019t like confrontation. He doesn\u2019t like to talk about things. It\u2019s never the right time to talk about things. That\u2019s him. That\u2019s fine. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">he\u2019s going to lose a good person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: When thinking about your cousin, do you think about Steve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: No. I think it\u2019s more that that psyche issue is that that psyche part runs in my family, you know? And I can see myself being self-destructive that way if I hit a low. Not like drugs or anything, but \u2013 Steve will always be Steve. There will always be someone who will take care of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What makes you say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I just think like women are more prone to do that, in that they want to nurture somebody and I just think that that\u2019s like \u2013 he\u2019ll always find somebody to take care of him. (Unclear) will take care of itself. I mean he is trying in some ways but it\u2019s like he\u2019ll help with the groceries <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">and he\u2019ll bring home little stuff but it\u2019s like it just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s enough. It doesn\u2019t fix anything. He really needs to like have an awakening or something for us to work. Like I love him and I want to see good things come to him. But he has got to do it on his own. And I just can\u2019t \u2013 I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">don\u2019t let understand how you can let someone take care of you financially and like not have something click in your brain like I have to do something different. Like he felt bad that I was out like some bucks out of my paycheck. But on the other hand he still said to me like \u2018oh, when is the cable going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F3\">to be back on?\u2019 Like really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Like he\u2019s your kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re the mom who\u2019s supposed to pay the bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: I\u2019m like it doesn\u2019t work that way. But on the other hand I can say that I can fully function on my own. I don\u2019t need anybody. I can support myself. But it\u2019s just aggravating. And he was like trying to explain himself and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be nice about this. Why should I be nice about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">this?\u2019 And that\u2019s like the worst insult that you can say to me especially because I\u2019m like doing the best I can. And I\u2019m like, if you want certain things you need to pay a little more and I felt like (unclear) that. But like the cell phone bill \u2013 he always goes over his, I don\u2019t know, gigabits or whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">and I always have to pay more. And he just doesn\u2019t take responsibility. He just thinks like it\u2019s okay and he says, \u2018oh, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Like \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019s going to fix this stuff \u2013 just saying you\u2019re sorry. But my plan is like either (unclear) cut out a lot of things out of the cable and he can\u2019t complain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200373\">about them. Because I don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s for him. And the phone bill like he can pay his own phone. I don\u2019t understand how I got into this role where I pay all the bills. I would be so much happier and there would be less stress. And he\u2019s already talking about Christmas and he like wants an X-box <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200374\">and I\u2019m like not buying you it. I\u2019m sorry. Like me, the old (unclear) would buy that for you but I\u2019m not buying that for you and like you have priorities like you have to fix your car. He\u2019s like, \u2018oh, I\u2019ll save up for it.\u2019 Oh \u2013 you can save up for an X-box but you can\u2019t pay the bills? It\u2019s I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200375\">I don\u2019t know how his mom did it. Now I can really understand how they wanted to push him out. So. Other than that, I\u2019m happy \u2013 not just feel better. It\u2019s not like the end of the world if we don\u2019t work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561092\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">And then I was talking with that other kid and you know \u2013 we have so much in common. Which is not the greatest thing. I\u2019m like \u2013 he is a great friend and I just want a friendship with him and he might want more but that\u2019s like, I\u2019m totally like that will never happen. Like I\u2019m in a relationship and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">like it\u2019s nice that we can come to each other about nursing stuff, that\u2019s nice. And he\u2019s so much like me, it\u2019s ridiculous \u2013 like it\u2019s a turn off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: He likes to talklike he talks so much. And like he grew up as like a heavier kid so he\u2019s like obsessed by his weight \u2013 really obsessed about his weight so he goes to the gym and everything and I\u2019m like I know what comes with that because I have my own problems there. And like he\u2019s like anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">about things and is a Type A personality or something like that, but on the other hand I see like I see in myself that are like negative qualities that he has those negative qualities and it\u2019s like sometimes so much the same person isn\u2019t the best thing, too. It\u2019s nice to have differences. And like Steve\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">so far left and like this kid is exactly like me. Like can\u2019t there be somebody in the middle?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s an interesting way of thinking about it but you know he\u2019s interested in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m not, by any means, that\u2019s not what I want. Like, I\u2019m a loyal person and I would never cheat. If I wanted to be with somebody else, I\u2019d be with somebody else. I like the fact that he can help me with school and that we have that \u2013 we can talk about nursing. Where I talk to Steve about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">education and he doesn\u2019t understand anything I\u2019m saying to him. So that\u2019s nice. And he helps me with school and I\u2019m kind of like trying to tell him what nursing really is because I work with him and I understand that he\u2019s in school but he doesn\u2019t thoroughly understand what my job\u2019s about, still. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be like, shock him, when he\u2019s an actual teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561092\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: What does he do? You work with him and what does he do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: He\u2019s like a student\/tech. He doesn\u2019t work a lot. He\u2019s like intermittent and they kind of have programs to get the nursing students in so they like eventually can have a job as a nurse there. It\u2019s hard to get in, so that\u2019s like a foot in the door. His work ethic isn\u2019t like mine as I think you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">really have to work hard as a teacher and it looks like he\u2019d be a better manager. I think a lot of people go into teaching because they know it\u2019s a job that\u2019s steady. You can pick up hours and it\u2019s reliable but it\u2019s really hard work and it\u2019s too bad when people just think of it as a job. So I\u2019m trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200452\">to prepare him. Who knows? Any feedback? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, part of it. I shared with you that it sounds like you feel stronger now. You feel better about it. You feel more distance from Steve and less dependent on him and less reliant on him. Are you wondering about feedback; that you\u2019re moving in the right direction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel you are. It sounds like you have the confidence. Are you looking for validation on that? Are you concerned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not concerned. It\u2019s just nice to be validated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well, I \u2013 I\u2019m taking it sounds like you feel better. I don\u2019t usually take the lead on that because I don\u2019t want to direct your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: No. I know. But you can pick up on patterns and would say if I go back and forth \u2013 I feel like I do sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: Back and forth in terms of your relationship with Steve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: And so is there a particular pattern that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: Like when everything\u2019s good it\u2019s good and I forget about all the negatives and then I\u2019m disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: For a while you\u2019ve been talking about the ways in which you\u2019re really questioning your relationship with Steve. You don\u2019t seem to be going back and forth very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: No. I just, I feel like we still can work but think we\u2019re definitely going to have to make that break where we\u2019re not living together. He\u2019s definitely going to have to prove to me that \u2013 I\u2019 don\u2019t want to have to say that to him but I think I need my space for a little bit. And if it\u2019s right <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">he\u2019ll figure it out, but in the living situation I just kind of like enabled him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: In terms of my opinion which I usually don\u2019t give, I do think ten months is a long time to be in a holding pattern. If you feel that being separate from him is going to sort of prove whether or not your relationship will be viable which sounds like it makes sense in many ways. You want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">see if he can take care of himself before you go back together. Ten months is a long time for that to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: But I take a long time to make my mind up about things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: So yeah, so what do you think will \u2013 do you think you\u2019ll change your mind in the ten months?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: (Cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: And what would make you change your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: I think if we connect better and if we have more like a romantic relationship if he tries harder to relate to me. He goes for a GED. He is more self-directed. Maybe he goes and works out so he\u2019s healthier because he\u2019s so tired. Like he doesn\u2019t take care of himself. If he starts taking care of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">himself then like things could be different.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561092\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like you\u2019re not waiting for you to feel anything differently, you\u2019re waiting for him to be different, then you\u2019ll feel differently about him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m waiting for him to like, yeah, come back to who he was, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen under these circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Probably not, but we\u2019re on a lease and I\u2019m not going to break that lease. I need his rent money so, financially it\u2019s what it is. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: I wonder, I mean \u2013 you can find a roommate. There are things you can do. I just wonder if there\u2019s more to it than just the practical. I understand you don\u2019t want to break the lease \u2013 that makes sense. But people break up all the time and find roommates and do all sorts of other things, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s something more to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, like I love him. I want to see us work. I do. And I don\u2019t see how \u2013 like I still have a little bit of hope left. What\u2019s ten months, though? How is that going to affect my life? I\u2019ve been with him like five years. I just have some hope that things will be different. Like maybe if I\u2019m a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">stronger person. Like obviously, financially I can\u2019t enable him anymore, but maybe he\u2019ll do something about that if I start taking away or I start distancing myself. It seemed to work like since I\u2019m not so available for him, he comes to me. Like I\u2019ve seen our fights \u2013 like I\u2019ll get upset and I\u2019ll walk <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200752\">away from him and he\u2019ll come down and try to like console me or talk to me where he wouldn\u2019t have before. And that\u2019s a change I have not seen with him for a while. So there\u2019s like little improvements. So maybe with time there will be more improvements. Because he does say that he wants the same things <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200753\">as me and I tell him he can\u2019t make promises and not go through with them, because then your word doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. You\u2019re giving me false hope, like he understands. Like he keeps telling me \u2013 like you just need to be patient with me. You just have to give me time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: It seems like there\u2019s these two very different Steves \u2013 like very different Steves. Like the Steve you\u2019re describing right now is not the Steve you were describing when you first came in \u2013 a different Steve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s \u2013 I never knew he was like that. When I first met him I thought he was clean and that he had a good work ethic. I had decided that I would not go out with him again because this was a pattern with him \u2013 if he didn\u2019t have a cell phone, he didn\u2019t have a car, didn\u2019t have a job \u2013 I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">not go out with him because as long as I\u2019ve known him he never had a job, he never could keep a job. And he had all those things and he was happy. He was working for this law office and he was making a lot of money. He was feeling good about himself but he lost his job, made the same mistakes and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200792\">feels bad for himself and doesn\u2019t do anything about it. And he is like two different people. He is very sweet and kind-hearted. But if you piss him off he can be so nasty and like \u2013 it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know \u2013 a totally different person. And I\u2019m like \u2013 that\u2019s what I said to him. I\u2019m like, \u2018there you go. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200793\">You think one way.\u2019 And he tries to tell me that I think one way.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018nope, \u2018I try to look at things from your perspective, too.\u2019 But he thinks my way is wrong. And I told him there\u2019s no right or wrong way and I\u2019m learning that in therapy. And it\u2019s like we need to come in to some sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200794\">agreement with each other. Like he calls it \u2013 he says to me, which really annoys me, is that I must be confused. You\u2019re not seeing things right. I\u2019m like \u2013 that\u2019s (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561092\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Confused about what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: Exactly. Like I\u2019m not understanding him. Or just because I don\u2019t agree with him he thinks I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m like, \u2018no, I\u2019m going to stay firm in how I feel. You\u2019re not going to change the way I feel. And he thinks I\u2019m confused. And I think that\u2019s wrong of him for saying that. It\u2019s kind of manipulative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: Before I like \u2013 whatever he said I believed. Like, oh you\u2019re being ridiculous. Or you\u2019re being this, you\u2019re being that. It\u2019s like I didn\u2019t have a voice. The things that I cared about were wrong. (Crying) I\u2019m like I\u2019m never going to be happy if I don\u2019t get what I want too \u2013 if I don\u2019t take care <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">of myself first. I\u2019m never going to be happy. Like I would \u2013 he asks me for money but I\u2019m like I pay the bills, like I don\u2019t have money to give to you. And he\u2019s like oh, I always feel like when I ask for money it\u2019s a bad thing. He\u2019ll like start being really nice to me and be like, hey can I ask you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200812\">a question? I think he\u2019s going to ask me about something nice, maybe like take me out, but then he asks me for money. And I\u2019m like \u2013 and he pays me back or whatever, but it\u2019s just the way he goes about doing it. It makes me feel really weird. It makes me feel used. Then he\u2019s like, \u2018you\u2019re (unclear). <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200813\">I\u2019m not trying to use you or whatever.\u2019 He like, \u2018when you ask me to borrow money or whatever I never hesitate.\u2019 I\u2019m like \u2013 \u2018I never ask you to borrow money. Why would I ask to borrow money? You have no money.\u2019 So it\u2019s like I don\u2019t if that\u2019s like his survive or whatnot. I don\u2019t know. I just \u2013 from my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200814\">point of view, I never try to put myself in a position where I have to borrow money. I try to keep my finances \u2013 like that\u2019s my responsibility. If I can\u2019t pay for something, then sacrifice for something else so I can pay my bills. He doesn\u2019t see it that way. And I could never imagine being married to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200815\">him and him like having like access to my account. Like I could never let him do it. I would never be able to trust him because of the decisions that he\u2019s made. That\u2019s a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a difficult position for you to be in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s just a weird situation. Like when you\u2019re young you don\u2019t \u2013 when you\u2019ve been together for a while you don\u2019t think of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: It seems on the one hand you\u2019re seeing it as really, really irresponsible and it seems like that\u2019s not really going to change, because what\u2019s going to change? He really doesn\u2019t have any more ambition to do things differently. He\u2019s still waiting for you to pay the cable bill. And on the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">hand it seems like you feel like he will and he wants to and he said he will. And it seems like those two Steves are very far apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: I know. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just like how I was raised. Like my father is so controlling of money, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s the responsible one. Like he\u2019ll pay all the bills and my mother is kind of \u2013 she likes to spend money and that\u2019s why my dad doesn\u2019t allow her to access the account because he <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200891\">doesn\u2019t trust her that she\u2019ll make the right decisions and she feels neglected but he feels like he\u2019s providing. And like I kind of feel like I\u2019m in the same situation like with somebody who\u2019s irresponsible so you can\u2019t trust them and you can\u2019t work together. But I don\u2019t know if he made more money than <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200892\">me like I feel like it would be a double standard \u2013 like then he would care for me and then that would be okay. And he would never not let me have access to funds. He\u2019s just not that person. If he had money, it would be different. And on the other hand, if he had more time than he has he\u2019d be a better <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200893\">boyfriend, a better person. His time\u2019s limited, it stinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561092\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems that you\u2019re not sure what to attribute to his personality versus circumstance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: I know he says that you\u2019re confused.
