But dialing and all kinds of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: [I realized after the fact and thought about it that I already knew that there was a problem with this appointment.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I\u2019m a little loopy because I haven\u2019t had heat for two days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh, no. And it\u2019s cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay. What are you going to do? It should be fixed today. I\u2019ve been using the burners on my stove off and on without overdoing it so I\u2019m sure I\u2019m breathing fumes or whatever. So I got good news from Assyria. I\u2019ll definitely be able to teach as many classes as I want.  I double-checked. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">I said, \u201cI\u2019m coming in March and I\u2019m looking for something before September. I\u2019m putting together the syllabus for the expository writing. I have ideas, as well, for other courses. I\u2019d really prefer to teach over two courses.\u201d She was like, \u201cYes. You can teach basically as many as you want,\u201d which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">huge because, depending on how often they meet, if I were to teach four classes, that\u2019s very well per month if I break it down.  Then she was really cool. She was like, \u201cSend me your CD again.\u201d She wrote an e-mail to the summer-session people and she copied me on it. She was like, \u201cBrian knows \u2013 \u201c She <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">mentioned the deans that I know. She was like, \u201cHe\u2019s coming here to teach in September, but I thought he would be a good fit since he is going to be here early.\u201d So that\u2019s good. That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s growing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been in contact with some other people as well about some other jobs. There is one job that I actually really want to get because it\u2019s perfect; but I haven\u2019t heard back yet and it\u2019s almost annoying because I know it\u2019s an absolutely perfect fit. I don\u2019t know what the deal is, but I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">to give it another couple of days and then just follow up.  It\u2019s an editor position of the magazine \u2013 I think it\u2019s a quarterly magazine \u2013 of the biggest Assyrian charity. It\u2019s great because they\u2019re like, \u201cWe prefer if you\u2019re in the capitol, but it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d which is great because that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">probably means I could be anywhere if I was traveling. And it\u2019s probably a salaried situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Like a part time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s a color magazine. I don\u2019t know. Obviously, it would be tough to do that and four classes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: And take four classes, yeah. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: But on the other hand, I could do that and teach two classes because that\u2019s salaried. It\u2019s a good gig.  And also because I could have that and be here in the summers. I would have an income. We\u2019ll see. It could also be a shitty job. I don\u2019t really know, but on the surface it seems like it would <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">be a good gig. Basically it seems like I don\u2019t have a lot to worry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: At least there is going to be teaching and potentially more than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) So that\u2019s good. The other thing I\u2019ve been having is that right now my roster right now (chuckles) is very full of these girls I\u2019ve been seeing. I\u2019m realizing now, and I think I was realizing it for quite a while, that I still don\u2019t let \u2013 I don\u2019t know.  I can\u2019t decide what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">it is. On the one hand, if I have a very high sex drive there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But on the other hand, (laughs) there is something wrong with it, kind of, if you\u2019re not sure why or . . . How should I put it? It feels like there is something wrong with it if a lot of times I don\u2019t want to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">it. Like on the one hand I met these girls and they\u2019re totally willing; and then most days I have no interest in seeing any of them.  Maybe that\u2019s another reason that Assyria will be good because the one thing I hadn\u2019t thought about is that in Assyria you can\u2019t do that as much. These girls live at home <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">with their parents. It\u2019s a different culture. Even if they\u2019re 30 or 40, they might be living there \u2013 especially women \u2013 do not live on their own. Men don\u2019t either. Regardless, even if they came to my place they have brothers. Over there you can\u2019t just be fucking around.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: More people that know your business and express their feelings about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Absolutely. It\u2019s still a big deal over there. There is still honor. Over there, that\u2019s respect to the family. It\u2019s got that kind of hot-blooded whatever type culture.  So in a way, that will be good because it won\u2019t be so easy. I won\u2019t be able to indulge that part of me that I feel like sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">. . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a limit put on you then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like a nice . . . Yeah, because this is almost too easy \u2013 it is too easy. It\u2019s like a kid in a candy store. You get all the toys you want, but then when you get them, you play with them a little bit and are like \u201cokay, I\u2019ve played with that truck. That\u2019s fine.\u201d (laughs) There is nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">deeper. But they don\u2019t see it that way. There is one who is really cool. We\u2019re very honest so I think she does get it, but the others don\u2019t really get it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Meaning that they think it\u2019s a relationship that\u2019s going to last?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Or they want it to be. I can never feel comfortable when I say \u201cno, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d I always feel this kind of \u2013 whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: What do you think you were looking for, getting into this \u2013 you keep calling it \u201croster?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I go through these phases where suddenly there will be like five women and I could see any one of them at any time; and then there will be periods where there is one or two. I don\u2019t know. I think it could be (pause) because I\u2019ve used sex so much as an escape, it\u2019s like a self-medicating thing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">I\u2019m going to do a big move and I feel like right now, like I\u2019ve been saying, things are good, but they also feel kind of unreal or whacky. So I think it\u2019s made me more hyper sexed-up or something just because it\u2019s like an outlet.  And that\u2019s okay, but within limits. You can\u2019t have like (chuckles) five <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">women who all want to see you all the time. It\u2019s taxing. It\u2019s like \u2013 and what? What are you doing? (pause) I don\u2019t know. I just think it\u2019s an odd thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Is it treating a kind of loneliness or despair state inside? And again, it\u2019s escape. Is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t feel like a despair thing. That\u2019s the thing I can\u2019t differentiate. A lot of it is perfectly healthy.  I just like it. On the other hand, I worry that because I\u2019m not getting other things done as much, that I\u2019m spending too much time. I\u2019m using it as a procrastinating <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Which makes it not healthy. Then it\u2019s a big kid in a candy shop. It isn\u2019t healthy to eat candy all day long. It\u2019s fine to have candy on occasion or for dessert, but after you\u2019ve had a good dinner. Is it more of an addiction then?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: I hope not. I hope not. It can\u2019t be because an addiction would be all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: No? I don\u2019t know.  I\u2019m not having sex with them every day, but it does take up part of the day with them texting me and going back and forth and things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: In other words, does it get in the way of your forward momentum on your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes, it probably does; in these kinds of phases especially. (pause) In that way, I think, again, Assyria just seems like good timing. I think it\u2019s just a natural limiter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it\u2019s kicking up right now and it may feel like it just ebbs and flows and sometimes it\u2019s out of your hands, but there\u2019s something about the fact that you\u2019re leaving soon that might make it \u2013 lots of women, lots of sex \u2013 again, knowing the end is coming, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s part of it, too. It\u2019s kind of like who gives a shit? A last hurrah, at least for the time being. I think there is a little bit of that. But even with those, after a week or two weeks you\u2019re like no, okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Even candy, you eat candy every day for a week and you want something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I think one thing that is true, and I just noticed this somewhere, I read it or someone was talking about it. I don\u2019t remember, but one thing I think that\u2019s true about me is that I\u2019m not really an extrovert, but I am in the sense that I really like human contact.  Like my friends, I love being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">with my friends. Two of them are so sweet. They were like, \u201cMan, when you go to Assyria \u2013 you\u2019re the one that kind of gets us all together. You make effort for us all to see each other.\u201d And I love that. I think that has something to do with it. I enjoy meeting a new person and talking to them. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">not just the sex in some ways, it\u2019s just that the sex, if it\u2019s such a high sex drive and they are like that, too, then that overtakes just hanging out. (pause) Or the sex and the expectations overtake. So a lot of times with these girls it would be great to just have a cup of coffee, but then they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D3\">going to think that because they want it to go a certain direction, I can\u2019t just relax and just meet a friend for a cup of coffee.  (pause) Because, for example, that week or two when I had my friends from out of town, I didn\u2019t really see any girls much. If I did, I just kept it very short and quick <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D4\">because I was just so happy hanging out with my friends, so I think there\u2019s an overlap there. I like to come home and be alone, but I have no problem if every day I saw my good friends and had coffee with them. I love that, which I\u2019m lucky to have here. Not every single day, but very often.  It seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D5\">like Assyria even more, I think, is that kind of culture. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It does seem though that with women it doesn\u2019t sound as much like the kind of \u2013 maybe it is this way but it doesn\u2019t feel like they respond in this way \u2013 the craving for human contact, being friends even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: It can be. I\u2019m sure sometimes I fuck it up, too, like they\u2019re okay with that but I think that they\u2019re not okay with it. I always have mixed feelings about that anyway. I think it\u2019s rare for men and women. It\u2019s not the same as just being with your buddies. I can be with them today and I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">kind of headachy and I feel discombobulated and I can just be like this.  I have very few women friends that I can do that with. Otherwise you can\u2019t help it. There is some underlying sexual attraction or tension or something. It\u2019s just like who needs it? That\u2019s not really being 100% comfortable and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">not giving a shit about whether I need to make out with her after this or can I just say \u201csee you later?\u201d There are all these things that I just don\u2019t subscribe to, I guess, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: I get what you\u2019re saying at one level. Of course it\u2019s different if it\u2019s hanging out with a buddy versus hanging out with a woman, but I think there\u2019s something more about not getting to be relaxed and being yourself with women period.  Like if you\u2019re in a relationship with her, sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">you\u2019re going to feel headachy \u2013 that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to feel and it\u2019s not going to be about sex at all that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve gotten better about that. I\u2019ve gotten better about that. And with my women friends \u2013 my real women friends \u2013 I am me. I\u2019ve changed so much, it\u2019s really nice. They\u2019re blown away. I\u2019m very honest and thoughtful and I say stuff that I wouldn\u2019t say before. I\u2019ve gotten better. With some of these <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">girls I\u2019m just telling them, \u201cListen, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m just really kind of out of it and things are really hectic and I\u2019m just not 100% there.\u201d That\u2019s pretty honest, but I don\u2019t want to have coffee with them because there\u2019s already . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s already been sexual?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Sexual and have coffee and do what now? They kind of want something; I can\u2019t really give it and so we\u2019re going to sit down and have coffee? I know what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m a little cut and dried that way and maybe a little (pause) . . . I\u2019m learning to be better and more open with women in general <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">maybe. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just saying that if you started off so sexually . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. Then it gets [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:45) after that. There is still something then right now that sounds like it\u2019s actually unclear what you want with them.

Do you want to get to know some of them? Do you want some of them to be friends? Do you want to never speak to them again? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: What I want is something that\u2019s not fair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Which is what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Unless they\u2019re totally okay with that which some of them, I guess, are. That when I really do feel like it that I can see them and have sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: With all of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, ideally I can see whichever one I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s what you want?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s kind of what it is. But here\u2019s the problem: even with the ones \u2013 there are at least two that are totally okay with that \u2013 (chuckles) the thing is that some weeks I don\u2019t want to. So then they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat the fuck? I thought that\u2019s what we were doing and now you don\u2019t?\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">not like scheduled. I don\u2019t feel like it right now. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: The part that sounds like it gets messy a little bit as you\u2019re saying \u201cyeah, that\u2019s what I want,\u201d is the part that is does this get in the way of what you want to do, in some way? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: On the one hand, it\u2019s awesome that I\u2019m even a lucky enough guy that has these fucking opportunities, but yeah, then it\u2019s like ehh, so? If I was doing that and then I\u2019m writing all day long, that\u2019s awesome and I think (chuckles) that\u2019s really where I want to get to. But that\u2019s not happening here <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">because I\u2019m already in this whole other fucked-up routine and I feel stuck and family and this and that. So I feel like that becomes instead of an added how-cool-that-I-get-to-do-this-if-I-want, it almost becomes a little bit like an added chore almost when I don\u2019t feel like it.  Do you know what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">saying? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m all headachy. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: No, no. I follow you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: In other words, what I\u2019m hoping that Assyria will kick-start is that if I feel more productive like, \u201cI took some good notes today. I got some writing done. My day was very productive,\u201d I have a feeling I\u2019ll feel fulfilled anyway and I won\u2019t need a roster of women to hang out with. Or I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">won\u2019t give a shit and it will just be fun. Then it really will be fun and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018No, I do want to see you.\u201d Whereas right now because there is so much on my mind, I\u2019m honestly just tired, especially if they\u2019re just for sex. Yeah, we can talk. They\u2019re very nice to talk to, but really? How often <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200752\">am I going to see them in the next six months.  It\u2019s a temporary situation so I\u2019m going to get together with them and talk about all this, my life? Does that make sense? Even that is like sex. That\u2019s another kind of intimacy. It\u2019s fucking tiring. Why would I when I can just chill out? Something like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200753\">that. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a complicated thing. (pause) It\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t having sex in Assyria, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be this easy; and I\u2019m glad. And on top of that, over there I do have to become friends with them.  Let\u2019s say there is one that I\u2019m totally lusting after, there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200754\">no way, unless they\u2019re unusual and promiscuous \u2013 that\u2019s just very rare over there \u2013 I have to be friends with them. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to spend time together \u2013 coffee. Maybe that\u2019s what I need. It just forces you to connect differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: I find myself thinking, and we haven\u2019t talked about this in a long time, I think it was a babysitter when you were a kid. That there have been these relationships in your history that were overly eroticized that shouldn\u2019t have been, that were eroticized too quickly, too soon, wrong place, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">wrong role. Maybe the impulse to the erotic . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: I was always like that. When I was a kid I remember \u2013 I think I told you this \u2013 at my grandmother\u2019s building where she lives now, but they had a bigger apartment with my grandfather, sometimes we\u2019d stay over there, which I loved. Their shower was so awesome because it would get so fucking hot. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">It\u2019s an apartment, so they\u2019re all cozy and warm. I don\u2019t remember how this would happen, but in their junk mail or whatever they would sometimes get either Victoria\u2019s Secret or one of those magazines. I remember being really young and taking that with me into the bathroom. I guess a lot of boys do that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200792\">but for me it was like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It raised interest?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I wanted to do that non-stop, like I was all about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Do you remember how old?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t. It was here, so it had to be when I was at least 12, 13, 14. That\u2019s fairly normal, but it was a really heightened interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: Again, masturbating, sexual interest . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: It would have been different if that\u2019s all I had. That\u2019s what all boys have, right? Their magazines and a flashlight; but I had actual experience when I was nine, ten, eleven. I had that cousin that would make out with me and stuff. She probably wasn\u2019t more than 14.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: And you were nine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: I think nine, ten, eleven. Maybe she was just a little younger. I think we\u2019re closer in age and she seemed much older, but I don\u2019t think she is. Regardless, let\u2019s say I was nine and she was 12. I don\u2019t know. Was I nine? Who the fuck knows. I wasn\u2019t 12, 13, or 14. I know that. I was younger. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200891\">And the thing is I liked it. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t like it, but I guess when I look back on it, that\u2019s weird. It wasn\u2019t just like a kiss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: A peck or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was making out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What was the context? No one else around?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: No, it started off \u2013 you know how kids play these games where you hide or whatever? One time I think we were hiding or something and she just did and I liked it. So then every chance we got, we would play games where we could separate and make out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: What was her personality like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: She was great. She\u2019s my third cousin. Really pretty and, actually \u2013 whoa. I\u2019m blowing my own mind now. You know what\u2019s fucking crazy? Wow. I\u2019m giving myself an earache I\u2019m blowing my mind so much. She was the oldest daughter of that family and the prettiest. Now I don\u2019t know if back then I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">like \u201cI want her,\u201d but when it happened I think a lot of times I couldn\u2019t believe it or later on I couldn\u2019t believe it because \u2013 her name is Betty \u2013 she was the prettiest. Wait a minute. Holy shit. I\u2019ve had a little moment here.  And then Tessa, who is the first girl that was a mutual, same age, more <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200952\">normal kind of 13, 14, 15, 16 years old, she was stunning, too. I had such a crush on her and I couldn\u2019t believe that she picked me. It was the same kind of thing. We\u2019d make out whenever we could. What\u2019s that game where boys and girls go in the closet? Spin the bottle, all those kinds of things. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200953\">it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s interesting. Now, in retrospect, they\u2019re all girls . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:42)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. These girls that would just appear. And I don\u2019t remember the babysitter at all, but of course my babysitter was a girl. That happens, too, right? I don\u2019t remember if she was attractive, but it didn\u2019t matter. She was the girl, babysitter, with her girl stuff.  When you\u2019re like six, seven, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">eight years old and this girl wants to hold you and likes you so much, you put them up here. Well, our work is done here. (both laugh) Wow, that\u2019s pretty good. That\u2019s interesting. I never fucking thought about that. From the get go it was almost like \u2013 well the babysitter out of that is not cool \u2013 but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200992\">the other two were too good and too much and too fast, especially if you\u2019re a kid who is not . . . If I was growing up all cocky and self-confident, who knows? That\u2019s neither here nor there, but I wasn\u2019t.  I was so shy and so alone in my own world that that kind of stuff was like what the fuck is happening? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200993\">Why are they . . ? Or even in North Carolina. This wasn\u2019t even sexual, but it was a woman. In North Carolina one time I got home from school and it was a nice spring day. I had my little cap with the tie thing. I was taking it off. I got my shit and I\u2019m walking and this man and woman approached me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Man and woman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: Man and woman. They stopped me and they said, \u201cAre you Assyrian?\u201d I was like \u201cyes.\u201d And the woman turned to the man and I think in Assyrian said, \u201cSee, I told you I could tell from his beautiful eyes.\u201d Oddly enough, they had been in that apartment building. They were looking for my parents. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\"> They were kind of lost and they saw me and they were like \u201cthat kid looks Assyrian.\u201d Even that, it\u2019s a little thing, but who knows? I don\u2019t remember if that woman was attractive. In my mind that\u2019s been my memory. There was this attractive older lady. I\u2019ve had a lot of weird \u2013 my second grade teacher, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D2\">who gave out free hugs every Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what that was about. I don\u2019t know. I liked it, but I don\u2019t know. I just remember something about on Fridays if we were all good she would give us a \u201cgood job\u201d hug or something. I don\u2019t fucking know. She was this blonde, busty, Southern woman. She was probably 22. (chuckles) I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">know. She seemed super old.  So who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Super old, but not old old, at 22?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: In my mind, as I got older I realized, \u201cWait a minute. she was probably like a 23-year-old girl.\u201d But that was second grade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: She was an adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. But I loved that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: She would hug everyone in the class?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, in class. I think when we were leaving or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Like a good-bye hug?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Something like that. It was awesome, but in retrospect, this beautiful woman or this womanly adult is giving you this attention and affection. If you have a weird relationship with your mom, then these other females \u2013 it\u2019s like a cluster fuck, good and bad. Yeah. Something like that. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">was awesome, but in retrospect, this beautiful woman or this womanly adult is giving you this attention and affection. If you have a weird relationship with your mom, then these other females \u2013 it\u2019s like a cluster fuck, good and bad in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny that you have this mother then who is smothering and critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: Who, on the one hand, did give me a lot of attention, kissing and hugging, but I didn\u2019t want it. I mean I wanted it and I didn\u2019t want it because of this other weird shit that bothered me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: At home, then, it became this kind of negative chronic living with someone whose contact was smothering and aversive. But her hug became the moment of joy on Friday and then leaving again and she\u2019s just your teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: And also because those things felt so unconditional. \u201cI just want to make out with you\u201d or \u201ccome in the closet with me because you\u2019re so cute\u201d or :I want to hug you goodbye.\u201d It\u2019s just \u201cI like you;\u201d whereas if you have a mom that\u2019s \u201cI like you, but why are you wearing those shoes?\u201d  (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">Yesterday I said, \u201cMa, I got this good news from Assyria that I will totally be able to teach. I\u2019d be making like $4,000 a month if I do four classes. In Assyria? Are you kidding me?\u201d She was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s great.\u201d But then (laughing) she goes, \u201cWell, I mean, yeah. That\u2019s what you should make.\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B92\">I got kind of annoyed and I just kind of laughed. I was like, \u201cWell, right. It is what I should make, but the point is I\u2019m going to make it because I created this opportunity for myself.\u201d (laughs) So that\u2019s kind of cool. It\u2019s hard to find jobs. And then she said, \u201cNo, no.\u201d She got all frustrated. \u201cI <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B93\">didn\u2019t mean anything. Of course it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d  But it\u2019s like big whoop; that\u2019s what you should be making. And I get what she\u2019s saying. She was like, \u201cYou know you\u2019ve had all this education and you\u2019ve struggled. You\u2019ve stuck to it so, of course, they should be paying you that.\u201d And I get that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B94\">That\u2019s very sweet. She just has such a history of . . . If someone else said that I would be like, \u201cHell, yeah.

You know I realized this yesterday, I actually do feel kind of bad. I think there are times when she doesn\u2019t mean it, but with the history it\u2019s just a program. It\u2019s her style, too. Sometimes she says things and they\u2019re all very like \u201cehh.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C11\"> So they can be excited and they still would be like hmm-hahh. Her tone is just annoying a little bit, but it\u2019s not like saying \u201cthose are cool shoes; why do you have acne?\u201d (laughing) Do you know what I mean? It wasn\u2019t that, but in the past and up to recently still, there are a lot of give with one <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C12\">hand and take away with the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">THERAPIST: And even her tone, as much as it could just be that it\u2019s her style and you know if she means it, it still matters.

It almost annoys me for them that they can\u2019t be excited.  They won\u2019t let themselves be truly excited about anything. \u201cIt\u2019s such a nice day out.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s going to snow tomorrow.\u201d Like everything has a . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: You can feel that now about her, but as a kid the effect is done to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a fucking nightmare because it\u2019s like (chuckling) being stroked and smacked at the same time. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">THERAPIST: \u201cStroked and smacked.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like you\u2019re kind of patting someone on the shoulder and then punching them (chuckling) in the arm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: I get it, I just think that comment is so much of the basis of what so many relationships have been like \u2013 stroked and smacked. Like falling for someone who is also not going to be there and is so aloof that she\u2019ll pull back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: I see. Right. It\u2019s been good that that hasn\u2019t happened recently. I\u2019ve stopped that, but now I\u2019m in this weird limbo where it\u2019s getting better but now it\u2019s about really trying to connect with people and trying to not have sex. This is the other thing, some of it \u2013 I\u2019m not annoyed because it sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D11\">like I\u2019m complaining about women wanting to have sex with me \u2013 but I\u2019ve been on dates recently, with this group of women, where a few of them I absolutely did not expect even maybe making out.  I was like, \u201cThis person seems not like that.\u201d And each fucking one of them, there was either serious making <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D12\">out with hands and pants and whatever the fuck other things or there was literally sex. That\u2019s not right, I think. (chuckles) It\u2019s awesome, but then for a guy like me I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good because I already have trust issues and this and that. You start thinking, \u201cWhat is going on here? These <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D13\">are professional, very together, not sleazy, not slutty women. But then what does this mean? You don\u2019t fucking know me. How charming could I possibly be?\u201d And then your mind says, \u201cWell, obviously, I\u2019m not the only charming person in the world, so do they do this?\u201d  They all adamantly claim \u201cI don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D14\">know what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t do this.\u201d I take the law of averages and maybe that\u2019s true for half of them or whatever, so it\u2019s like what is going on here? Then your mind starts thinking \u201care we all fucked up? What are we doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Even if it\u2019s true for only half, I think that\u2019s still leaving you puzzled, like what is that then when women who would not ordinarily do this are doing it? What do I do with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what to do with it because I\u2019m not in love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And if anything you might wish that they wouldn\u2019t do that, actually, because then it becomes something less special. It\u2019s something to wait and explore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">CLIENT: Right. But once you do that off the bat, it\u2019s done. Yeah. It\u2019s a sex buddy. I think to most guys, that\u2019s what it becomes.  Unless it\u2019s a very rare Samantha type where you really are really, really \u2013 because it can happen if it\u2019s passionate and really romantic. You\u2019ve had an amazing date and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D91\">you just really feel connected. I guess it\u2019s possible. But you don\u2019t know this person at all. (pause) No, I totally don\u2019t know what to do with that at all. It\u2019s very strange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">THERAPIST: What do you make of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, Claire. I have really sat down and thought about this. I get it. I\u2019m a confident guy now, more or less. I feel very comfortable in my skin. I know that I\u2019m a kind of interesting dude, but honestly (chuckling) there are lots of interesting people.  There are attractive people. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD1\">if they\u2019re not doing this all the time or let\u2019s say they do do it once in a while, even that, what is that? What is it that I and whoever else they\u2019re doing it with, what is it invoking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Why are they really drawn to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, to that point. They want to follow me to my house and have sex. What the fuck? (pause) I\u2019m a dude so it\u2019s very hard to say no to. It\u2019s such a turn-on, obviously, on some level. Some stranger is going crazy for you. On the other hand, I think it just proves my point that on a bigger scale, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E11\">something is not right. Something is rotten in Denmark. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny that you see that as becoming this negative thing, though. There is nothing that you internalize about it then that maybe there is something about you that is alluring to people or attractive. Why is that something fucked up in Denmark?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E5\">CLIENT: Claire, come on, man. Isn\u2019t it? What I\u2019m saying is you\u2019re telling me that not one of these girls could just take a breath \u2013 I\u2019m that irresistible? They can\u2019t just take a breath and be like \u201cI really like this guy. Do I really want to give him a blow job in the car right now? Yeah, I think I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E51\">do.\u201d Of course I\u2019m not going to say no. That\u2019s fucking hot, but what is that? I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m saying that if it happened once in a while, I get it. Some people just want to have sex. It is just a hook-up.  I get it. But with a lot of these chicks it\u2019s not just a hook-up, obviously. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E52\">They want to give me a blow job in the car, but then they want to have coffee, they want to go to the museum, they want me to meet their friends; so that\u2019s what I don\u2019t get. Of course, I\u2019m totally cool with going to the bar. I meet somebody; it\u2019s all great. We have sex and that\u2019s exactly what it is. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E53\">That\u2019s never the case. I\u2019ve never once had a case where a woman is like, \u201cThat was awesome. Here\u2019s my number. Use it if you want. Whatever. It would be cool to see you sometime again.\u201d Never. It\u2019s always like a \u201cthing.\u201d No? Is that not weird?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E7\">THERAPIST: You mean where it doesn\u2019t lead to something more physical?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just saying take me out of the equation. Isn\u2019t that odd if this is a common thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">CLIENT: Or are you saying it\u2019s not a common thing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m just saying what feels odd as you\u2019re talking about it is that it\u2019s as though it\u2019s not internalized that people could be drawn to you. You\u2019ve had phases where you feel like \u201cwhy is no one looking at my image?\u201d And you can get really despairing about no one being attracted to you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF1\">so it still feels sort of like there is a split, somehow, internally about knowing yourself, just confidently knowing. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">CLIENT: Kind of, but I feel like I do know. More and more and more I do. Even those times when I\u2019ve said \u201cwhy isn\u2019t?\u201d more and more I\u2019ve gotten to the point where it\u2019s just a voice and because it\u2019s such an old voice, it just pops up and I\u2019ll be like \u201call right, calm down.\u201d It is still there a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F11\">bit. It is. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m still not completely at a place where I\u2019m like \u201cI published the book.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Or \u201chot women are attracted to me.\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">CLIENT: On the other hand, I do get it more and more. I do understand that. Honestly. I do feel way more comfortable. When I wake up I\u2019m like \u201cHey, man. You look all right. I like it.\u201d Again, I\u2019m just saying that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Why they have a kind of fever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t seem healthy to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">THERAPIST: For them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yes. If something is supposed to be something after that, is that the way to get things started? And I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m thinking about it too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">THERAPIST: No, no, no. I agree. It\u2019s not. It doesn\u2019t usually lead anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">CLIENT: Okay, well that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Once in a while, of course, I get it. We\u2019ve all been there. You\u2019re just really attracted to somebody and you just want to have sex with them and they want to have sex with you.  I\u2019m just saying that where you\u2019re setting up a date with someone and you want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201011\">go to the movies and you think, \u201cOh, cool. We\u2019ll go to the movies. This chick seems like . . .\u201d Especially one of them. I wasn\u2019t even sure if there was going to be any kissing at the end of the date. I was like, \u201cAll right. We\u2019re going to go have some wine after this and whatever.\u201d And that\u2019s not because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201012\">I didn\u2019t think she wasn\u2019t attracted to me, I just thought this seemed like the kind of woman where . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562580\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20103\">THERAPIST: Who would wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20107\">THERAPIST: You could wait, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20109\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s a whole other story.
