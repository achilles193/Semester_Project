Now I need all of the real answers! The more introspective answers, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Uh... yeah, this past week has been a whole lot of entertaining, and travelling around, and seeing a lot of things, playing tour guide, and... (clears throat) And I was just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: How connected did you feel to your guests? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Fairly. (pause) Yeah, I have to say fairly. I actually, I enjoyed... My friends drove here from Portland, and they were here... here, so it was like, a week ago Sunday till Wednesday, then they rode down to DC. Then... Julie and I took the, drove to Hamden and took the train down on Thursday. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">We were there until Saturday. We were planning on staying until Sunday, but it was just... They left Saturday, so we were going to be there an extra day. And we found out that... some friends of ours, also from Portland, happened to be in town. So we got to see them on Saturday. After that, another <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">set of friends, we went to see on Saturday and we were set up to leave Saturday evening, because we were just too... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Too wiped out! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Spent, yeah. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of catching up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It is. It\u2019s a lot of face time, but you know, normally I would never, ever, ever schedule that amount of social, you know, engagements in the course of 24 hours, but it was actually really surprisingly good. I enjoyed...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I mean, it\u2019s... because it\u2019s, these are the people who (sighs) who I think about when I think about who I want to see, and the friends that I want to be with these people, so... (sighs) Yeah. That was... that was nice. But, you know, Saturday night getting home at 10:30 or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">like that, it just like, it was just draining. Yesterday was really hard, because Julie and I were both very low, very... (pause) Neither one of us could pull each other out and... both hurting, and both very sensitive, and emotional. And (sighs)... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(pause) So I went to the gym. We were both supposed to go, but... I kind of begged her to go, because you know, I figured it would be good for both of us. That was the plan. (pause) She had this answer of, \u201cNo, I just want to stay in bed forever.\u201d (chuckles) I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to the gym.\u201d So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">I went and I... got groceries and came back and I was in a better place. I think she was in a better place, so that was kind of... Because we hadn\u2019t been to the gym in a week, you know, so it was like, I knew the amount of stress that I was encountering each day... entertaining, feeding... hosting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">Brittany (ph) also staying with us for the (inaudible)... and just being in DC, of all places (sighs), which I really don\u2019t like, but... I feel... I don\u2019t know what the experience is, but it\u2019s the kind of thing where you look forward to something, but then when it\u2019s over, you\u2019re really happy it\u2019s over, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">you know? (chuckles) It\u2019s like, you kind of have your life back and you don\u2019t have something that\u2019s just like... looming in the future or... that you know is going to test you a bit, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561869\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I mean, it sounds like it was good to see, it was good to spend time with the people, but there were some challenges to scheduling (client affirms) and travelling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: And just the environment and... So, anyway, it was... it was good. And I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over. And... (pause) Yeah, I just... kind of just getting back into my head on some things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Do you need to be in your head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, what I mean by that is, I\u2019m just kind of getting back to the things that I want to work on, and I store them in my head, I think. (chuckles) (pause) And because my dad\u2019s birthday is coming up in a week, and you know, I had hoped to have this letter written and sent off by my birthday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">then by his birthday and then (sighs)... Yeah, so... But, you know... (pause) Something that I\u2019ve been thinking about off and on the past couple of weeks is, you know... I think I\u2019ve tended to look at the circumstances in my life negatively, as like, \u201cThis happened to me, I\u2019m a victim of this or that...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Feeling passive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And... sure, all of those things happened and, sure, I can attribute... certain, what I would consider negative outcomes as a result (chuckles), which we\u2019ve discussed for the past few years. And, you know, I think about... (chuckles) \u201cnormal people,\u201d if there is such a thing. If there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">are people who don\u2019t experience sexual abuse in their families, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: They don\u2019t ex ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: The majority of people don\u2019t experience sexual abuse in their families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Really? Okay. Well, great. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: But there is reason, normal people and normal experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Uh-hmm, yeah. I guess what I mean is... (sighs) Everyone has their own trauma, right? I mean, I don\u2019t necessarily believe that... that every person experiences some sort of hell in their life. I don\u2019t necessarily believe that. At the same time, is that hell that we experience at some point in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">our lives what makes us interesting, what makes us stronger, what makes us... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It can be, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: ...you know, creative. It makes us... And, you know, if we never experienced... I mean, if I never experienced... shame, guilt, and years and years of repression, all of that... would I be the person I am today? And I guess I say that with a grin, because it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, God, I would hope <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">not,\u201d because this is kind of a miserable time I\u2019ve had! (pause) But what\u2019s the alternative? Would I be some boring person who fits the, you know... footprint of every other 6\u20192\u201d person in this country? I don\u2019t know, but... but what can I point to and say, \u201cWell, these things about me here, that I like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">those things may have come from that struggle.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think... we\u2019ll never know, obviously, you know, what\u2019s the result of what would you, how would you be different if you hadn\u2019t had those particular traumas. But I think we can look at, you know, the things you have to express, and the way you have to express them are of value. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">know, your songs, your stories, the perspective that you bring to other people\u2019s stories. You know like, on your website, the... It\u2019s... Absolutely your perspective is impacted by the experiences you have, good and bad experiences (client affirms), not just things that feel traumatic, but also, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">know, other things that you\u2019ve experienced in your life. You know, a win at little league baseball, who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561869\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay. (chuckles) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: But, yeah, I mean there are a lot that you bring, and it\u2019s all, somehow a result of accumulated experience and the ways that you\u2019ve chosen to respond to them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that seems like it\u2019s a process more of a statement, you know, responding to it. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I think that\u2019s what your, that\u2019s a lot of what your therapy work is, is you\u2019re dealing, deciding to respond to it a way that\u2019s more adaptive (client affirms), for you and if other people benefit from that, great, but... I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, slowly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: But, yeah. Well, I think rightly so, primarily about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess an extension of all this thought is... I think for a while I tried to think of the good things that... that my dad did for me. And I\u2019m hard pressed to find a lot, I really am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: The good things may not come from dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: And they might be overshadowed by the negative things. You know, just too... too small, and paling in comparison to what... to the negative things. That said... and I don\u2019t want to say, \u201cGee, thanks Dad, for making me so screwed up that I\u2019m, you know, I\u2019m writing a melody,\u201d (chuckles), you know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">Because, again, you cannot attribute that to that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">Um... but (sighs), is there a way to celebrate who I am... as opposed to... lament who I am, because of what has happened to me, you know, because what\u2019s happened to me, I can try to wear that as some sort of cape, you know? And say, \u201cLook at me, look at what happened to me.\u201d But I don\u2019t want everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">to be cast in the reflection of that, you know? That\u2019s, everything has to be viewed with the... you know... (sighs) I don\u2019t know... the handicap of that, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Being able to incorporate those things as a part of your life, rather than your life as a reaction to those things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah... (pause) And I guess that\u2019s a more... perhaps constructive approach, but at the same time... (pause) It\u2019s like, I just want to disown them, you know, and just deal with them and then cast them aside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: And be done with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, as opposed to having to be a part of my life, you know. (chuckles) And be done with it, yes like, everything that I hope to do is just one off\u2019s: just go to the gym once, and I\u2019m good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m not sure you can excise them completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll take your word for it. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: But... and I think, but you can package them up neatly, so they don\u2019t need to be cumbersome. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah? (sighs) Okay. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure I must have shared my baggage... airport scenario with you at some point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: It sounds familiar, but please... I must need it again. (both chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: So, often, you know, people talk about carrying their baggage around with them. I\u2019ve used that sort of phrase to think about, well like, I don\u2019t think we can necessarily excise, you know, experiences in our life, and then never deal with them again, or not notice how they maybe impact us. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">But I think, maybe a possibility is thinking about kind of these experiences of your life, that you maybe wish you hadn\u2019t had: you package them up nicely in a rolling suitcase that\u2019s easy to carry around with you, and store it somewhere, and lock the cabinet in the airport, which is different than... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200792\">avoidance or denial, because you know it\u2019s there. To me, the idea of, you know, packaging it up nicely into your rolling suitcase is that you\u2019ve processed it. You know, you haven\u2019t said, \u201cI\u2019m not looking at that. It\u2019s scary. I\u2019m going to stick my head in the sand.\u201d You\u2019ve said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s there, it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200793\">happened to me, I\u2019ve looked at it, I understand it. This is how I\u2019m coping with it. I\u2019m putting it over there, where it doesn\u2019t get in my way anymore.\u201d And you go on, about your life. That\u2019s my visual (chuckles) for some of the work that we do in here. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561869\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: And the airline can\u2019t just lose it for you, you know, like they do?

Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: I think you want to be in control, you decide where you put it. Is it in some, you know, locker somewhere?

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well... I guess what I, what I thought of, when you were talking that was how, for so long, I\u2019ve been identified by my baggage. I\u2019ve identified myself by my baggage. Like, \u201cThat baggage\u2014I belong to it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Right! So that\u2019s like, carrying it around with you, forgetting to stow it some place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Or having it carry me around, you know, and drag me around and... (clears throat) and to wear the clothes in that bag, which is to say, you know, \u201cThis is, this is the mess that I am and I\u2019m going to... put it front of you, so that it\u2019s unmistakable that I\u2019ve suffered,\u201d or whatever, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">And I don\u2019t think I do that, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">I do think... it has been in the forefront of my mind as a filter through which I try to understand things. Like, \u201cWhy am I such and such a way, why am I this, why am I that?\u201d That helps, sure. (clears throat) But I think it helps explain things as they are, as opposed to me controlling the way I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">things to be. You know, on the way over here, I just picked up this prep kit for my colonoscopy (chuckles) next Monday, my second one. I\u2019m really looking forward to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">And, you know, for a second it made me wonder, you know, because my sister was diagnosed with colon cancer five years ago. I\u2019ve had one... they said, check back in three years. Well, it\u2019s been five years. Anyway, so I thought to myself, \u201cWell, what if they find something? What will I do then? What would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">I do?\u201d Would I say... \u201cOkay, you know what? Screw this; I\u2019m tired of living under the shadow of shame, guilt, and I can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m just flawed.\u201d Or will I say, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve only got five months, say, five years to live...,\u201d perhaps, you know. Or what will be the impact <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">of such a diagnosis? Will it, you know, spur me to act in a way that I want to act, or is it... what would it do? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: What would be different, if you were spurred to act the way you want to act? What would that... be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s, I haven\u2019t thought about that one yet. It was just a short one (inaudible) (therapist chuckles) And that\u2019s a good question. Maybe that\u2019s something that requires some decent reflection, because... you know, there is that, and then there is the, \u201cWhy am I not doing this now?\u201d question <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561869\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, once you figure out what you want to do, you can do it before, without having to wait for some scary diagnosis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Well, yeah. That\u2019s what I mean. It\u2019s like, well, what, you know, if these are the things that I would do, had I, you know, been diagnosed with cancer or something... fine. Then but why am I not doing those now? And (sighs)... it\u2019s hard to say, because I, you know, I can\u2019t even think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">of how I would... I mean, I think I am doing things differently now than I maybe would have five years ago, but what (sighs) holds me back now, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I am being held back. So I guess I\u2019ll have to... perhaps, you know, mull that over a bit (sighs) and try to... see if there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">a different way of living that I would have... I mean, honestly I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be with my wife. I don\u2019t know. I think it depends on my...

(pause) I just sometimes think she can do better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">(pause 00:20:00 to 00:20:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting that your answer is all about her... and not about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: (pause) I think the thought that I don\u2019t love her scares me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: (pause) Was there a time when you didn\u2019t doubt that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: (pause) (sighs) It\u2019s been awhile. (pause) I don\u2019t know how long, or when it was, but... I do wonder if I loved me, would I love her? I assume that to be true. (pause) If I don\u2019t love me, why would someone else? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Well, they might not be carrying around the same sense of shame. I mean, I think what gets in the way of you feeling loving towards yourself is the shame that you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I understand how, you know, going to a massage place for... the wonder of what could happen doesn\u2019t necessarily alleviate that shame. It just seems to compound it. And (sighs)... you know, the things, whatever it is. (pause) (sighs) Not doing things that I know are good for me. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">doesn\u2019t necessarily compound it, but it doesn\u2019t... it doesn\u2019t relieve me at all. (pause) (sighs) I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: (sound of cracking knuckles) Sorry; bad habit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: That\u2019s all right. I do it too. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard you do it! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m usually good about not doing it during a session (ph).

(pause) I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m kind of lost right now. Must be that knuckle crack. (chuckles) No, I don\u2019t, I (sighs)... (pause) Perhaps the expectations that I put on loving me are too much. Maybe it\u2019s that... I can\u2019t love <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">myself unless I walk this straight and narrow path.

Can you love your imperfect self, because you\u2019re not ever going to be perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not going to come back here again! (both chuckle) No, yeah, and I think that\u2019s part of what I was alluding to earlier with the, you know... who I am as a result of my experiences. (pause) What else can I bargain for, you know? I mean (chuckles) I don\u2019t have a choice. I mean, and that\u2019s who <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">I am. I\u2019m shaped this way, carved that way, and love it or leave it, that\u2019s who I am. Can I view that as something lovable, as opposed to something... you know (clears throat) condemnable, you know? And something which... seems to dwell on its own imperfection in order to... be unlovable or something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B72\">I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: So, it\u2019s interesting that, as you talk, you equate your experiences to you. Like, just the hist , your history of experiences, or the sum total of your experiences; is that the same thing as who you are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: (pause) (chuckles) No, it\u2019s what I haven\u2019t done, that\u2019s who I am.

You know, we talked about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: That seems unfair to, they both seem unfair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, and they\u2019re (chuckles)... It\u2019s kind of one of those battles you just can\u2019t win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so I wonder, I mean, is there a way to define you that\u2019s not... not just about what you\u2019ve done or haven\u2019t done. I mean, those are your, what you have and haven\u2019t done are experiences, but that\u2019s not necessarily who you are. Like, there is some human essence that\u2019s undefined. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">(client clears throat and affirms) But it seems like who a person is seems more complicated than a list of their, you know, their life\u2019s resume. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But the funny thing is, it\u2019s not the life\u2019s resume, it\u2019s just the life\u2019s... you know... bad things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s not, you\u2019re not even...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not the good things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: For some reason, you\u2019re not accounting for the other stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s like, it doesn\u2019t matter, because there is all this other stuff.

Yeah, I picked some of that up, actually. (chuckles) I think you were telling me that you were at somebody\u2019s house and they had a cat or something. You were trying to, eye drops to your child and they had contacts, is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Well, I have contacts. My child also has my allergies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Oh, lovely. Wow! Yeah, I\u2019m allergic to a lot of cats myself, but not all of them. Anyway... (chuckles) My aunts love (ph) cats. Well I don\u2019t have to be part of your intake. (therapist chuckles) \u201cDo you have cats? Sorry, I\u2019m not accepting new patients!\u201d (both chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">Yeah, I guess (sighs)... (sighs) You know, it\u2019s just a... I guess if I could summarize this struggle, it would be... believing that I can be lovable and accept myself on a fundamental level that doesn\u2019t depend upon what I\u2019ve done, or what\u2019s happened to me, or what I think about doing, and to continually <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">maintain activities that reinforce that. And... so it\u2019s a belief system, it\u2019s an act-based, if I can use that word... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561869\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Behaviorally based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah, what you said. (chuckles) And maybe that\u2019s just it. Maybe it\u2019s those two things that, together if maintained, can be a way that I would want to live if I were given a five-year death sentence, or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: When you watch a movie, or read a book, or read a human-interest story; how do you determine whether or not the subject, the character, is good or bad, lovable or unlovable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: (pause) Usually it\u2019s a sense of humor. (pause) I mean, you look at somebody like... for example... The Great (sic) Lebowski. Have you seen that? (therapist affirms) A complete waste, right? I mean, (chuckles) not to be judgmental, but doesn\u2019t have a lot... but, I mean, he\u2019s lovable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: (pause) So what stops you from giving yourself the same... compassion?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: (sighs) (pause) I guess that is the question. I don\u2019t know. (pause) I think the paths to fantasy and escape are so well worn, so slippery, greased in fact, that... I think my mind dwells more in the fantasy and the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d than the... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: What is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: What is or what... could be.

It\u2019s a nicer way of saying it. I could do this, and then I\u2019d be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, what I mean to say is... putting my energies toward something that\u2019s constructive, as opposed to something that\u2019s destructive. When I say, \u201ccould be,\u201d like, \u201cI could go to the gym. I could pick up the guitar and just noodle,\u201d you know? That\u2019s what I mean by \u201ccould be.\u201d I mean, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">that is, but it\u2019s not necessarily guaranteed is, because I can easily say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to the gym today. I\u2019m just going to eat ice cream all day.\u201d I mean, that would suck, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: But your value as a person doesn\u2019t necessarily change.

I think I did do that, or I have done it a couple of times. When I went to that massage place and was assisted, basically and I didn\u2019t... catastrophize that. Normally I would.

You don\u2019t necessarily have to approve of every decision you make, but that doesn\u2019t, when you make a decision or do something that you disapprove of, that doesn\u2019t have to mean that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">you remove your acceptance of the person. Have you heard the term \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d? (pause) All right. So it, the idea... that term actually comes from humanistic therapy, this guy Rogers, I believe. I hope I\u2019m right for the grad students listening. (both chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Oh boy! Grad students!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: But the idea is that a therapist should hold unconditional positive regard for their clients. If you can\u2019t do that, how can someone possibly really feel safe to talk about whatever it is they need to talk about, how could someone grow and change in an environment where they\u2019re not being consistently <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">supported for who they are? That does not need to mean that the therapist... reinforces, condones, or accepts every single behavior that a client might have, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">So, I mean, if you came in here, what you really wanted to do is stop smoking, me saying like, \u201cGreat! You had five packs of cigarettes this week? That\u2019s awesome!\u201d That\u2019s not necessarily going to be helpful. However, at the same time that I might not encourage the behavior, I could still encourage and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">accept you for the struggle that you\u2019re going through, for the person that you are. I think the same thing about how you feel about yourself. Finding a way to separate... judgment of behavior from judgment of the person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">You judge yourself based on your behavior, as a good or bad person. That\u2019s what shame is. \u201cI\u2019m a bad person because I did X or because I thought X.\u201d Being able to separate that and say, \u201cI\u2019m a good person with value. I like who I am. I dislike that choice I made,\u201d but they are separate. (client affirms) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201211\">It can be tricky to practice that, and figure out how to separate judging the behavior from judging the person. But I think it\u2019s very doable. (client affirms) It\u2019s probably something your par , dad (I haven\u2019t heard much about mom\u2019s parenting), but I don\u2019t think dad got it very well, because it sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201212\">like you often felt judged. It didn\u2019t sound like you felt, as a kid, that you had that sense of unconditional positive regard from a parent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think so. (pause) I just had a thought I wanted to go on. I\u2019m trying to... cling to it. (pause) Oh, well. (pause) Yeah. (sighs) I guess I just... (chuckles) I sometimes wonder if... (pause) if everyone else basically just assumes that I\u2019m going to thrive, except me. Am I the only <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">one standing in my way? Probably. And this unconditional positive regard... (chuckles) that\u2019s just like... I don\u2019t know, some sort of triple oxymoron or something (chuckles) in my... situation. But (sighs)... yeah, I don\u2019t know. I can understand...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20122-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20122-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561869\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: You place a lot of conditions on how you regard yourself. (client affirms) Tons of them. (client affirms) High ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: High, impossible ones, impossible and meaningless, basically. But I don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to have to try to... to work on that idea of accepting a person, despite the behavior. (pause) (chuckles) It\u2019s kind of like when I think of is like foreigners saying, \u201cWe love Americans, we just hate your government, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201271\">what you do,\u201d you know. And maybe that\u2019s... not it, but... (sighs) (pause) But I\u2019m going to have to try. I want to try to... embrace that... that mindset, because there are circumstances for everything. To understand the circumstances is kind of beside the point, right? I mean it doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201272\">to say, \u201cWell, I can accept this because I am trying to escape right now and that\u2019s a normal reaction to this.\u201d Well, you know... yeah, that\u2019s important, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah, understanding is a piece, but it\u2019s not everything and it doesn\u2019t need to be. (client affirms) It doesn\u2019t need to be part of everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think I drive that too much. I think I drive for sense, an explanation, or a reason... as an answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">(pause 00:42:26 to 00:43:09)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">You know what I said earlier about... not everyone having sexual abuse happen in their family? (pause) (sighs) Do you have a philosophy or even a... a comprehension of... You have clients of all ages, I\u2019m guessing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: Between the ages of 18 and death. (chuckles) I don\u2019t see kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: That\u2019s close enough. And death! Up to, but not including.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (chuckles) I see adults. That\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: (pause) Is it your experience, or your understanding, or your expectation, or assumption that... Like, when I think of people, when I try to think of other people who have experienced something bad in their life, and how they might deal with it, or how... I mean like, a friend of mine\u2019s dad <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201371\">was a gambler. That, to me, is just not the same thing, you know? Not the same stigma around gambling as there is around sexual abuse and incest. And (sighs) but do people have happy childhoods? Happy lives without... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: With no unhappiness ever?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: Well, without just that kind of shit, you know? I mean, are all things basically equal in the end?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: I doubt it, although I\u2019m not an authority on fairness. You know... yes, people have vast experiences in their lives. I don\u2019t think there is any rhyme or reason to who has what experience. But I mean, the same way that some people never face a devastating illness, you know? Some people live <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D1\">their whole lives and die at a ripe old age of nothing major. Other people face cancer and... You know? Or other chronic illnesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">So yeah, I mean, there are some people that don\u2019t have any kind of family trauma, and you know, have I think what you were referring to as a happy childhood; other people don\u2019t. They\u2019re not, you know, people respond to these things in different ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2013E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561869\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">Somebody can have what sounds like a perfectly happy childhood with no noticeable or identifiable trauma in it, and not be happy. That\u2019s the thing: happiness isn\u2019t determined, self-satisfaction, or what we think of as happiness, is not necessarily determined by your experience. That\u2019s the tricky thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201411\">about depression, right? (client affirms) People can be depressed with no identifiable trigger, and people can have what you would think would be like, a really sound trigger for an episode of depression, and not be depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I just... Yeah, I am, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s nothing as... it\u2019s not an equalizer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, life is actually not fair. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">CLIENT: (chuckles) But I guess what I think of is, you know, my father and how he was brought up, and how his father was brought up, and how these things can just kind of go on and on and on, as being kind of to be expected, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">THERAPIST: Families are all very different. There is a cycle. I mean, someone who\u2019s experienced some sort of either sexual abuse or physical abuse is more likely to repeat that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that\u2019s what I mean as far as my father\u2019s parenting habits were taught by his father, and his father\u2019s taught by his father, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">THERAPIST: I mean, yeah, there does seem to be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">CLIENT: Cyclical...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">THERAPIST: ...generational impact; (client affirms) however, it\u2019s not one to one correspondence. So there are plenty of children that grew up in homes where there was some sort of abuse (emotional, physical, sexual), that go on to either be part of families, or raise families where there is no abuse. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201511\">It\u2019s not a determinant. But there certainly is a generational impact. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m always trying to think of or... analogize how another person might be experiencing, or have experienced, some sort of... incident in their life, and how they deal with it very well. How many people are out there, suffering in a way that\u2019s similar to me, you know? I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201531\">assume it\u2019s everybody, because I used to think my family was normal, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">CLIENT: And... no one\u2019s going to come out and say, \u201cOh, yeah. No, I was raped as a teenager,\u201d or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: Some people will. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: Some people (chuckles) will. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: And it can be quite concerning (ph), to realize that there are people who have similar experiences. But I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that it\u2019s not, it doesn\u2019t have to determine your happiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: True, true. But I guess I just (sighs)... and I think this is why I try to find analogies or... share experiences, because it seems like well, in that way I can rest easy with it, because everybody... and that\u2019s kind of a diversion, diversion I think. Anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t we stop there for today.
