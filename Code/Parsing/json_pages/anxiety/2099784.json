What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Apparently there was an armed home invasion in the same neighborhood and they were in pursuit of the two...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: And they finally caught them and one they caught running down the street and the other one they caught in another house. And then they released... They called them external lockdown. So they just can't go outside. The kids had no idea that this was going on but they call you. They send you an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">e-mail. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: The kids were in the school and they just kept everybody in the school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. No one could go in. No one could go out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: And so, you know, I'm like, \"What the fuck's going on?\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Because you always... (SIGH) Not that I am an untrusting soul but when it comes to the government I'm an untrusting soul. So I'm, you know, questioning whether this is, they're telling us the truth or not. So it's kind of an emotional day yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: And when they send you like the e-mail and stuff do they make it clear what's going on? I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: They did. They said that there was a home invasion and that they're searching for these guys or whatever. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: You know? Logic kind of tells you the last place that, you know, a robber is going to go it into a school but, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I'm like, \"Are they telling the truth?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Because you always get media reports on this stuff and they're always wrong when they first come out. You know? Like I remember I had the news on while the Sandy Hook tragedy was going on and they're reporting, you know, three people went to the hospital. You know? And then I went and ran an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">errand, came back, and all the sudden twenty six people are dead. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: So... But... So that was a little, real interesting. Of course I text Jess (ph) who is in at work and she gets out of work and she doesn't listen to her voice-mail. She doesn't check her e-mail and she calls me all panicky and here I am stuck on the phone with her again. Like just, \"Fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">get out the phone.\" I'm like so fucking sick of her that just driving me nuts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">I was at the house. Was it like... It was either Saturday or Sunday and Ian was sitting in this little rocking chair and he was sitting with his feet over the armrest and... No, no, no, no, no. Yeah. And Lucille did something. You know? So he yelled at Lucille for something. So I pretty angrily yelled <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">at him, you know, whatever I yelled at him. And Jess gives me this look, you know, \"What the fuck are you doing? You know? That's not necessary.\" You know? Two seconds later she yells... I mean, literally, two seconds later she yells at him for having his feet over the armrest that he's going to break <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200412\">it. So I'm just like... You know? Then I take the kids up to the library and Ian does this top secret science class. You know, I go and I play with Lucille and so Jess met us up there because they were going to something at the armory and we go outside and, you know, Ian and I play this football game <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200413\">and we basically... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099784\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">You don't actually play the game. You manage the players and you buy better players and better skills and, you know (inaudible at 00:04:09) you know? It's like a, you know, strategy kind of game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And he really likes it. I really like it. You know, it's something we talk about all the time. And so I was telling him something about, you know, how we just got twenty five bucks or something. You get coins and you get big bucks and the big bucks you can buy better stuff and one of the ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">to get big bucks is to... They've got this website that you go to and you download apps and all you have to do it download it and run it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: ...and you get the big bucks. In fact, that's how I kind of got into this whole online dating thing is I downloaded an online dating app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So... (SIGH) So I just said something to him about, something, \"Oh, we've got twenty five big bucks for something,\" or whatever. And Jess automatically goes and like, \"What? You guys are gambling?\" I'm like, \"No. It's just a football game. It's part of the game. You know, you get rewards. You know?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: You buy stuff. She was like, \"Sounds like gambling to me.\" I'm like, \"It's not gambling.\" She's like, \"Well, it sounds like gambling to me.\" And then she kind of smiled and laughed it off and I'm like, \"Alright. I'm leaving.\" I gave Ian a hug. I tried to give... Lucille was... She had fell down <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">so she wasn't feeling good. And I just left. Just like... Just fucking sick of it. You know? It's like... I mean, I always was just like, \"You know, get off the phone. Shut the fuck up.\" You know? That always kind of annoyed me that these conversations would go on and on about her bitching about something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">You know? I just... Now I shouldn't have to take it and I still have to take it. It just fucking sucks. So... Kind of in a serious fiscal bind. This condo up in Amherst (ph), I'm trying to collecting fees in the middle of getting the default against the unit owners. They filed bankruptcy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">And the bank went and, you know, I initially got some money from the bank, paid for my fees. And in the bankruptcy proceeding they got permission to foreclose so they're going to pay off the fees. So they wanted, you know, so they asked (inaudible at 00:06:37). And there's still live seven or eight <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">hundred bucks left that I don't have that, you know, when this thing's resolved, I've got to give back. And there is a guy I owe like six hundred bucks for the fantasy football league I manage and there's other stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">And having... When I put it in Quicken all the expenses, I'm a thousand bucks in the hole. So this takes me to like twenty five hundred in the whole with nothing in the pipeline though I think I'm going to have two next month. They're streamline so the go quickly and they'll have to close the deal in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">a month. But I don't know what I'm going to do. I have one woman I think is sending me five hundred bucks but I mean, I've got all kinds of bills and shit. You know? How am I going to pay my rent? I'm going to have to ask my dad for money. And, you know, I got all this money for the farm. I wish I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">cash those and... So that kind of sucks. I went and got Chinese food yesterday. My stomach's fucking killing me, just killing me right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099784\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I've got this medication that I started taking many years ago for my disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: And usually I used it when I was very bloated with gas. You know, I'd literally be on the couch in the fetal position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: I was in that much pain from gas. And every once and awhile it was because I just ate too much. So, you know, I took it off and on and, you know, as I had less and less, you know, symptoms and whatnot, the doctor seemed a little more unwilling to give me, refill my prescriptions. And doctor... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">I don't know. Basically the man thought I was abusing it and wouldn't give me another prescription. Well when I was down in Louisiana, my stomach was really bothering me and my mom had a whole bottle of them for, you know, her knee or something like that. She had a knee replacement or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">So she gave me the whole bottle. So I, you know, do my due diligence. I'm not a complete moron. I mean, partially maybe but not complete. And the only drug interaction between... First of all, there's a risk to begin with of seizures. You're less protected against seizures. You're more prone for seizures. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">Well I've been taking this stuff for years, never had a seizure. Adderall makes it even more prone...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: ...for seizures. And of course, going back to the moron phase, the first time I took it, I said, \"Oh shit. Maybe I should see if there's any interactions.\" So I already had this in my system. I'm home alone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I'm like, \"If I have a seizure, you know, hopefully I survive banging my head on the wall or on my coffee table, you know, don't bite off my tongue and all that stuff.\" Whatever. So of course I can't tell Micah because it's not a valid prescription in my name and I probably... I usually when I've taken, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">I have taken it way at night when it's been awhile since I took the Adderall but I was just in so much pain I was like, \"Fuck it. If I have a seizure I have a seizure.\" So I shouldn't be drinking coffee. I should have (inaudible at 00:10:41). But I've got stop eating this fucking Chinese food. You know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">I don't know what to do. But it's like every time I get kind of stressed out I just... You know? And I eat the whole fucking thing. You know? It was like once or twice I was good and only ate half of it but I'm like (inaudible at 00:10:55). And then I go and I get the bottle of Coke and just... You <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200693\">know? I'm just killing myself with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">And I don't know what to fucking do about it. You know, handball's going to be starting. I haven't started taking care... You know? Getting in shape or... I got all these women that want to go on dates with me. I'm fat. Saturday I get a message from the woman whose name I do not know who blew me off <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">before because she's underwater.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: She who must not be named?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So she messages me on Saturday. She's surfaced for temporarily. Do I want to go get a drink tonight? Well... What did I have? Oh Ian was sleeping over. I was like, \"Oh, sorry. Can't do it. You know, let's pick some other time.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">Of course she ultimately picks Friday which I can't do anyway. I can't do that either. But, you know, I have this... On Sunday I ended up asking Olivia out on a date. And of course she says, \"I would love to but...\" (LAUGHTER) She has friends coming in this weekend and then the next weekend she's got <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">to go down to Pennsylvania to officiate a wedding which I thought was kind of strange at first but then today she admitted she's a little new age so now it kind of makes sense (inaudible at 00:12:39). Whatever. And I know she works like... You know, she gave me her phone number and I know she... Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">I was like, \"Well (inaudible at 00:12:47) week but she works like multiple jobs, eleven hours a day, just... So... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099784\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">Of course I text Paige (ph) because Paige doesn't like the woman who has no name. She told me she was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: ...slim and her head was too small for her body. And my response to Paige was, \"Not everybody can...\" Have I told you about this? I said, \"Not everybody can have the proportional head and a nice rack like you.\" So that's my joke now is that's how I judge these women. I'm like, \"Yeah, I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">Olivia she's got a proportional head and a nice rack.\" Not that that's what's important but, you know, she does have large boobs. (LAUGHTER) So, you know, Paige, she likes, \"Go ahead and, you know, meet with Miss Self Absorbed.\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Because I'm like... You know, I can't remember in my life when one woman has wanted me and now there's like two that at least want to go on a date with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: You know? And then last night there's a third woman who rated me four or five stars, who, you know... She likes all the bands I like. She doesn't like capital letters. Her whole thing is in lower case letters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">And she likes beards but that's not a... You know? So I start out... I go, you know, \"First of all, I like capital letters and I don't have a beard.\" (LAUGHTER) She thought I was a Jets fan. So... And then she read my message this morning. But... She's another one of these people who doesn't make her <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">profile private and she also uses the same screen name on the dating website that she does on other boards for these bands and stuff. So I know her name's Siobhan and, you know, there's like pictures of her. She's got like a half a disco ball on her head. You know? So... (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Eh, you know, he's thorough, right? Not shocking from someone who goes to Phish (ph) concerts, right? Just run of the mill. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">So I... You know, Olivia's like, \"Here's my number. Call me sometime this week. You know, we'll work it out.\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: So I called her last night.

You know? I made sure to only eat the soup and save everything until after. And the first time I call I get, \"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.\" And I'm like, \"Okay. She's not the first woman to give me the wrong number.\" (LAUGHTER) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: So I call back again...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: ...and it's one of these...

And I know how these things work. You know? On your phone it will tell you who's calling. So either she wasn't near her phone, her phone was off, or she knew it was me and she sent me to voice-mail. And so I was like... You know, I left <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">a message. It was of course funny and charming. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Naturally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she did say she laughed when she heard it. So... So I'm, you know, I just... You know, it's the Monday, eight hours of Bones. So I just, you know, watching some Bones. I actually... There was an episode I hadn't seen. I actually called her during that episode. So you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: ...I'm...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: That's commitment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: ...I'm smitten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: So I'm like, \"Well I'll wait until she calls me back,\" not eating the Chinese food. You know? It's like ten thirty and I'm like, \"Eh.\" You know? Then this other woman, you know, whatever. So I go online and, you know, I check her... I go to her profile. First of all, I set her as one of my favorites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: This is Siobhan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: This is Olivia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Oh Olivia.

You know? And I was like, \"Huh.\" You know? And like it doesn't bother me if she's talking to other guys or... You know? I'm doing the same thing. That's I guess how the ballgame works. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">You know? And I know she had been checking up on my prior because she visited my... You know? And I kind of look at it as, you know, I'm in like a competition here. So I've got to sell myself. Right? That's the way I'm approaching this thing. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">I was like, \"Alight.\" You know, instead of getting upset or whatever, you know, I just write a message or whatever. You know? Let the voice-mail. You might not notice but a lot of people say that my phone voice sounds like Barry White (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:18:21). So, you know, blah, blah, blah. Whatever. And it turns out that she says she came home... She says her (inaudible) for seven thirty. So she probably came home. She watches Bones and probably went on the dating website and then went to sleep. You know? That's what I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">thinking happened because she didn't listen to the voice-mail until morning. So... But, I mean, during the day, you know, multiple messages back and forth. It's funny because I really... I'm not that interested in really either of these other two women. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">But, you know, it's kind of like my back up plan. You know? I was like really interested in she who has no name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: And until, you know...

Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: You know? So not that I want, you know, Olivia to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: So I'm actually...

You know, meanwhile I'm, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Sending other messages as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: ...sending other messages.

So... And I cleaned a good chunk of my apartment. I did most of the dishes except for the pots and the pans. I had papers and shit just all over the kitchen table. I cleared all those off. A little bureau that I walk in and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">put my keys and, you know, was covered with shit. I cleaned all that off. You know? And all of this stuff is just paper to be recycled. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">And I wiped down the kitchen counter. I'm thinking today I might tackle the bathroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: And...

I said, \"Oh, you know, I get a drink, a shot of whiskey or something or Jameson (ph).\" Right?

So we became good friends and, you know, she's married to a woman and, you know, they have a kid. You know, I follow her online and it seems like everything was going well and it turns out that, you know, the woman left her and (inaudible at 00:23:01).

She wishes they'd put her back on Adderall and, you know, but she was glad for me. Whatever. So hopefully... We're supposed to have coffee so hopefully when she comes back in, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">(PHONE RINGING)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Micah Lighter (ph).

Maybe she's finally getting the message from Thursday that I need more Prozac. Luckily I had an old prescription that hadn't been renewed from when I was ten milligrams. I tried to renew the fifteen. I'm like... I mean, I was on twenty. I tried to renew the thirty. I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201151\">actually taking forty. So I realized that I could just renew the twenty and then when I see her today I get a prescription for the forty. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099784\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: I doubt that's why she's calling me.

That'd be great. I can get Ian after school. So, yeah, you know, I'm in this position where... You know, I kind of wanted. I felt like I could only deal with one woman at a time so I haven't been going on and looking for women. You know? And then all of the sudden, you know, R (ph), that's, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B1\">you know, she pops up and... You know? First I told her, oh, first I told her I was sick which I was. So I just kept drinking coffee, wouldn't drink any fluids and finally broke down and got some Gatorade on Saturday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">I didn't go to the... banquet I thought was on Saturday.

This has happened before, maybe even last year, when I just wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D1\">up for going. You know? Just seeing everybody wasn't important. You know? And so I didn't go. (PAUSE) But when I asked Barbara (ph) on Words with Friends on Monday, you know, \"How was the banquet?\" her response was, \"The banquet's today.\" I'm like, \"Oh shit.\" And then she said that I... It scared her <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D2\">that she had to check.

You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">So I admitted that. You know, I admitted that emotionally it was a rough day because when...

So I threw a bunch of compliments at her and she said, \"Thanks for the compliments\" but didn't compliment <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">me back and never commented on my Barry White voice but I don't know.

I know she's not a big drinker but, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: Wait.

(PAUSE) Have we talked about Wil Wheaton (ph)? Did we talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201711\">about Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher (ph) on Star Trek: The Next Generation. He was Dr. Crusher's son and he was a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: ...in a Star (inaudible) Academy, whatever, a training.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: I vaguely remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: He's actually become this cult, you know, hero.

I don't know why I'm bringing this up. Oh. So, you know, it has me thinking about, you know, was I ever suicidal and my recollection is that I really wasn't suicidal where I tried to kill myself but that I just had suicidal ideations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">You know?

You've never heard of a furtive gesture?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: Furtive is like hidden or sneaky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: It's actually a legal standard for probable cause to usurp someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Furtive of affirtive (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">CLIENT: Furtive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Furtive... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">CLIENT: So the only reason I can come up with is because of the kids...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">CLIENT: ...because I thought about that a lot. You know? It's like how can I leave these... You know, Jess's dad, his dad commited suicide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">CLIENT: So that always was weighing on me. It's like, you know, I'm not going to just... you know? And... \"Suggestive of guilty nervousness,\" but also the definition you had, \"attempted to avoid attention because of guilt or belief that discovery would lead to trouble; secretive.\" So furtive gesture, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD1\">running away, is (inaudible at 00:35:37) so maybe I didn't use that word properly. I guess you would do it secretly. You know? Only when you kill a bunch of people do you do it openly. As I've learned from Bones it's suicide by police (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:53)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">But... So I've come up with this... It's not a Catch 22. It's not a conundrum. It's... (SIGH) Well, basically it's this. The thing that stopped me from killing myself was the kids. The kind that made me want to kill myself was the kids. Not wholly...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Not wholly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">CLIENT: ...but, you know...

But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Sort of like a conundrum maybe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. A conundrum. I just think that maybe... I don't know if it's the online dating in general or my conversations with Olivia, like what am I going to tell her about me when... You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">You know, I keep looking beyond, you know, what would happen the first date which is probably a huge mistake. That's why I think I would be, you know, devastated. You know? Like she said, she likes Bones. Well, I can see us watching Bones together now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:37:19)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB\">CLIENT: Sipping some new age tea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) I asked her about it.

So I think, you know, it's forcing me to be more open, take, you know... Doing something in a relationship I've really never done. You know, flattery, you know, whatever, you know, thoughtfulness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">THERAPIST: My impression is you feel a little more (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">CLIENT: And it's like I don't know if it's that I've learned my lessons or just that, you know, all that time I was just depressed and... You know? Because what really sticks in my mind was when we were... I can't remember how old Ian was and I'm sure I've mentioned this several times before. But we're <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201D71\">sitting at dinner and I'm like literally just feeling awful, staring at my plate and Jess's like, \"What's the matter?\" I said, \"I'm not happy.\" And to me that was the beginning of the end at least in my mind because that's the only thing I can remember where she got upset because I said it in front <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201D72\">of Ian and that how can I not be happy when I've got a wife and a kid? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">You know, she turned it around on me like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DD\">CLIENT: ...I was blaming her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E1\">CLIENT: The usual... So this was like, you know, \"You never open up to me.\" You know, you finally open up and you get fucking stabbed in the back for it. You know? So that's why I think it was the beginning of the end but it was always sticks in my mind, you know, where I was just trying to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E5\">CLIENT: ...you know, just waving the flag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E9\">CLIENT: So... I don't know. I just... I think part of, part of it was I felt like I had to say nice things to these women to even get them to reply. You know, you have to. And now I feel like I've got to say nice things, number one because I believe them... But this is not like I didn't believe things <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E91\">before. I just didn't say them or I just didn't believe them so there's nothing to say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201EB\">But, you know, after last night I feel like I'm a competition now. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Well, I imagine you might be like a little more hopeful or optimistic about what a relationship could be than you were before.

I always used to say, \"Oh, you never get me cards or anything.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F5\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F7\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:41:09) but now I realize I've got to do that kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201FB\">CLIENT: You know?

I guess it's accumulation of all the different <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201FB1\">things. You know?
