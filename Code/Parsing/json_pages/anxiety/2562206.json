(pause) I\u2019m kind of just going in the moment, more or less. Like yesterday at work, when I was about to leave I was talking to Bryan and the latest experiment we\u2019re doing with Pfizer.  The data came <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">back and, for the first pass, QC and everything was fine; but then we looked deeper at the data and the samples didn\u2019t correlate well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Does that mean there\u2019s a QC problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Right. The data is kind of unusable. Usually the reason for this is when we\u2019re isolating the cells, there is other cell contamination. I didn\u2019t do that for this project, I was just the R&amp;A person. I wasn\u2019t isolating the cells.  Sophia is the one that did it and I know she\u2019s going to be bothering <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">me today all about it \u2013 things I don\u2019t want to deal with. I wish I could just build a shield. It\u2019s not like he was mad or anything, my boss, especially this project. There\u2019s always something like this happening. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it\u2019s a drug and the effects of the drug or if it\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">else.  So I guess I\u2019m just not wanting to be overwhelmed. I don\u2019t really know what I can do to make myself feel better.  Like last night I saw Paul. Usually that kind of distracts me and I\u2019m happy, but I was still kind of feeling low. I didn\u2019t really want to be around him. I didn\u2019t want to take it out <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">on him, so I just left. I don\u2019t know what I can do to move forward, I guess. (pause)  Then I went for a run after work and, just because I\u2019ve been traveling, I try to do something every day. I felt good afterwards because it had been a couple of days. I guess exercise is a cleansing or something, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">I [guess I\u2019ll go for a run tomorrow] (ph?), because I felt a lot better afterwards.  I\u2019m thinking this feeling will kind of pass as I get back to my normal schedule or whatever. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m wondering if also some of what\u2019s throwing you is this stuff about your parents and seeing them when you were back in Boise, that we talked about yesterday. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I guess part of what makes me think that is that, both with Sophia and the lab and with Paul, you\u2019re having to deal, I think, with other people\u2019s crap in a way that feels unfair and overwhelming; and that sounds to me a lot like what you were describing yesterday.  I mean not the whole story, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">but the part about the stuff with your parents. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it was because a lot of people at work asked about the interview and about the process.  I guess I want to be unhappy or ungrateful, but it seems like the option to move to Boise kind of seems like defeat, not progressing, moving backwards.  (pause) I know I shouldn\u2019t look at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">it that way because I\u2019m sure it would be good and would be exciting, but it\u2019s just because my parents are there. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking of that line from Casablanca \u2013 of all the graduate programs in all the graduate schools in all the countries . . . (long pause)  I get a sense you feel something quite significant, that feels significant, about the way that moving forward and moving backwards are kind of tied <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">together; but I don\u2019t know what it is yet. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562206\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.  I want to be happy and I want to be excited, but (inaudible at 00:15:24) (pause) I guess it just doesn\u2019t feel like progress. It just doesn\u2019t feel like . . . (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: What it reminds me of actually is how often you\u2019re dealing with difficult situations and the emotional stuff around them feels like an inextricable combination of making things worse and possibly making them better at the same time. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Like yesterday, as a recent example, talking about your parents, I think there were probably many moments where, as we talked about, it didn\u2019t feel like you were doing anything that was going to improve how you felt about it or give you some other option or something.  It just felt shitty <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">and overwhelming and more stuck. And then I guess I also have a hunch \u2013 and maybe I\u2019m wrong about this \u2013 that there were some ways in which you felt like there was some possibility in it of letting go of their stuff a little bit or letting it be a little bit, instead of feeling as stuck in it. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">my point is I think you hear talking about difficult things often, it feels like that kind of inextricable combination of \u201cReally? This is just going to make it worse and I\u2019m just going to feel more overwhelmed and stuck. And then also a sense, I think in moments, but not in others, of \u2013 and again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">maybe I have this wrong \u2013 of like \u201cmaybe it will actually bring me up a little bit or loosen some of this a little.\u201d  I guess there\u2019s something about the feel of the possibility of going to graduate school in Boise that seems like that and a combination of \u201cYuck. Moving backwards. Moving back towards <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">high school and being with my parents and dealing with all their stuff;\u201d and grad school at the same time. I\u2019m not sure what to make of that, but that\u2019s what I was thinking of. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I guess (long pause) I\u2019m feeling angry when they always say \u201cyour parents will be so happy if you move back.\u201d I was thinking about that. (pause)  It just makes me unsettled because I guess there is a lot of resentment towards my mom making me play so much softball and making me sacrifice a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">for it. She always used to say, [\u201cI thought it was the best,\u201d] (ph?) but it never made me happy and I never wanted to. I was thinking that doing something for their happiness doesn\u2019t seem like a thing I want to do. It sounds like something I think they deserve or something.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I guess she wasn\u2019t always thinking of your happiness and, for that matter, it sounds like you mentioned in what they said about making your parents happy, aren\u2019t really thinking about your happiness either. Maybe in a way it feels like I don\u2019t either, like I may have an idea about what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">difficult about moving back to Boise, but maybe it would feel more like I\u2019m looking out for your happiness if I was saying, \u201cYeah, I bet you would be much happier somewhere else.\u201d  (pause) Instead of being so focused on how really permanent you sound like you anticipate it will be if you move back there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562206\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: I know I can be in my own little grad school bubble or whatever and I think I get consumed by that. (pause)  I don\u2019t want to be there to feel the guilt of not spending time with them or not helping them or whatever. (inaudible at 00:27:44) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know what happened there. I was saying that maybe they are also making this difficult for you; and then you actually really start to doubt yourself. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) I guess I\u2019m just not . . . (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you feel it\u2019s like me pushing you too far or something like that if I say maybe parents and friends and, in a way, me, are making things difficult or are making you feel bad.  And then you say, \u201cDamn right. It\u2019s hard enough as it is. I won\u2019t handle that well,\u201d like you have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">back off about what you were upset about a little bit to placate me. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess I just feel like, in the end, maybe it is the end. I have such a problem with going there and why did I even apply to that school? I should be excited or be happy. (long pause)  I guess I don\u2019t know what else I can do to be more happy or succeed because I feel like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">just cleaning up messes all the time. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: I was thinking that I imagine that you feel like deciding about Vanderbilt has you sort of turned the grad school thing into a mess and it doesn\u2019t have to be like that \u2013 or you chose to apply there. The downside of something that you could be excited about or could feel good about or it could <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">feel like moving forward, it feels like another mess, something you have to deal with or clean up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it gets . . . (long pause)  I\u2019m not sure about this, but I think it may have started to feel to you like the conversation in here between you and me got messy. And then you first decided that you were a mess and then projected the mess out there onto this graduate school. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">not saying that it\u2019s not a very difficult situation or that it wouldn\u2019t feel, in itself, messy anyway, but there is a way in which the mess kind of keeps moving around.  I think it\u2019s graduate school or it\u2019s your parents; graduate school is, I think, something in our conversation and then it\u2019s back to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">being as you and it\u2019s graduate school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: There\u2019s no solution or getting past it. It\u2019s always there. There\u2019s always a problem. There\u2019s always something to get anxious about and then forget and then it will come back again.
