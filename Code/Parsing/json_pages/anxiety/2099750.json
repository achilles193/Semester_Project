I had a performance review today which I've been incredibly anxious about for the last couple of weeks. It went okay, there were no surprises. It was really hard to hear criticism so on other things I don't communicate enough, I don't ask for help soon enough, I spend too much time <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">spinning my wheels and I focus too much on problems that are not high priority. I have trouble distinguishing the high priority items from the low priority items although my boss thinks that's just a matter of my lack of experience and as I learn more the problem will fix itself. He also commented about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">my use of the Internet and how it's too much and gives the perception that I'm not fully engaged with the work.  There was also good stuff. He approved of the aggressiveness of which I pursue problems once I've sunk my teeth into them and gave me an exceptional rating in the category \"Actively improves <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">self and others\" which I don't fully understand what that category is about. Yeah\u2026 (pause) I actually solved a problem all by myself without help from my mentor today so that was kind of a peak I guess. (pause) So Thursday is Nowruz, which is the Persian New Year, also the vernal equinox which is when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F4\">the New Year is celebrated in or was celebrated in ancient Persia before the Islamic Empire ended and forced everyone to convert but it's a holiday that my family celebrates, a lot of the Persian traditions got brought to India when the Mongol Empire conquered India and because that's my families ethnic <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F5\">background.  It's what we celebrate even though we're not Iranian and this confuses a lot of people including a lot of Iranians who have no idea that their culture has spread far and wide but anyway I usually throw a big party for Nowruz every year and it's something that I usually look forward to a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F6\">lot and I started planning about a month ago and then I never sent out the invitation because every time I sat down to write the invitation I kind of got seized by anxiety and couldn't bring myself to type it up and send it out. So I'm not going to have a party this year which I'm a little upset about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F7\">it because it's just like my own stupid, jerk brain getting in my way, like there's no reason not to other than I couldn't write the invitation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I don't know what's up with that, like why I got so anxious and upset about it. (pause)  I think part of it is that I had asked my work mentor Brian for his personal e-mail address so that I could invite him to the party and then I started second guessing that decision and couldn't think of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">a way to back out of inviting him after I told him I was going to invite him. Like at first I thought it would be a good idea because in the past I have developed friendships with him and we get along really great at work and we share a lot of the same interests and hobbies and cultural values but on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">the other hand he's my mentor at work and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Is he also your boss?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Okay. That's what I thought but I wasn't sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I mean he has a much higher title in the company than I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: He's the\u2026we're both working on a title and he's nominally the component lead for it but he's not a manager in any sense of the word.

(inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. So there's that and then, I don't know I guess I had a really good time at HudCon and the previous weekend there were three birthday parties I went to and I also had really good times at those also but I was feeling maybe a little bit like I'd been around people too much and the thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">of having fifteen to twenty people in my apartment kind of made me panic a little bit. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: What makes these things kind of overwhelming? Or have you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And? Some of the stuff about the party\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: And the feeling of \"Okay, Brian, I'm overwhelmed, here you go.\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: (laughs) \"Take it, only friends please.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: (laughs) \"Take it; I'm just going to, you know\u2026\" (laughs) That's okay, I'm not (inaudible) but (pause)\u2026  I know you have strong feelings about both things in ways that make them hard to think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I guess in ways that relate to feeling judged, eventually by your mentor who'd maybe come to the party and really going out on a limb there to suggest that your worries about the performance review may have something to do with pictures of being judged. (laughs) Stretch but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Not much of a stretch though. (pause) (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: What's coming to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I just can't shake the feeling that I've just felt so tired and so overcommitted lately and maybe I should drop one of my weekly hard commitments? They're all things that are important to me but\u2026some of them I kind of need like this appointment, like\u2026there's just not enough hours in the day <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">and neither my piano instructor nor my voice instructor do weekend appointments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: That would make my life easier if I could just go home after work but\u2026 (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Neither does your shrink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Nor your shrink. I can't offer you weekend appointments\u2026because I don't have them. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Sometimes I can stack things if they're on the same day but you know usually my Monday's are come here and then go from here to voice lessons but for the last month that hasn't been possible because there's this kind of adult formation program for my church that's on Monday's that I go to instead <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">which means I go to voice lessons on Friday's and that's just one more day of the week where I'm going somewhere after work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: It seems to me your thinking in kind of a supportive way about yourself which is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Meaning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Your saying like \"I'm tired, I've got a lot to do, I love doing all of it which is great but it's wearing me out!\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: It really is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: And you know \"Maybe I\u2026maybe it's okay to think about doing less in something?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But I don't know where I can relieve the pressure in my schedule and still be reasonably happy? (pause) I think if I had, if sleep weren't such an issue then maybe I could get up earlier and get to work earlier and not spend so much time in the morning just lying in bed, staring <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">at the ceiling, being exhausted and unable to get up. Right? Because that's at least thirty to forty-five minutes a day. If I could get to work thirty to forty-five minutes earlier then you know, I could have a dinner break between getting off work and getting to wherever it is I need to get to in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B2\">evening. I would get to those appointments earlier and get home earlier or (sighs) but\u2026 I mean both Saturday and Sunday I took three hour naps in the middle of the day and I still felt exhausted and unable to get out of bed this morning. (pause) It's scary because Dave wants children, I want children, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B3\">but I really, I can't imagine being any more tired than I am now and surviving in any way. It's scary. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099750\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I imagine you're a little worried saying something like that to me, that I'm going to\u2026Your saying you're having a hard time with something and you're afraid about it and I imagine you're worried that somehow I'm going to bring it back to being your fault or tell you you shouldn't be afraid <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">about it, not to make you (inaudible) you know, I'm not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Right. No that hadn't occurred to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: No? (pause)  Is it more that it's kind of overwhelming to think about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause)  What other thoughts do you have about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I don't know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Is it that you're looking for guidance or reassurance, guidance on how to think about it or reassurance about\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I think I'm always looking for guidance. You've made it pretty clear that that's not how you work so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Is that annoying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: A little bit but you know\u2026if it were really that annoying I would find a new shrink. (sighs) I guess it's just seems to me like it's an intractable problem because like sleep has been an issue for so long and so many approaches to fixing it haven't worked.  Even when I was not as scheduled in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">the evenings didn't have\u2026over the summer when there wasn't choir because choir was out of season, we only sing from September to May and we take the summer off, before I started taking lessons, then all summer was voice lessons, I was still exhausted all the time and I still felt overwhelmed. But at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">least now I'm doing enjoyable things that make me happy so\u2026I don't know what to do and I don't know that there is anything I can do. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Are the sleep issues pretty much unchanged?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Mm hm. They're not as terrible as they were at their worst but still it's hard for me to get to sleep and I still wake up fairly frequently. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: I have a couple of thoughts. One was if we did something more intense, more analysis, we might be able to get more traction on the issue with sleep but A. It could take a while, it usually takes a while and B. That would involve more of your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: But you know, it's certainly something to think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Um (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: It's gotten to the point where I dread going to bed because it feels like a failure, that I can't get to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099750\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Like you're fucking up because you can't fall asleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yep. Which I realize is probably only exacerbating the problem and is certainly not helping but once the negative self-talk begins it's really hard to shut it down. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Is it at all correlated, either way, like positively or negatively with how well things are going or how stressful they are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Not that I can tell but I haven't been tracking that so I don't have good data. You know another thing that's incredibly frustrating is that I'll be awake doing something like in the living room or in my study, on the Internet or reading a book or working on some project and I'll start to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">really, really sleepy and really, really tired and I'll think \"This is great, I'm really tired\" and I'll get up and brush my teeth, put on pajamas, go to bed and as soon as I lie down I'm wide awake and can't get to sleep.  That happened last night actually. I was at a friend's house for St. Patrick's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">day, so we had dinner and watched a movie, you know played a drinking game while we were watching a movie, called a cab to go home, I was literally falling asleep in the cab, it was like \"Fantastic, I'll actually get to sleep tonight.\" I paid the cabbie, walked in the door, crawled into bed, wide awake. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200873\">Not able to sleep. The last time I remember noting on the clock last night was 3:34 a.m. and I'm not sure if I was actually awake until 3:34 or if I slept and then woke up again at 3:34, it's not clear to me but\u2026(pause)  (coughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: It sounds like your feeling terribly overwhelmed, I mean each of the things you've brought up today is something that is big or points towards very big things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And each of which is also I think very hard to like sort of think about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: And (pause) I imagine you do really want some guidance with this stuff and my hunch is that part of what you want is\u2026part of what would be helpful with the guidance is it would make you feel more like I was really on your side with it and I'm not saying you feel like I'm not on your side, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">but that I was like, not in the trenches, at least kind of\u2026I don't know, more like that.

This is a critique he also made of the two senior engineers within <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">our project, all three of us, our background is in hand place design and this new tool flow has got all of us practically thrown off balance but yeah (laughs) it sounded very similar to your objections too, in my particular case, using instrumental solutions and how that is probably not helpful to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah I guess I'm\u2026with the sleep stuff in a way it's a little easier in that I'm sure you've tried umpteen instrumental solutions so there it's sort of easier and sort of an issue I'm sure I couldn't think of anything anyway but I do think this issue of the ways in which it\u2026I guess it probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">seems very obvious to you that of course that's what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099750\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Like \"What the hell?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: \"I have a problem. I want some help!\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Usually that involves suggestions or at the very least more help talking about it. I could be sitting here not making suggestions but asking you questions about the performance review, the sleep, the party, you know in a way that would help you to think it through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: But you do do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: There's also the issue that you start suggesting instrumental solutions to me even though that's what I want, I know myself well enough to know that as soon as you start making those suggestions I'll start digging in my heels and be \"I don't want to, you can't make me\" part of my brain will <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">kick in and \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: It's good to know that's where we'd be headed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm actually glad you're so stubborn about not providing any solutions because it would end badly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: But I can't stop wanting them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Even though I know, that's kind of like I know eating that bowl of ice cream will upset my stomach and I'll regret it later, but I do it anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It's probably a good analogy again in that I imagine you do both, feeling for something kind of concrete to help you with your anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Like a comfort in this\u2026sometimes those things can help. And you probably do that at times when you're anxious and not that you to some extent lose the capacity to think which I think indicates how scary this stuff is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: And like also how very alone you can feel with it, I mean to me there really is this feeling, I don't always have this feeling when somebody's asking me for instance what the solution is, the feeling for you is there really is something about it would make it feel like we were on the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">team more so and that would mean a lot.  Like you wouldn't feel you were shouldering the burden so much on your own. (pause) We should stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yep.
