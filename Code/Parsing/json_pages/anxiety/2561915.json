I understand, it\u2019s really cold here. It\u2019s really cold everywhere. At first, like I\u2019ve noticed that well, my bed schedule\u2019s been off a little bit coming from Florida, and sometimes staying up late for New Year\u2019s Eve parties and then having the flu sort of you know, when you have the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">flu you sort of just kind of sleep whenever, and it\u2019s hard, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: To get back to a normal schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: When did you notice that your anxiety was up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t until like I think after New Year\u2019s is when I realized that I had to start getting back to work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">And I was at home all day and excuse me, my voice is going. I hope I don\u2019t have the flu. And I didn\u2019t notice it then, because what I was really doing is I was, well I was working at home. I was spending a big portion of my time looking up wedding stuff, and I\u2019d be feverishly looking for like the right <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">colors, the right accessories, the bridesmaid\u2019s dresses and obsessing over like, because of the way some of the things that are more expensive look, the band and the venue. There\u2019s not much money left in the budget to pay for bridesmaid\u2019s dresses, so I was going to have the bridesmaids pay for them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">and I would help out. At first I thought it was going to pay half, but unfortunately at The Nutcracker, I didn\u2019t, when I helped my mom at last Christmas, I didn\u2019t get as much money as I thought I would, and so that sort of set me back from having extra money to pay for half. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So I realize I\u2019ll probably have to do tutoring this semester, which I\u2019ll bring up in a second. I think it\u2019s a good thing, though, but and then I was obsessing over like if the bridesmaid\u2019s dresses are three hundred, they\u2019re really expensive, is it worth it, can people afford it, what colors they should <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">be. And then like my sister was in a long, because there was a dress. So she might not even be a bridesmaid because of when her hip surgery is, and I mean, I don\u2019t, I mean she\u2019ll still be a bridesmaid or, you know, maid of honor, but she won\u2019t be walking. And so I was thinking that, you know, there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">was a dress that everyone else like a little bit better than the one that, we will end up choosing because the high, she has to have a high back because she, when she was doing some sort of, like sort of a electricity pain management system, she accidentally sort of electrocuted herself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And she had a big scar on her back, and it\u2019s definitely light, but she feels very self-conscious about it. But, I mean, and I guess I feel bad, because I kind of asked her the question like you know, this other dress is two hundred and fifty six dollars, and we save three hundred dollars. I, actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">effectively, if I were paying for half, it would be, I\u2019d be saving a hundred and fifty, which, you know, nowadays sort of see, a hundred and fifty is sort of exchangeable. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. But I was like, you know, you could always put a nude lining in the back of yours, or like you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">how much, like or <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561915\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">I guess I feel bad about having people pay like a lot of money for a dress, and maybe that\u2019s just part of being a bridesmaid is that you, and a lot of my friends make more than me. I earn a student\u2019s salary, my sister doesn\u2019t earn a salary, and so she got really upset the fact that, you know, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">trying to change the dress, because for her wedding, I got to pick the dress. In hindsight, I don\u2019t know if I really like the dress now, but it seemed to be the best of all the other options. But yes, she seemed really upset, and then we got talking about budget and budgets are really sort of sensitive <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">subject because they\u2019re, I mean, weddings are always compromises, and who\u2019s paying for what. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">Like originally, I, mom told me thirty thousand is what I get, and then when I went back to Florida, she\u2019s like, \u201cTwenty-five thousand.\u201d I was like, well wait, you told me thirty thousand and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, okay, well.\u201d I don\u2019t actually, and then she brought up that they\u2019re having to remortgage their <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">house, but this is in hindsight that they just spend like seventy thousand redoing their house, so you know, it\u2019s just sort of, it\u2019s frustrating because I felt like really guilty about even having a wedding when I found out that my parents were remortgaging their house and going from a fifteen-year <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">loan to a thirty-year loan, which is thirty-year loans are pretty standard. But and then I also felt frustrated because some of the expensive things were the choice of having a band and having an outdoor wedding with a tent and that being, not having it on Saturday versus Sunday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">All of these things were requirements of Jeremy, like he was really not going to budge on any of those and that was like five thousand dollars of the budget, and you know, of course his dad is helping out, and consequently, his dad\u2019s paying for the photographer, but I mean there\u2019s all these sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">little things, that, you know paying for, who\u2019s going to pay for the cake, who\u2019s going to be paying for the bridesmaids, and I, really frustrating asking people for money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">And I told that last night to Jeremy, because I said that his, I was talking about caves and had sort of a, not an argument anyway, but he was just there saying, \u201cOh, bridezilla,\u201d and I was like, \u201cMe, bridezilla, you\u2019ve been a bridezilla.\u201d And he was like, \u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019ve been forgiving, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">like really easygoing about everything.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">And then I brought up, I was like, \u201cYou know, Jeremy, some of the things that you weren\u2019t easygoing on, those are the expensive things.\u201d And he thought I was trying to persecute him. And I don\u2019t know, maybe I did have sort of like, because I feel guilty like spending money on a wedding where it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">important to me, and I\u2019d rather, again, I guess maybe that\u2019s the sort of thing is that these things are just important to Jeremy rather than important to us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What is important to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Well, having people gathered around for, you know, I guess I would say getting married in a church and just sort of having a pretty table setting and tasty food and a pretty tasty cake. I guess the food, the food was really important to me and I suppose both of us, and the same as, because that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">something that\u2019s important to us on a normal day. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561915\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">In terms of music, like I wouldn\u2019t, like I mean, a DJ, even if it\u2019s like music, sort of like whether it\u2019s live or you know, as long as there\u2019s some music, it doesn\u2019t have to be live music. Like in, I mean, albeit the band that we have is, plays at a dive bar, we go there occasionally. I mean, it\u2019s a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">pretty dive bar, but it\u2019s, you know, we\u2019ve gone and seen them live and they\u2019re affordable for a wedding band. And having, you know what, for me, like I don\u2019t see a difference between having the wedding on Saturday versus Sunday except for maybe Sunday people from out of town have to leave, so, but I mean <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">We\u2019re having the wedding in Providence, so most of the people who are coming from out of town are my people, and I just, you know, just, I saw that, you know, if they\u2019re going to have to miss a day of work, they\u2019re going to have to miss it on Friday anyway for the rehearsal dinner, so I mean, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">the day, the actual venue, like I was fine like having it any sort of a, I mean a more historical like a, what is it, a preservation site, something that\u2019s smaller or like a barn or. I mean, I think Jeremy just really wanted to be outside, and I think that was, maybe I had some ill sentiment when we <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">were fighting about that. Because to me, an outside wedding can be beautiful, but it can also be disastrous, depending on the weather. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">And I remember like, there are things that, you know, that even just really not budging on. And the same like I know I freaked out about buying a dress that he would like, and as it turns out, I don\u2019t know if he, I mean, you saw the dress. It\u2019s supposed to be something that I like, and I do like it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">but I mean, there could have been other things that, I don\u2019t know. I guess I just sort of made it, I\u2019ll say the wedding is kind of stressful because it is a big, it is a big process, and big money being spent. And, you know, there\u2019s always this sort of this taking for granted and I guess I just wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">Jeremy to know that you know, some of these things that we\u2019re paying for are things that, and I guess maybe this was kind of because I feel like, you know, I\u2019m paying for the bridesmaid dresses, I\u2019m, or paying for a lot of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">You know, especially because then my sister was saying that even for the little baby flower girl that I need to buy the two hundred dollar dress or else my whole wedding\u2019s going to look clunky and off, and I just got pissed off, because I\u2019m like, I am not paying, like I can understand junior bridesmaid, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">they have to have their similar dress, so pay for that as well. But, you know, I was just, you know, I was just sort of getting annoyed that my sister has so much input and she isn\u2019t exactly like, it took her forever to do anything. But when I mention something, she\u2019s very negative about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">And so and that\u2019s one sense like an antagonist. I feel like there\u2019s been a lot of antagonists here, and you know, I, you know I guess I just get frustrated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">Because sometimes. I mean, I guess, because Jeremy\u2019s, I mean, he\u2019s doing a little bit for the wedding, but a lot of that I\u2019m doing, and it\u2019s like, if you guys are going to be antagonistic, why don\u2019t you come up with ideas? Or and just Tammy, it took her forever to like, I mean, when I asked her about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">bridesmaid\u2019s dresses, she showed me a bunch in the beginning and then like two months later, I asked her, \u201cOh, what are your top ten?\u201d And she\u2019s like, she never answered me. And then like when it comes to like, \u201cOh, what color combinations were you thinking of?\u201d she never answered me until like a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">months later, and it sort of. I mean, I guess maybe this sort of shows that maybe I\u2019m not the best leader. I\u2019m sort of used to having my work and my control and having input. But and, it is good because now sort of the vision is sort of the decorations have changed a little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561915\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">Because I\u2019m able to talk about it with people and show people things and see how things work out together, so in that sense I\u2019m you know, I\u2019m, I don\u2019t mind so much the little details. But I guess sometimes, when Jeremy says I\u2019m a, I mean, he was just joking, but I just sort of felt\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I did. But I was like, \u201cI\u2019m a bridezilla,\u201d because I mean, you know, it\u2019s sort of like I have a sister that\u2019s like having me think about all like the dresses, and the little details, and sort of not understanding my vision or wanting to understand my vision. I have Jeremy who has his own <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">sort of idea of things, but then sort of thinks I\u2019m a bridezilla because I\u2019m actually doing something. I\u2019m looking for these vases and thinking about money and thinking about all the DIYs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">And I mean, he\u2019s just sort of like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s too much work.\u201d Well, I mean, it\u2019s definitely, I love doing DIYs and I don\u2019t mind spending eight hours on a weekend doing one, even though it\u2019s consecutive weekends, but so it\u2019s sort of frustrating that there\u2019s so many possibilities out there and I get excited, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">but it\u2019s hard for, you know, I, there\u2019s a lot of people that are downers that aren\u2019t like so excited and thrilled, and, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so beautiful, that\u2019s so cool, can I help out?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: So you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re getting a lot of support for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: So you came in saying you felt anxious, but it, as you\u2019re telling the story, the feeling that I hear is more disappointed and angry, so I\u2019m wondering, what am I missing? Or is it really more than you\u2019re feeling disappointed and the responses you\u2019re getting and angry at the lack of excitement <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">and support. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: So those I think, you know, it\u2019s interesting because those are sort of, that\u2019s on one layer, and the other layer is me staying up until three am working on the PowerPoint presentation of the wedding as opposed to my work. So it\u2019s when I show people the work, and that\u2019s when I get angry and feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">disappointed. But when I\u2019m working on it, like I will spend six hours looking at vases trying to find, what is the right vase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And not enjoying those six hours looking at vases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Oh no, I do. Oh I do. I enjoy, but it\u2019s kind of like a, rather than doing my research, I\u2019ve just been sort of, you know, if I had to divide the day, I would say maybe about a third has been research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re starting to feel a little anxious about the balance or the imbalance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, and especially because like I need to apply for a job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">And I need to read before I apply for the job. I didn\u2019t want, because last time I gave my presentation for the job at the labs, I still haven\u2019t heard back from the second interview, which sometimes I hear is typical. They sort of just don\u2019t contact you for awhile. Which, I don\u2019t really sort of care <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">about, because like whatever. But my, I mean, I did care about it, but now I\u2019m sort of apathetic and have sort of moved on to maybe a different company that my advisor suggested. But I didn\u2019t want to interview with the same presentation which one group said sucked as. Well, they didn\u2019t say it sucked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">as, they just said the presentation was mediocre and I didn\u2019t have a good handle on my research.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561915\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">And so before I did the other interview, I wanted to find out more about the company, read their papers so when I go into the interview become, and I\u2019ll just sort of like fall in, like \u201cOh, I\u2019m a great candidate.\u201d You know, just really be\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: Be more specific. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so I\u2019ve been waiting to do that and I have all like four or five papers that I have to read through, and yet last night, I couldn\u2019t get to sleep at all last night, I\u2019ve been sort of on this go to bed at three thirty, four, and waking up at, waking up maybe at nine to have breakfast <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200591\">and then going back to bed or just Jeremy this weekend, just didn\u2019t wake me up. He was like, \u201cI thought I wanted to let you sleep.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, Jeremy, this is a disservice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">I would say that it was very sweet that you didn\u2019t want to wake me up, but in a sense, it\u2019s best that I face this brutal shock of waking up at a normal hour on the weekend, so then I said, \u201cNever let me sleep past ten thirty, unless you\u2019re sleeping with me.\u201d Because then you know, like a lot of it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">the day\u2019s gone. But I\u2019ve just been really glued to my computer and having a hard time like getting the motivation to go play racquetball or so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">And a lot of it is I\u2019m looking for responses from my sister and I\u2019m wondering about you know, just sort of looking for the right vases and colors and wedding cakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: When is your deadline for making those detailed decisions about picking vases, frosting colors, settings, those kind of details?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: So since I\u2019ve already been buying a lot of the stuff for the place settings, but the real, so for dresses it\u2019s probably at the end of February, so that probably needs to be, and I said that by the end of January, and I sent an e-mail to my bridesmaids. At least two of them said, \u201cSounds good.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">The others I haven\u2019t heard from, but they\u2019re probably busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">And then like the band, well, you know, usually I mean, it probably needs to be done pretty soon because bands sort of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: I thought you booked a band? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: No. We e-mailed them and we said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Well they sort of set a pencil for us because no one\u2019s asked them yet, but we haven\u2019t paid them yet, so we need to draw up that contract. And that means that I need to ask mom for money. So that\u2019s one thing that probably I need to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I think it would be helpful, because it sounds like you clearly have to spend some time, you know, you\u2019re planning your wedding. You need to spend some time doing that, and it can be enjoyable. But you also have to set aside time to do your work because you\u2019re also earning your doctorate. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">So it might be helpful to kind of, you know, set some time limits for yourself about when decisions really need to be made. So if you need to make a decision on you know, the dresses, by the end of February, well you could think about it a lot over the next seven weeks, or you could think about it for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200692\">two weeks at the end of February. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561915\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">And, you know, it sounds like these decisions will take up as much space as you give them, and they might not need to take up all that time. You know, limiting your choices a little bit and limiting the amount of time that you give them will leave you energy and time to focus on the other things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">you need to do. And I think if you can front some of that, and if you can front those articles that you want to read for your new company, and if you get, maybe sit down with somebody and find out, well what would make your presentation better, what would make it more focused? And confront those issues, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B2\">the anxiety\u2019s probably going to come down a bit. I think part of the anxiety is that while you\u2019re looking at the different vases, you know that there\u2019s this other stuff back here that\u2019s not being looked at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">And it just sits there and it grows. So what about setting some time lengths, I\u2019m going to, you know, talk to Mom about the money for the band and do that contract this week, and set a time when you\u2019re really going to focus and buckle down on the various decisions. Say a week, that you\u2019re going to spend <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D1\">really thinking about the dresses and making a final choice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">But not letting them all, not letting all of these decisions balloon into this huge time frame, eating up your academic space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that\u2019s, I mean that\u2019s sort of I think that\u2019s why they have in a lot of those magazines, checklists, things you need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and when you need to do them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: So maybe that\u2019s something that I should, I mean, I have so many bridal magazines, where I sort of skim over those checklists and I get that, and that sounds good. But maybe perhaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: It might be helpful, and just, and you know, I think, if I remember correctly, a lot of the stuff on those checklists can be ignored and still have a wedding, but maybe giving yourself a timeline of when you want to pay attention to the things that you, that are important to you, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">you know, what I really want to guard against is adding seven more things to your to-do list that don\u2019t need to be there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">What you want to do is limit how much time each to-do gets, and enough so that it feels like you\u2019re making, so you can get the enjoyable pieces of, you know, browsing and thinking and maybe you like this design stuff, so you want to get the enjoyable pieces but what you don\u2019t want to do is feel anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">because it\u2019s taking up space that it\u2019s not supposed to take up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it might be that maybe if I just allow myself like Friday through Sunday to think about wedding, like every week have sort of a wedding sort of regroup, and this is one thing that my mom suggested when I told her that Jeremy was getting sort of beat down by the details or I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: He might not be able to hear about them every day, and you might not be able to get into it every day if you want to have time for something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: A real, yeah, so that might just be like I can\u2019t talk about it Monday through Thursday, and that\u2019s actually, I think that will be, you know, it will, and it\u2019ll be much healthier, a much healthier balance. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561915\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">THERAPIST: That might be a good strategy for you, a way that you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re ignoring it, but it also might not take over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, and that\u2019s actually why, I think, I mean besides needing a little bit extra money to pay for like some of the wedding details, there\u2019s the like working from home I remember that, you know, if I just have a scholarship like I do this semester, I realize that I just stay at home all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200831\">time and then it gets harder to leave, harder to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not teaching this semester?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: No, and so I thought that if I had like a tutoring appointment, like twice, two to three times a week, for an hour, it would get me out of the house and get me here, so that I\u2019d be ready to study and do work here, and I think sitting in a library is a lot more encouraging than sitting at home <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">with your <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">I mean, I do say that the cats, and while I\u2019m doing programming, I have to play with them, because they\u2019ll be biting my foot otherwise, and so I think as much as I love those little buggers, I\u2019m also kind of\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">THERAPIST: A distraction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and even if I\u2019m here, just to get the day going from you know, ten until four, that should be good enough to, you know, sort of set the day off right and then sort of, I just thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s too\u2014\u201d because I did really like that about teaching because I got a lot of work done. Granted, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">because I was working like crazy, but because I was talking about physics and talking to the undergrads, they\u2019re so enthusiastic. I really liked that, so you know, just being around that was, it really fostered me to, you know, push myself harder and apply for jobs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">And, you know, get work done and try and be as organized as possible, albeit sometimes that was difficult last semester. But so I realize that by tutoring it would get me here, and since I\u2019ve already sort of done this material, I\u2019ve been a, it wouldn\u2019t be much preparation and then just sort of talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">it over and so I kind of like that idea. And just sort of to get the ball rolling, to get me here on time, because I was sort of, I mean, I\u2019m so glad I had therapy today or else I would have just sort of probably slept in until like one from ten to one then started to get working kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">Maybe by four o\u2019clock, Jeremy\u2019s, because Jeremy\u2019s coming home early is another thing and it\u2019s hard to, I mean, he makes a lot of noise when he feels that he wants attention, just like the cat. I mean, our cat will start meowing at random places. I want you to go over there and chase him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">And then he\u2019ll run away after he\u2019s meowed for a minute, so I mean Jeremy\u2019s a little bit like that too. I mean, sometimes when we\u2019re working, when he\u2019s like working at home all day rather than just have an early day, coming, like when he\u2019s working he\u2019s quiet, but when he\u2019s not working he\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: He wants to play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, he does. And I sort of thought that just by, I mean, I love home, and it\u2019s so hard for me to leave home, and that\u2019s why I sort of realize that I need that sort of force.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: And something to be accountable to get you out. That\u2019s pretty normal. It\u2019s much easier to sort of stick to a schedule when there\u2019s some sort of external reinforcement.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561915\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">CLIENT: Pressure, yeah, and there\u2019s also a reward because I\u2019d be getting paid directly, which I like. You know, it just gives me a little bit of extra income, especially like to help out like racquetball, and it\u2019s hard because racquetball is an expensive sort of hobby. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">And then again yoga, all hobbies are expensive these days, especially when they\u2019re, I mean, it\u2019d be different if I was out in the boondocks and I was like some sort of random racquetball studio that would probably be a lot cheaper, but I mean, the quality instruction and facilities, so and I get it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D1\">but it\u2019s still expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You have to fund it somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I started to see that if there\u2019s, you know, actually, it was actually it was nice when Jeremy and I, we found these vases there are just these glass, these vintage-y looking glasses, and I go, \u201cOh, these are perfect. These work for vases.\u201d And then it was just so much easier instead <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A11\">of like dwelling on the Internet. Sometimes just seeing something in person and so I realize that maybe a lot of these, you know, I sort of have these things sort of made up in my mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">Kind of now, what\u2019s going to happen, but I sort of see that okay, now things are sort of need to be ordered, and maybe right down a budget of how much needs, how to string things out and make sure they come in time, so I think I\u2019ll feel a little bit better, I think just writing it out. I think if it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A31\">in my head, I just sort of, because it\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">TAPE ENDS ABRUPTLY HERE<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
