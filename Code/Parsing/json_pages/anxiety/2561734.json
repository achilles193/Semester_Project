Ohhh, so you know how I\u2019ve been lately is a little tired. First of all, I\u2019ve been seeing awful dreams now, very stressful dreams and, today, I was just thinking, I was like, you know what, I think I\u2019ve got to let myself be tired (chuckles). I\u2019m doing a lot of shit, man. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Uh-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: You know, and I do feel really good, but it\u2019s a lot, like my mind is tired, you know? And I feel, I feel stiffer back here, I think than I\u2019ve ever been. Like my hip is even kind of hurting, you know what I mean? I\u2019m just (sighs.) It\u2019s a weird combination of feeling the best I\u2019ve ever felt, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">that doesn\u2019t mean, you\u2019re relaxed, but you\u2019re not, at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Uh-hum, uh-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: But, yea, Sunday\u2014or was it Sunday night? I don\u2019t know. Two nights ago or three nights ago, it was so\u2014I had never in my life awoken in the dream? I had chest pains? And when I woke up, I had chest pains, so\u2014I mean, that\u2019s never happened. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of weird\u2014even when I\u2019ve had night terrors <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">or whatever, that was really weird. I didn\u2019t like that at all (chuckles). Umm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: What was the dream? Can you remember (inaudible)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Uhh, yea, I\u2019m just putting them in all in my voice memo, I just, umm\u2014It wasn\u2019t even particularly awful. It was just really, really vivid. And the thing I do remember is a woman said \u201cHey.\u201d She worded it so weird, she said \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you going to become Brian? (sp?)\u201d or something like that? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">And she was like, yea, like that, and just as I was doing that, I had just really sharp pain, and then I woke up and I was like, that\u2019s really there, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Now, I had had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at fucking 2 in the morning or something. That doesn\u2019t help, but<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Are you sure it\u2019s the peanut butter sandwich gave you a bad dream? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: What, (laughs) (crosstalk) right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Peanut butter sandwich. That was a very particular dream. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea. And it was on the UConn campus, even though it wasn\u2019t the UConn campus. Umm. Yea, that was weird. Then there was this other thing in it where, I\u2019ve been seeing these weird, like threesome things, where like I\u2019m having a threesome with two women? But it\u2019s not\u2014it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">end well, or it doesn\u2019t start well. This was, I mean, this was very Freudian, I think this one because, as it was happening, I was like these women aren\u2019t even really attractive or whatever, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Uh-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Oh, also it was kind of in public.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561734\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Umm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: But it wasn\u2019t like, at least I don\u2019t think I was naked. I think they were or something, but\u2014and one of them, when I put my hand down there, it was like sharp and like sharp teeth or something. It was really weird. Yea, I never had anything like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: And you were scared? or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: No, I just kept doing like, oh, what the fuck, that\u2019s weird, that doesn\u2019t feel right, you know? I don\u2019t think I was scared at all in the dream. A lot of these dreams I\u2019ve been seeing, just in the past few days, they\u2019re more like just stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Uh-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Like I just feel rushed or stressed or, like last night, I had a dream where these big, pale green larva-looking like insects kept coming out of places, and I kept spraying them and shit, and, yea, just, yea. (pause) I think I feel\u2014I think it\u2019s a lot of (blows breath) I\u2019m  really getting selfish, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">like I really just want to be left alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">I don\u2019t want to go to this fucking wedding this weekend. I think that\u2019s stressing me out, to be honest. I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got to take a ferry. I\u2019ve got to crash with my friend in his room because I can\u2019t afford my own room, and then once I\u2019m there, I\u2019m there. You know what I mean, you know? I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">don\u2019t want to go. I really don\u2019t want to go. And then we have a show Tuesday, which I mean, it\u2019ll be fine. I just feel like I\u2019m so focused on this part of my life right now, like my inner world, I just, I don\u2019t want to do these other things, you know? They\u2019re stressing me out and they\u2019re just I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">that it\u2019s just too much, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I mean, I try to stop and, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not\u2014I know that it\u2019s been getting bigger than it really is, but I just you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: You have, like, a lot going on inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Having these dreams, it\u2019s like what you grappling with\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yea, you know, because I know when I go to this wedding, that\u2019s Friday, Saturday I mean I\u2019ve got to do pleasantries and chit-chat, and I just, aww, I don\u2019t have it in me. But, you know, what do you do? If I don\u2019t go, you know, it doesn\u2019t look good you know. It\u2019s not, I mean, umm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I wonder what comes to mind about these dreams?

I always have that mixed feeling about what I\u2019m\u2014you know, I want to be in a really great relationship, but because of my upbringing and my past, and the choices I\u2019ve made and all that shit. I mean, yea, on some level, I so don\u2019t trust women, I don\u2019t\u2014you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561734\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: That feels more like this dream (crosstalk) actually even deeper layers of who women are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: You know what\u2019s really funny? The very next day, no, no two days ago, yesterday, I was on my way home from\u2014I had a pretty nice day yesterday, you know, whatever. On my way home from practice, there\u2019s this one chick who I\u2019ve been kind of hooking up with, you know. She\u2019s, you know, I\u2019ve been blowing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">her off like I\u2019ve been doing lately and all that. So, yesterday, again, she was maybe supposed to come over\u2014I mean it\u2019s just purely like sex. I mean, she\u2019s nice and everything, but it\u2019s just purely sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">And, again, I blew her off, you know. So I felt bad, so on my way home from practice, I was like, hey, you know, know, know, know. Then she\u2014this is like, I don\u2019t think ever happened to me, but she got really petty\u2026I\u2019m like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Petty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yea, you know how, you know the clich\u00e9 thing of women, you get really angry and, you know\u2014I think the best button that the lady can really get a guy is say shit about his penis or something, you know what I mean? I was like, really? Wow! She got really\u2014I don\u2019t know if she was maybe drunk. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">also sounded\u2014something was odd in her text. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Like going for the jugular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yea, that was just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Like she was feeling hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: I mean, I handled it so well. If that was a year ago, even six months ago maybe, I could have (swishing sound) you know, at least for a few days or something, you know. I didn\u2019t shoot anything back. I thought of a lot of things I could say back, but I was, like, wow! That\u2019s really petty. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">like, thanks for letting me know who you really are. That\u2019s cool, but I was, like, you know, I feel kind of bad for her. I don\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s a lot of anger there, you know? But, I was like, take care. I don\u2019t know what to tell you.

I mean, you\u2019re upset that you\u2019re not getting it from me. You know, and now this? You see that\u2019s why\u2014and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">unfortunately there\u2019s truth to some of that you know? I don\u2019t know any guy, even the shittiest guy I know\u2014that just, we wouldn\u2019t, you know what I mean? We don\u2019t do that. By the way, your fat, you know what I mean? Or just, you know, your tits suck.

Like I can\u2019t, just like, yep, everything\u2019s great. I mean, it\u2019s friendships. You\u2019ve got to talk, right? I started a coaching bit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">It\u2019s almost like exhausting to explain all these things, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Uh-hum.

You know when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">it would feel invasive, that there is a kind of taking something?

It\u2019s just now finally finding a way to  embrace it and, well <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">recognize it first of all, but embrace it and realize that all of these things are just part of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: This is all one big project, you know?

I was like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: Yea, it\u2019s like it\u2019s perfect you know. That way, I\u2019m not being a poser or  like I\u2019m ashamed of my name and come up with some fancy names. It\u2019s my dad\u2019s name, you know, so it\u2019s cool. And it just so happens to help people not be douches trying to pronounce Lampard (ph) you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: Did I say it right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Think I said it right? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: Said what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: Lampard (ph) (chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: Oh, yea, yea, yea. Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">THERAPIST: So it feels to you like (inaudible) that is more of you becoming yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: It does, yea, yea. It is liberating for sure. I think it\u2019s awesome to change your name, kind of. I never even thought about it. It\u2019s kind of awesome, but it\u2019s got to be right. You know what I mean? To me, it\u2019s almost like a tattoo. I don\u2019t need a million tattoos. This is just something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201371\">meant something to me. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s for show business, or this or  that. It helps with all that stuff, but yea, it\u2019s like distancing. You know what I mean? It\u2019s like I\u2019m still Brian (ph), our name is that is in our family, but yea, it was a distancing thing. Like, you know what? No. I\u2019ve always <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201372\">been kind of the gray sheep, doing things my own way, and let\u2019s formalize that (chuckles) you know? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s part of the doing things your own way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yea, I mean everything now is Brian (sp?). I mean I think at some point I do need to legally make it legit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s even on your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: Everything is Brian (sp?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">CLIENT: Oh you didn\u2019t know that? Oh yea, yea, yea. Once I did the book and now  the band, it\u2019s like, I mean, that\u2019s who I am. Yea, yea. No. When I introduce myself to people, it\u2019s Brian (sp?) I don\u2019t say Lampard (ph) .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20142-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20142-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561734\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Umm. I did not know that. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: Yea. No it\u2019s not just like a nom de plume or some douche (crosstalk). Naa. No. (pause) I mean that\u2019s why it feels good. It wasn\u2019t even a thought. Once the book was, it was like, yea, that\u2019s it. Like I said, it\u2019s not Brian Smith or something. Van obviously has no connection to Lampard (sp?) but <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201471\">it\u2019s my family. You know what I mean, that\u2019s not, you know. See, legally, probably what I would do is just make Lampard (sp?) like some kind of middle name. I don\u2019t know, just find a way that it\u2019s there. Yea, I had to go and do like a doing business as you know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s a matter of fact and it feels good, but then you get this Donna (sp?) in your dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what that was about. That was really fucking scary. I did not like that. A hypochondriac doesn\u2019t like shit like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: What about panic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what, yea, when I talked to Bethany (sp?) yesterday, she was like, oh yea, like I mean, panic attacks and dreams and stuff. Yea. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">I do know that these are all secondary, the peanut butter, but they don\u2019t help. You know what I mean? I don\u2019t have a really nice mattress. I\u2019m not down playing anything, I\u2019m just saying that cannot help these things (chuckles). You know what I mean? It would have probably happened anyway, no doubt, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201511\">but you know. I have a bad habit of having snacks late at night.  I\u2019m awake, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">Yea, I know, definitely these are dreams of some kind of, I\u2019m like looking for something or I\u2019m like going somewhere, but I don\u2019t know where, (inaudible) but it\u2019s not. Yea, it\u2019s weird. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: You wonder yourself if it really has to do with something happening here in this process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: Yea, I think there is just stuff that, obviously, you know, that\u2019s getting stirred. I think more and more, I think a lot of what it is, is even I\u2019m not aware of it day in and day out, I think I\u2019m, on a gut level, way more connected now to when I was a kid and stuff that happened. I can\u2019t articulate <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201571\">it all or even know what it is exact\u2014but I think that\u2019s a lot of what it is I think. You know what I mean? I think. On some kind of level, you know? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">(deep breath) (tapping)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">I told you about that nonprofit thing I\u2019m going to do, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m definitely doing that. (tapping)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s for literacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: Yea, I even like found a Cheshire literacy program thing that the library does, so that could be one of the things I can either donate or I can donate time or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">Then there\u2019s that Children\u2019s Room. Remember that? You know I\u2019ve always wanted to be involved with that, so that could be something where a certain portion I can give to that or do like free something, go there and lead some kind of workshop or something like that. So there\u2019s a few things like that, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: To help traumatized kids, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">CLIENT: Yea, they\u2019re like trauma, yea, grieving, and then the Cheshire thing is for immigrants learning English, reading, this and that, yea. Then there\u2019s a school (sp?). I could do something there, some Cheshire. This is a lot, you know. I already talked to my friend who is a lawyer. So, I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201691\">you can make money, right? (chuckles) It\u2019s a nonprofit. He was like, well yea, you\u2019re being paid as a, you know. Obviously you can\u2019t get donations and then do nothing with the donations and just pocket it, but as long as\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561734\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: You mean it\u2019s a salary (crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yea, he was like, for a nonprofit, people make a lot of\u2014you know, the executives, people in charge. They do well, you know. It\u2019s like your giving your time and effort to make all that happen, so he was like that\u2019s fine, you know. As long as then you\u2019re giving time and part of that money then, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">Yea, I think it\u2019s going to be really good, connect that to, you know, the life coaching thing. I can do workshops on writing and mixing creative writing with grief with, you know how  we deal with our memory, you know stuff that can help people, you know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">Yea, I think the thing is it\u2019s a lot. You know what I mean? It\u2019s just a lot. It\u2019s all good, so I can\u2019t be like, well I just won\u2019t do this, I won\u2019t do that. I mean, if you\u2019re going to go for it, you\u2019ve got to go for it you know. But I think it does mean that it\u2019s going to take me time to\u2014between this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201711\">you know what I mean. If I was just doing that stuff that\u2019s one thing, but\u2026(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">THERAPIST: I also think we can look at it as, you know, your association is now (inaudible) to the nonprofit. You know, it\u2019s like an external counterpart and maybe safer, more intellectual counterpart to be thinking about to the internal counterparts of how you can help a traumatized, grieving kid (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201731\">to do anything and that\u2019s the question that\u2019s hovering right  now. How do you trust again, how do we reach that kid. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">CLIENT: (deep breath) Yea, I guess, really at the end of the day, a lot of this is about trust, I guess. When you really whittle it down. It\u2019s like trusting others, trusting myself. It\u2019s just all about trust, yea. What makes me feel so much better is that, that is a good kind of counterbalance. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201751\">just now, when I was at Levi\u2019s on my laptop, the mass poetry thing is going on, the (inaudible) or whatever. So I got an e-mail from them, their newsletter  whatever. \u201cThis is our future poet of the month\u201d or whatever. I was like, how does this shit work? It was a shady fucking\u2014probably a very nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201752\">person, but the poem they had was awful, or at the best, mediocre. So I was like, you know what, so I just wrote to the woman whose e-mail (inaudible), I was like, I\u2019m just curious how do you guys select. I just get a very brief thing about music. I was just curious, looking forward to the festival, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201753\">whatever. That little thing is a big deal. You know what I mean? That\u2019s a very big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: Without making a big deal of it to me. It\u2019s a big deal exactly because I\u2019m not making a big deal, you know what I mean? Just a very quick e-mail. I\u2019m not thinking about it. I  don\u2019t really give a shit either way. But it is about being assertive in a healthy way, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s what not making a big deal out of it part, but doesn\u2019t it letting yourself do that, mean also it\u2019s a little moment when walking out on a limb, like putting yourself out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">CLIENT: And also saying \u201cI genuinely trust that I deserve,\u201d or whatever, why not, that I belong, who the fuck are these people? The same with the nonprofit. Same with the life coaching, so yea, a lot of this stuff is finally about\u2014yea I know I can get a real estate license or I can work in an office; <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D1\">but, a lot of it now is like, wait a second, it\u2019s exactly what I want to help other people do. It\u2019s like, umm, now I feel like this is way closer to my potential and the things I  genuinely care about than just willy nilly trying to make money here and there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2017C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561734\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">THERAPIST: I think this question of trust in others, trust in yourself is embedded in the conversation we had about\u2014I don\u2019t know if you remember, it was while back, about math and how you were pursuing it and was it half ass and what does it mean that you could not go full force into that or not. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F1\">know, all of these questions are lingering. What if you asked for it and you get bitten with a no. What if they say yes, and can you trust yourself if you didn\u2019t follow through on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">CLIENT: Right, right. I don\u2019t know what this means, but lately, ever since we talked about it, I haven\u2019t even thought about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s something too. I mean I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">CLIENT: Maybe next year, I\u2019ll be like, wow, it would have been really nice if I  finished it, but I think that\u2019s all it will be. You know what I mean? Like, yea, that would have been nice if I could have just done that, but whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s part of it. If you were able to talk about all of the different feelings more and then come to terms with actually, it\u2019s not that important (chuckles) to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">CLIENT: Yea, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Then you get to pursue what is important to you.
