So, and after I saw you two weeks ago, I went to see Micah. And as I was talking to her, she was writing everything down. And she\u2019s like, \u201cThese are all symptoms of depression. Take your medicine. Stop drinking,\u201d you know. And, you know, I did kind of focus a little more. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">You know, we kind of made it so the only thing I have to take at night is the Klonopin, you know. And I think maybe some of my feeling not so well was due to the inconsistency of taking the medicines. And, you know, towards the end, you know, I don\u2019t really remember what happened in the middle of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">week. But, you know, like Friday I just\u2014I don\u2019t know. Just, you know, stressed and, you know, frustrated and the kids came over. And I just\u2014really rough time with the kids. And, you know, I was with them forever. At the hockey rink and, you know, I forget Lucille\u2019s snacks. You know, just all this shit <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">was going on. And I kind of took a nap on Saturday. What did we do? Oh, it was Valentine\u2019s Day, so this wasn\u2019t\u2014no. I\u2019m thinking of something different. This was Valentine\u2019s Day. And things were actually\u2014I don\u2019t know. I mean I guess I was probably\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk 00:01:51) this past Friday or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. This was the past\u2014that was like this past Friday. But the Friday before that was Valentine\u2019s Day. And, you know, I definitely wasn\u2019t 100%, you know. I know Marcia kind of sensed it, you know. But went to dinner, you know. Really nice restaurant in Hartford. And we met up with a friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">of hers. We had a really good time. And then we got back to the hotel and, you know, first thing I was trying to do\u2014I\u2019ve got the\u2014my little blue tooth speaker was to hook her phone up to it, you know. I\u2019ve had problems in the past and now I kind of realize that my problem is I got to unhook my phone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">first, you know. So, I was getting frustrated with that. And so, she takes her phone and starts playing it out of the speaker in the phone. And it was like this song, you know\u2014one of these crazy ladies belting it out song. So, she\u2019s like belting it out. And she doesn\u2019t have that great of voice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And, you know, just starting to get to me a little bit. And went to the\u2014we\u2019re\u2014somehow we ended up in the bathroom. And just was even more tinny. And I\u2019m asking her to turn it off, you know. I don\u2019t know\u2014just\u2014and I haven\u2019t figure out yet that I needed to unpair my phone. And I don\u2019t remember specifically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">but there just\u2014it seems like there\u2019s times where, you know, I ask her to stop doing something, right? And just kind of ignores me, you know. And I started feeling like that. And, you know, so she\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter,\u201d whatever, you know. And I don\u2019t\u2014you know, just\u2014it just started snowballing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">into this really big thing, you know. So, then we had champagne and she pops the champagne. She\u2019s going to go outside and smoke the cigarette. So, she, you know, pours a glass and walks out. And we haven\u2019t\u2014I haven\u2019t even had any yet. I\u2019m like, you know\u2014it\u2019s like once we got back to the room it was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">I kind of wasn\u2019t there to some degree. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">You know, she\u2019s singing to herself, you know. You know, but I think it was one of these things where, you know, we were at a bar and she was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not even buzzed or,\u201d you know. And then she had like an espresso martini and I think that\u2019s all she wrote. But, you know, she kept kind of bringing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">it back to the music thing. And so, it was like, \u201cWould you let it go? Let it go?\u201d You know, just she kept going back to it and it just kept snowballing and getting worse. And it got to the point that I really just mentally could not let it go. And she\u2019s getting really pissed. She starts saying things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">like I\u2019m trying to use reverse psychology on her. I wasn\u2019t. You know, it wasn\u2019t even reverse\u2014you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">So, I think she\u2019s feeling frustrated with trying to argue with me which I understand. I\u2019m trying to argue with (inaudible). And then we\u2019re sitting there and all of a sudden, you know, she brings up what happened, you know, a couple weeks ago, you know, where I took off, you know. And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">you bring that up,\u201d you know. And she gets upset with me for me even asking that question like I should know. So, now it turns into how can I not see all the horrible things I\u2019m doing, you know. So, it\u2019s like now I\u2019m basically\u2014there\u2019s nothing to do because everything she says she\u2019s not going to tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200172\">me what\u2019s wrong, what I\u2019ve done. She\u2019s just going to tell me I\u2019m an asshole, you know. And it really, at one point, you know, way out of hand. She was screaming at me, you know. Psychotic, crazy. You need to get off these meds. Just going. Really hurtful things, you know. I don\u2019t even think she really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200173\">remembers what she said, but I basically stopped talking to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">She went out maybe to have another cigarette. And she came back in. She laid down. She\u2019s like, you know, \u201cI\u2019m head over heels in love with you,\u201d and then comes the half-hearted apology like I\u2019m a professional at with. And she\u2019s like, \u201cI am sorry though I\u2019m not sure what I did,\u201d you know and then just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">starts going on about, you know, me being an asshole again or something like that. And I didn\u2019t even\u2014I said nothing. And she\u2019s like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say?\u201d And I said nothing because I\u2019m like there\u2019s nothing I can say that can make this better. It can only make it worse, you know. So, she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">like, \u201cWell, I figured, you know,\u201d whatever. And then, you know, when we woke up and it seemed to a\u2014a little, you know, she\u2019s sobered up, I guess. And I think a little more like it wasn\u2019t fatal or anything like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">And but it really was kind of bothering me what she had said to me, you know. And she was kind of picking up that, you know, I was upset. And finally when I left, I just kind of texted her. I was like, \u201cYou said some really hurtful things.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">but you went way with the magnitude compared to what I may have done and what you did.\u201d And I don\u2019t even think she\u2014like I said, that she really knows what she did. And so that kind of, you know, you know, I was bummed out. You know what? I did go back and hang out. And, you know, it was a little, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">know\u2014I don\u2019t know. But I was getting busy. And, you know, so I just\u2014it just, like, just sort of general depression. I wasn\u2019t even really fixating on that. Like I really didn\u2019t even start thinking about that again until this past weekend, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D\">You just kind of even\u2014and that\u2019s when the kids and everything started bothering me. And I was really just, you know\u2014and then I went over there Saturday night. And it\u2019s like flipping a switch, you know. It really is. And I was fine. Went and saw a show at the House of Blues and it was Jill\u2019s 50 year <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D1\">birthday party at WFW. Great time. I was pretty hung over the next day. I pretty much spent the whole day in bed. She spent three quarters of the day in bed, you know. And I don\u2019t know what happened, but I woke up Monday morning. And this is a Monday morning where I\u2019m usually like\u2014you know it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D2\">I got a state plan. You know, I got shit on my mind. I got shit to do. I woke up and there\u2019s no anxiety. I was motivated, you know, and it felt good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">And, you know, I totally thought this thing. Thinking that I could buy all of these papers in housing court in Concord. But they\u2019re only in Concord on Wednesday and it took like\u2014I got to go to Merrimac and then I got to serve the landlord at his (ph) you know. There\u2019s no fucking way I\u2019m going to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F1\">all this done. You know, and so, I called Gail, you know, to take the kids or whatever. But no anxiety, no, you know. And same thing today. I woke up, you know, about 5:00 a.m. and I went to the bathroom. Went back to lay down. My alarm was going to go off at 6:00 and I just thought a little bit about work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">And instead of ruminating, I said, \u201cYou know, maybe I better get up, beat traffic.\u201d And I got back to the apartment and was very productive this morning. I kept amazing myself how early it was and how much time\u2014because usually I\u2019m up. I got to get seven things to do and five minutes out the door, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">know. And so, there\u2019s been just a normalcy change. Now, I think I know what part of that is. So, I started some paid search, you know, my website, (inaudible 00:10:43). When you Google in addition to the different attorney websites, their directory comes up. And the real value is being number one, connected <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200212\">to their directory, so people going from their directory, a very popular site, you know, your website. That kind of stuff is really good. But what I think I wasn\u2019t capturing was the people who weren\u2019t going to the website. They were just seeing the name, what they did, and picking the phone number. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200213\">So, for very short money, I mean less than $100 I\u2019m paying for landlord\/tenant, trusts, and maybe probate, you know. Cheap words that when people Google that and they go through the directory\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: Google AdWord?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: No. This is\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk 00:11:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. This is by laws. You know, people Googling\u2014what people Google to get to their site. So, they take that information and give you what you\u2019re looking for in that directory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So, somebody goes find law probate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Probate. You know, here\u2019s a perfect example. Plymouth trust attorney, you know, (inaudible 00:12:07) attorney, you know. That blue box they might even have the payment on top, but one of the first is going to be the final directory. They click on it and there\u2019s going to be a list of the Plymouth <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">or at least the attorneys of Plymouth. Now the top five spots are paid for spots that are red thing. You click to go to their website and they\u2019ve got something special. These areas not all five of those are sold. And because I cover from Pembroke to Plymouth they\u2019ve got this second tier which basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">puts you underneath that, but it shades your name. Now if I were to do this in real estate or some of these other more expensive things, because I\u2019m not that in town guy\u2014the guy in Essex they say he gets like 70 a month. You know, how many of those are\u2014I get a ton of\u2014you know, probably three or four <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D3\">telemarketing calls a day from my website. I was like, \u201cYeah. You know, what the fuck?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">So, pretty much I think this went live on Friday. I\u2019ve had it Saturday and Sunday now, but every other day I\u2019ve had at least one inquiry with landlord\/tenant and estate planning. The first people that called me hired me. They\u2019re on section eight, so, you know, I\u2019m kind of hoping for attorney\u2019s fees <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">here. But I think there\u2019s a good shot. And I think a lot of what the\u2014you know, and I basically have kind of found a niche as landlord\/tenant that\u2019s not being satisfied with the Internet, you know. And I think the tenants it\u2019s really like talking to them about their problem maybe meet with them for an <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F2\">hour, talking with them on the phone for an hour. Tell them what their options are going to be. And even if at that moment, they don\u2019t need me, you know. Would they take the self-help or some\u2014you know, the\u2014the fact that they\u2019re calling suggests that the landlord coughed up a security deposit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">That there\u2019s things that they can hire me and, you know, I would get attorney\u2019s fees. So, it\u2019s kind of a like a personal injury kind of, you know, win some, lose some I think kind of thing I think some (inaudible) in the bag. And, obviously in settlements my fee is going to be part of the bargaining <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">chip. But a lot of these cases are $1,000, $1,500 worth of time anyways. And I get a call from this guy who\u2019s doing a mass health application for this company\u2014with this company. And they need a durable power of attorney. So, he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, the company\u2019s like a (inaudible 00:14:59) ram. Do you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200312\">something to recommend in Plymouth?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">And what I think the guy did was went on Google and put Plymouth whatever and up came me and gave him my name because the number from the website. I (crosstalk). And it was easy, you know. He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the guy,\u201d you know. \u201cWell, I know him real well,\u201d and so, you know, kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200331\">of along with it a little bit. So, it\u2019s really I mean this isn\u2019t just\u2014this isn\u2019t a small thing. I\u2019m like busy on the verge of going to flight out, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Sails and everything, you know. You know the purchase and sales side is just picking up. And I think, you know\u2014I mean if I got an inquiry. I\u2019ve had a couple that, you know, haven\u2019t connected. But I think, you know, the ability to lay the groundwork with these tenants and ultimately, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">if I can get the chance to meet and talk with them and to explain to them about the security deposit. You know, it\u2019s kind of the same thing with my direct marketing to listings. You know, it\u2019s when they get they offer that\u2019s when hopefully they\u2019re going to hire me and the same thing here, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">You know, when your landlord screws up your security deposit at the apartment they have, they probably have already done it. If you want, I can pay it now. Which I\u2019m meeting with one on Tuesday. And she had a lease and the landlord took a security deposit. They renewed it and the landlord took the security <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">deposit on renewal, used it towards damages, and it made her give another deposit. Can\u2019t do that. So, this old lady who\u2019s going to be\u2014(inaudible 00:16:48) lady who I know is going to be stubborn. So, we\u2019re going to get like a big, chunk of money and attorney\u2019s fees on this one. I\u2019m going to own that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200392\">house in Waltham, you know. So, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">CLIENT: So, I think that has\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Like there\u2019s a lot of potential there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. And really it\u2019s probably because, you know, this was happening all last week. And you know, it\u2019s kind of one these pinching yourself kinds of things. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been waiting for this to happen forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk 00:17:14) like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: I think one of the first things that clicked was I had to\u2014like I have to local calls, you know. And I\u2019ve got to get back to people quickly and I\u2019ve got to be sort of\u2014kind of like with e-mails I can\u2014I got to be kind of gentle because I can\u2019t, you know, ask them questions about their situation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">I can\u2019t probe. But, you know, for the money I\u2019m spending I mean, you know, the words are like 30\u2014for the three spots\u2014words I\u2019m buying 80, 90 bucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: And every year it\u2019s going to go down. So, I think that just kind of sunk in yesterday of like boom, you know. You know, it\u2019s one of those things the more productive you get the more, you know\u2014so, I was struggling with doing titles and getting work done and wah, wah. Just every day (crosstalk 00:18:12).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And the more you\u2014the more work you get the better you know what you\u2019re doing. The easier it is to get it done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, thinking about things to do to sort of make things work a little easier for me. And my motivation is way up. And, you know, I had a\u2014I can remember a small claims case out in Ware District Court. And he showed up late and it was dismissed. So, we filed a motion to dismiss. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">I went back out there. And part of\u2014you know, he said that he had to get his granddaughter to the bus, traffic. You know, the distance from Sturbridge to Ware at 8:00 in the morning. Seriously though, this was western mass through (inaudible 00:19:03). Those things get pretty good, you know. (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">and I was trying to get to Holland, you know. So, or Hadley (ph). No parking, you know. And then there was the suggestion\u2014you know, he\u2019s a disabled veteran.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">And the suggestion was that the disability made it difficult for him to get around the courthouse. I\u2019m expecting this (inaudible 00:19:32), you know. I\u2019m walking down these guys\u2014behind these guys on the stairs. He was slightly little limp whatever. No problem going down the stairs. Now I probably should <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">have known better, but, you know, you really need\u2014you know, big caution. There\u2019s these guidelines that come out and they caution these magistrates. You know, don\u2019t remove these dismissals lightly, you know. But it\u2019s a local guy. It\u2019s an older guy. He was a disabled veteran that she really didn\u2019t like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">where I was going, you know, because, you know, these excuses were not, you know\u2014they\u2019re basically foreseeable. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">It\u2019s foreseeable that you got to take your daughter to the bus. It\u2019s foreseeable that you\u2014you know. She didn\u2019t want to listen to any of that which is, you know, I should have expected that. But I think I was coming off a little rough. But, you know, I made sure to mention the part and she kind of was, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">you know, pulling me in a little bit. And I made the mention of like, \u201cWell, you know, I saw this guy walk down the stairs. And, you know,\u201d\u2014she understood that I was making the argument that that wasn\u2019t the reason he was late. He didn\u2019t take that. Now this is a guy who blows up because he had to wait <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200512\">three hours to get his room. That\u2019s what this is all about at his timeshare. Waiting to get his room for three hours. Key doesn\u2019t work. All these little things that don\u2019t work. Not getting the satisfaction he wants from whomever he talks to other than I\u2019m sorry and some drink tickets. He wants to talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200513\">to the CEO. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">So, I knew I had to poke him, you know. And I was going to go up and hand him my attorney\u2019s fees, my affidavit of attorney\u2019s fees. But when I was walking down the stairs behind him I\u2019m like\u2014you know. And so, he went nuts. (laughter) And she, you know, granted the motion and so, you know, let\u2019s have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">the trial. So, you know, she did a couple more motions and we came back and we did the trial. And that guy went through. And just, you know, they had\u2014they brought no evidence. They submitted nothing, you know. They want $7,000. They want everyone\u2019s claim tickets in the party, you know. They don\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200532\">have the price of the ticket in writing, you know. The contract. You know, we have a contract. You know, by contract we were supposed to have a room at 4:00. I\u2019m like, \u201cMadam Clerk, can they provide this contract? It\u2019s just not enforceable promise.\u201d You know they promise him a room at 4:00, but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200533\">unenforceable, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">I didn\u2019t want to say well, you know, bad customer service, but you know. I\u2019m like hey these people live down here 15 years. One bad time, you know. Let all the sales force notes and everything like that, you know. And every so often, you know\u2014first of all, you know, during the motion, he turned and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200551\">was like looking right at me, you know, about the whole veteran thing. And so, I\u2019m looking at him, you know, with a straight face. And, you know, just waiting. I knew the clerk at some point was going to tell him to stop talking to me. She did and I was going to ask her to tell him to stop talking to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200552\">me. But she said, \u201cYou cannot talk. You can only talk to me.\u201d And but also he would find little points all throughout to bring this up. And, you know, I thought she just even had blown off the attorney\u2019s fees. I was going to ask for them again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">And, you know, it was stuff like, you know, they\u2019re just burying themselves\u2014you know they never even called us. You know, write them a note on salesforce.com. They\u2019re on the do not call registry, you know, which they do still call him. But the magistrates like, \u201cYou guys are on the do not call, so you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">got some special system,\u201d you know. So, you know. So, she started, you know, number one saying how easily he, you know, was getting angry. And she came back about the attorney\u2019s fees. And he (inaudible 00:23:37). I can\u2019t remember the word he used, you know. But this guy is going to, you know, whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200572\">in open court about me and he has no respect for disabled veterans. And his partner was like, you know, \u201cYou don\u2019t know his disability. You\u2019re not a doctor. He was attacked by a serial killer in a VA hospital.\u201d And both of them were just going nuts.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20059\">And I\u2019m just sitting there. I\u2019ve got my eyes occasionally connecting with the clerk just saying, \u201cThings couldn\u2019t be going any better.\u201d (laughter) And when it came up to attorney\u2019s fee and they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat? Why would we have to pay,\u201d you know. And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, you guys were late for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200591\">the hearing. His client did have to spend money for his time.\u201d So, they fucking lost it. It was awesome. It was beautiful. I didn\u2019t want to look around the courtroom and, you know\u2014I just\u2014you know, I didn\u2019t want to look bad to the magistrate. I didn\u2019t want her to know I was enjoying it. And so, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200592\">I made the arguments how they hadn\u2019t submitted anything. Blah, blah, blah, blah. And I have a feeling ultimately she\u2019s probably going to\u2014I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that she\u2019s going to give some attorney\u2019s fees probably knock down what I asked for. Probably craft some way to make an offset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B\">Well, maybe a couple hundred dollars off their vacation. A couple hundred dollars in attorney\u2019s fees. You know, she might do that. She might not. I don\u2019t know because the way they hand they handle dismissal hearings and the way they handle the actual trial are two different things. You know, they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B1\">pretty, you know\u2014yes, they\u2019re (inaudible). Yes, they\u2019re locals, but you still have to make your case, you know. And I just don\u2019t think they did. And she\u2019s got to issue findings too. So, we got outside the courtroom. And no less than six times and I never made contact with them. Eye contact. Sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005B2\">allowed conversation of what an asshole I was. And then they were down here and as I went up by the stairs, you know, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou had no fucking respect for disabled veterans.\u201d (laughter) I kept going, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D\">But the thing that popped into my mind was to stop, turn around, and say, \u201cMy dad is MIA in Vietnam,\u201d which I know I could have pulled off. But, you know, I didn\u2019t need to be mean to him, you know. I was just showing the clerk how these guys react. And, you know, it was just a\u2014I was handed a meatball <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D1\">walking down behind these guys, you know. And I couldn\u2019t have imagined it going that well, you know. I mean it\u2019s always going to come out. The money didn\u2019t matter, but I think it really\u2014when you add in the fact that they submitted nothing to prove their damages, you know. \u201cWell, their contractor contractions, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2005D2\">contract, contract, contract.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m a clerk. Where\u2019s the contract,\u201d you know. So, that went well. And I don\u2019t know. I just self-confidence. And, you know\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well, and also it sounds like you were effective. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I feel like, you know, the landlord\/tenant is an area that I still need to learn some things and get some things\u2014get some systems in place. I think it\u2019s an area that isn\u2019t crowded like no one wants to put up with these tasks. You know, you\u2014there\u2019s going to be a lot of crap calls. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200611\">the nice thing is as I get busy I can be picky, you know. And, you know, so I remembered there was\u2014when I was going over to Marcia when we were first dating that, you know, I\u2019d get up. I would beat traffic, you know. I would just and recently it\u2019s like I\u2014you know, even getting up at 6:00, I just\u2014I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200612\">stuck in traffic. It\u2019s like all this wasted time, you know. Storms and, you know, I was going over there and not really getting work done and that I should have. And, you know, today getting up at five. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20063\">You know, I\u2019m like I can do this, you know. Yeah. I went to bed at 11:00 last night. We just hung out and watched all the crappy reality TV shows. You know, I was there working. You know, she was at work when I got there, so I got some work done. And busy as fucking how, you know. A couple things she\u2014I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200631\">notice she\u2019s hitting on is number one I think the\u2014I kind of let go her anger and all these hurtful things she said to me. And maybe I\u2019m not as so hurt about them. Sort of looking at the perspective of living with someone who has depression, you know. But I don\u2019t\u2014as much as she thinks she understands, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200632\">she doesn\u2019t, you know. Her nephew, you know, may have bipolar. Checking him into, you know, the who who house doesn\u2019t give you a PhD. Maybe for you it did, but, you know, you probably have your dad and your brother all locked up or something. Hard earned cash. So, (laughter) I lost my train of thought. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200633\">So, you know, and the same thing was going on with Jess, you know. And sort of a tangent of that is\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20065\">THERAPIST: You mean when\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20067\">CLIENT: Here\u2019s the example. So, you know, she\u2019s kind of asking me why\u2014it\u2019s in her text blog, you know. You know, I was frustrated, upset, whatever, you know. And so, she\u2014when I got over there, she asked me about it. And I was like, \u201cOh, you know, the kids were,\u201d\u2014you know, and it\u2019s not like I can come <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200671\">out and sit here for 45 minutes and boom, boom, go through all this shit that\u2019s bothering me. Like one or two things comes out and it was the kids. And, you know, she just muttered under her breath. \u201cThey\u2019re kids,\u201d you know. Like, you know, what\u2019s your fucking problem? You know, and the other thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200672\">when I talked about work, she\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s life,\u201d you know. Not to me but kind of, you know. And at first that really bothered me. And maybe that I\u2019m okay being bother by it. But I understand how she doesn\u2019t understand, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20069\">THERAPIST: I follow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B\">CLIENT: But she\u2019s not being completely unreasonable. And then I probably have to, you know, work this out with her in some way. And it came up yesterday like when I cancelled with the kids. You know, she wanted to know whether I was going to still have dinner with the kids or she was going to make dinner. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B1\">But and I think there was this thing about, you know, me being not so\u2014maybe this is just self-conscious. But, you know, I don\u2019t have a second thought about trying to make up for not having the kids. I\u2019ll see them Friday, you know. And I think she may have been picking up on that. And it\u2019s only going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B2\">to get worse, you know. I mean I\u2019m\u2014I haven\u2019t used Jess\u2019 office in months and I\u2019ve used it like three times in, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D\">So, and that\u2019s you know\u2014I want to go ahead and sell the condo in Wales because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to need the $1,500 anymore and I want to get rid of it. I mean she wanted to sell it anyways in the spring. It\u2019s a nice referral to Vivian. She\u2019s giving me a hard time about using Patricia. She doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D1\">understand that\u2014you know, she\u2019s like, you now, Patricia\u2019s website kind of does an estimation value based on, you know, this is all algorithmic, you know. But between like 280 and 290, you know. But when you got a $240,000 in principle, no interest payments, no tax payments, and no condo fee payments, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D2\">and no assessments like we\u2019ll probably get $10,000. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2006F\">Since 2010, that 240\u2014I mean we\u2014we owe $70,000 on top of our $500,000 principle. And that\u2019s just a first mortgage and then you got to throw in a broker\u2019s commission. I want to use a specialist. S, you got to throw in their commission, you know. I\u2019m trying to explain to her that the price we sell it for <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006F1\">doesn\u2019t make a difference. What makes the difference is where is our negotiation with the lender as far as who gets paid what and what gets written off? And we\u2019ve already declared bankruptcy, so the notes are unenforceable. You know, the debts are gone. So, it\u2019s just a matter of them satisfying their <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2006F2\">liens. And, you know, she just\u2014it\u2019s just another thing where she doesn\u2019t understand. And I\u2019m not even that sad about it. Not normally where I would (inaudible 00:33:13), you know. And so, it\u2019s, you know. I mean\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20071\">THERAPIST: It does seem like the work is going to be part of it. I mean getting more business, having this\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20073\">CLIENT: Having a reason to wake up and take a shower because I got to meet with a client. You know, putting on slacks instead of\u2014and having closings, meeting, you know. I got another closing tonight, you know. Just I don\u2019t know. And this is just the start of it, you know. I know this is just the start of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20075\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. It kind of sounds like you found a niche with the landlord\/tenant stuff. So, I imagine it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s just a good few weeks either. But something that\u2019s really on the way up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. And this is\u2014this just came, so this, you know\u2014all this great feeling was before this. But, you know, there\u2019s\u2014let\u2019s see. (tongue clicking) So, this is, you know, the mortgage guys in Beverly. The one guy who came to the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20079\">THERAPIST: The tip? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B\">CLIENT: The (inaudible) tip and, you know. He just doesn\u2019t have it. You know, I had him act as a witness for a state plan yesterday. And he didn\u2019t even bring a business card down, you know. To dress up, you know. And it\u2019s another great thing that happened is, you know, I get these witnesses. So, I sent <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B1\">out a mass letter to all the\u2014my contacts in Pembroke and around and financial planners just to let them know I\u2019m doing this. And so, I\u2019ve had a witness brigade. So, I\u2019m thinking oh, maybe one or two people will respond. Overwhelmed by how many people are going to help me out just being a witness. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B2\">they see a chance to meet another professional and a client, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007D\">So, you know, one of the people I invited is, you know, Karl. And he\u2019s always about business partners. He\u2019s really big on the\u2014he throws parties and he\u2019s got his clubhouse. And he wants to do bocce. (inaudible 00:35:24), \u201cGold Coast is running a 100% based referral business. I love introducing my partners <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007D1\">to each other to see if they have the chemistry to work together. And look at it this way. The more people involved on the team the easier it is to keep the referral volume going. Wouldn\u2019t you agree? The (inaudible 00:35:41) that\u2019s the closing tonight was referred into me by Lyle Evans (ph). That is <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007D2\">one of the most networked, energetic, and successful business partners that I have. Would you kindly allow me to introduce him to you over coffee? By way of career and business banker with Eastern? But Lyle would do well with whatever it is he chooses to learn about and represent.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007D3\">that means, but early morning venue is best. Late lunch perhaps. And we are okay travelling to your preferred coffee shop. So, it\u2019s like, you know, this is something that\u2019s been in the groundwork that I\u2019ve been laying. So, just all of a sudden just, you know. I figure in a couple of months I might even <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007D4\">see the top of the hole. Start paying you. I\u2019ve given the go ahead for my office, you know. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going to get the money from. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007F\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20081\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve got money coming in. To put my cabinets in and, you know. I don\u2019t think Bruce\u2019s going to charge me much if anything to do the work. You know, that was really the big expense. You know, the IKEA cabinets are, you know. That\u2019s really going to be my big expense, now. But I think I\u2014you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200811\">all these little things I\u2019ve got to do. I\u2019ve got to look more professional now. People coming in from Salem, you know. And, yeah. I think it\u2019s just, you know, routine. Showers, brushing teeth, you know. All this, you know, come together. You know, just\u2014it\u2019s all the work really, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20083\">THERAPIST: I hope you (inaudible 00:37:33) this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it\u2014it\u2019s uncanny. It\u2019s every fucking day I\u2019m getting an inquiry. So, if real estate blows up again, I don\u2019t think I would even\u2014I\u2019d probably in business would explode because of, you know\u2014I\u2019d be well entrenched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s been a long time. That\u2019s really neat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, and you know the relationship with the guy, the new guy, seems to be going okay. And got some Frisbee players buying properties as usual. And, you know, it\u2019s funny because I was thinking yesterday. You know, it\u2019s like Jim, the guy who doesn\u2019t think to bring a business card. It\u2019s funny. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200891\">And I\u2019m like, you know her, because I didn\u2019t her refi for (inaudible 00:38:33) people or certain people it seems like. So, it\u2019s like\u2014so, but I was thinking I was driving from Merrimac. And I was like, \u201cGod. You know, how can I really,\u201d\u2014you know, because Karl wrote me back saying that he would\u2014him and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200892\">Harry mentioning about Jim. Him and Harry would want to be on my witness brigade I\u2019m calling it. And, you know, I replied back, \u201cGreat.\u201d You know they got\u2014bought these crazy bocce ball or whatever. I need to start practicing for my Memorial Day barbecue. And I\u2019m just like\u2014I\u2019m like what a\u2014just kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200893\">didn\u2019t know how to approach dealing with Karl who\u2019s sending me business, Harry who\u2019s now in the Pembroke BNI (ph), but he\u2019s got the Concord Rotary, which I\u2019ve got my eye on once you can find me a new time slot. We\u2019ve talked about this before, didn\u2019t we? Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008B\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008D\">CLIENT: Maybe we haven\u2019t. What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What do you want?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20091\">CLIENT: Well, Concord Rotary \u2014and I\u2019m not ready for Concord Rotary. But Concord Rotary meets at noon on Tuesdays. So, you know, me getting out of here at 10:00, I\u2019d have to go straight up. You know, just a big chunk that I\u2019m giving up on Thursdays that I can\u2019t Tuesdays as well with a payoff that is <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200911\">much farther down the road. It\u2019s a service group. And but it\u2019s an opportunity to meet other attorneys. And so, I would want to move my meeting with you to a different day or time. I think you even mentioned maybe like 7:00 a.m. on Monday or something stupid like that. Or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562182\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20093\">THERAPIST: Right. I had had an early appointment on Monday. But I can keep booking up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20095\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s no big deal right now because I just\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20097\">THERAPIST: Right.

I looked at this and I said no. Now I\u2019m glad because I\u2019ve got a lot of other balls in the air now, you know. And, you know, hopefully Jess will give me some money for taxes. But, you know, in estate planning the money comes up front. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200991\">landlord\/tenant. Hopefully, like this woman I meet on Tuesday I can get some money from her, you know, up front. And then there\u2019ll be the day that unless they are that Section 8 client that I can just demand. So, we\u2019ll see how long it lasts. Yeah. I mean I think the business, the\u2014will keep coming in. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200992\">When will this start killing me? That\u2019s the, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well, so far it\u2019s making you feel better.

So, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even stressed out about the money. That I have no money, you know. I don\u2019t know if I should feel about this, but one of the things that bothered me about Valentine\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2009D1\">Day was the amount of money I spent. The effort I put into it. I don\u2019t know. We make some reservations. We buy some flowers. I got a little (inaudible 00:42:11) ring, which she\u2019s wearing on this finger.
