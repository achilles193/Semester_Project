Come on in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">[pause 00:00:09 to 00:00:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So, I was thinking more this week about like, what we talked about last week, about kind of like, just working on like, being happy and content with yourself. But (sighs) I still feel like I need some kind of like, technique in order to be able to like, transition into doing that. I was reading <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">an excerpt from a book that someone had written. I don\u2019t know if this is like, a good technique or not, about taking sort of like, moments of happiness that you have in your life and \u201cbottling\u201d them and sort of like, remembering that feeling instead of taking negative stuff that happens, and \u201cbottling\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">that and sort of remembering that, letting that kind of like permeate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">I was thinking about that, because I feel like that\u2019s what I do a lot of. I really dwell on everything that I perceive to be negative (that either happens, or that I perceive to be negative with myself) (therapist responds), instead of taking like, the good things that happen and focusing more on that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">Like, that seems to be a big part of my behavior, is that I\u2019m like, so fixated and looking for something to be wrong, that (sighs) it\u2019s very... Some days, I find it easy to see good, but that\u2019s like on a good day. But most like, on the average day, I fixate on the negative so much. I feel like that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">a big part of what is preventing me from like, moving forward, is just kind of like never being able to get over the negative. Instead of seeing something... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">Well, first of all, it\u2019s seeing (chuckles), seeing things as negatives that might not be. Then it\u2019s also, you know, when something negative happens, I carry that with me and punish myself for it continuously, instead of being able to like, move past it. I feel like that prev ... If something good <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">happened like, say I weighed myself and thought that I weighed a lot. Then something like, really good happened right after that, the weight would affect my entire day or entire week, and it would prevent me from seeing anything else that\u2019s good. So (sighs) I feel like if I could find a way to move <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">past this fixation on negative (chuckles) things and change my thinking a bit, it would help me to be able to feel more positively about myself like, over time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess, in that light, I was thinking about expectations. (client responds) and sort of your expectations about how quickly you\u2019re going to feel better (client affirms). I\u2019m really appreciating and empathizing with the depth and the longevity of the problems that you have, and the difficulties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. (chuckles) Yeah, I mean... I think they\u2019ve been going on for so long. But I\u2019m just trying to think of ways that I can sort of develop habits and make small steps to try to just work through it, try to form new habits that can help me to get out of this negative (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">thinking, because that\u2019s... I mean, that\u2019s a huge part of like, what makes me feel down, and what leads me to eat, I think sometimes, and it\u2019s just this like, overwhelming sense of negativity and failure, because one thing might have happened. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh, I understand! (client affirms) I understand!<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so, it\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I just hear you having expectations that I worry will set yourself up for failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Probably, yeah. (chuckles) Well, that\u2019s what I always do. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: No, I meant that... You know, an interesting, in this... and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll feel about this. I want to talk about it. (client affirms) But in this vein, I was thinking that you\u2019d be a great candidate, if we could figure out the logistics, of (client affirms) coming here twice a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah, that\u2019s a, that will be hard (chuckles) logistically!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I know, but let\u2019s talk about what you need clinic , you know, what you need in terms of your treatment and then (client affirms)... I\u2019d always rather do it that way, and then (client affirms) figure out how the logistics can be worked out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah, so, um... Yeah, I guess I just... it\u2019s (sighs) as I\u2019ve said many times before, it\u2019s hard for me to... (sighs) It\u2019s hard for me how, to figure out how to like, move forward or change unless I have behavior modi , or mental I guess behavior modifications to think about. Like, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">hard for me to... to not have some kind of like, an action plan, because I always have to have a (chuckles) plan. But, and I am being more... I mean, I think I\u2019ve been a lot more reflective lately of like, why I\u2019m doing stuff and what\u2019s going on; but then when I observe it, I need to have a plan for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">like, how to change it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: (pause) Because I know, so... Like, I know that thinking that way is leading to... I know that dwelling on the negative is leading to me feeling down, and not being able to see the good, and all different things like that. So, if it\u2019s something, so that behavior is something that I perceive <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">as bad, and I feel like anything bad has to be changed like, I have to have a way to change it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But if you did, you would have already. (client affirms) (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I think... and that (sighs) I guess what I kind of don\u2019t even, what I don\u2019t necessarily understand is where to start, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you haven\u2019t started?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: A little bit. (therapist responds) Well (sighs) so, I feel like I\u2019ve been a lot more aware of my actions, and more reflective on like, why I\u2019m doing certain things. But then I feel like, \u201cOkay, now I identified them. Time to start conquering.\u201d Like (chuckles), and so... I guess, looking at it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">from a different perspective, I have done a lot, because I\u2019ve been able to really figure out what\u2019s driving things, and figure out why I\u2019m behaving certain ways, but... For me, I always need to have like, action, plan, and (chuckles) and so I feel like, \u201cOkay, well now I\u2019m identifying all this stuff, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">but I know it\u2019s bad and how do I fix it?\u201d It\u2019s... So it\u2019s kind of like, it\u2019s part of my always needing to have a plan for everything and always needing to have the answers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what if you just have no idea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: That\u2019s, that feels really scary (therapist responds) to me. Like... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s sort of like... (pause) I kind of feel... It\u2019s like if you don\u2019t, if I don\u2019t have the answers to something, I feel really lost, and really stressed, I\u2019m really anxious, and really out of, like out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">of control. (therapist responds) Like... it\u2019s sort of like, if I\u2019m taking a test and there is one problem I don\u2019t know, I start to unravel completely and feel totally out of control, because I don\u2019t like not having the answers. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">So... it just, (sighs) it\u2019s something about like... needing (sighs) to feel like, in control, to feel put together. Because if I feel out of control, I feel like I\u2019m broken, or I\u2019m like, ineffective, or like just not like, I\u2019m not the person that I want to be. Because I need to always have everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">together and be, and have like... Like, it goes back to like, me saying how I always have the house clean and I can\u2019t. When it starts to get not clean and I don\u2019t have time, I hate that. I have to clean, because I need to feel like everything is in its place and everything is like, where it needs to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So, in a sense, when we talk about breaking thought patterns, that would be one of the thought patterns you\u2019d have to break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. It\u2019s a (chuckles), it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: That is, that\u2019s an act, right? In your way of thinking about it, that\u2019s actually an anti-action plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, it\u2019s sort of like I (sighs), in almost every single area, I need to have the answers and I need to have control. The one place where I think I can let myself get out of control at times (or I have periods where I get out of control) would be like, with eating. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">something that\u2019s so... it\u2019s so emotional and there is so much tied to it, that even my desire to control everything (chuckles) can\u2019t totally like, come through in that area. Because that\u2019s the one place where I sometimes feel like I allow myself to lose control. It\u2019s like almost as like, an escape type <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Which is a different sort of thing (client affirms) than tolerating uncertainty. (client affirms) Because what you\u2019re describing is a kind of treat, not a going into the mess. (client affirms) It\u2019s sort of going on the side of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Uh-hmm. Yeah, it\u2019s just like... it\u2019s sort of like... I stop thinking and obsessing for a minute and like, eat like, a few slices of pizza and just like... But when I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m not even like, it\u2019s like, my zone out, like I\u2019m not even conscious of what I\u2019m doing. But it\u2019s the only... it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">like, the only time that I guess I have that zone out. Like, it\u2019s the only action I can think of where I just, I\u2019m not like, aware of what I\u2019m doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a reprieve (client responds) from the distress that you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But otherwise, I need in other, all other (chuckles) areas, I need to have the answers and I have to be in control. Everything has to go according to plan. Often it does not go (chuckles) according to plan, because that\u2019s the way life is. Then, it\u2019s almost like what you were saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">like, me setting myself up for failure. So I like make these big elaborate plans, and then nothing really goes according to plan, and then everything is failure then. So, it\u2019s like then everything is negative, everything is wrong, and nothing is good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I really want to try to prevent that happening in here. (client affirms) And so the analogy that came... I\u2019m sorry; I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. The analogy that came to my mind, it\u2019s not a great analogy, but it\u2019s like, say you hurt your knee and you\u2019re limping. Your type of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">solution is, \u201cLet me figure out how not to limp\u201d; not, \u201cHow do I fix my knee?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah (chuckles). Yeah, that\u2019s sort of... I just need to like, fix the sort of like immediate (therapist responds) thing that\u2019s happening, because I need to have all the answers and... And I kind of... What I want to be able to do is to just let go, because it\u2019s so... because then I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">I wouldn\u2019t have to like, go to food as like, having the escape, because I would just let go, like all the time (chuckles). It would be great! But (sighs)... I don\u2019t... I\u2019m sort of scared of what would happen if I let go. (sniffles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Because what could happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Chaos! (therapist responds) And like, I feel like if I just... stopped planning and feeling like I had all this stuff to do, that\u2019s when I feel like, everybody would start getting mad at me, because I wasn\u2019t doing all the great stuff. So like, I feel like if I let my house get messy, then if <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">I had people over, they would judge me because of that. Like, I feel like if I didn\u2019t, you know, send people cards and gifts and different things, they would not like me anymore, or think I wasn\u2019t thinking of them enough. Or like I feel like if I don\u2019t call my parents enough, then they think that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">a bad child or like that I don\u2019t care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">So... I feel like I have to like, keep all of these things up. But then often, I\u2019m doing all this stuff, and I\u2019m sacrificing myself to do it. So I\u2019m like, putting off a workout (that I may not really want to do, but that, you know, would be good for me to do), because I have to clean the house, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">I have to do all these other things. Then the stuff that\u2019s for me gets like, put to the side, because if I don\u2019t do all this other stuff and keep it in order, then like, everything will fall apart in terms of my relationships with other people. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">Then I feel like... because a lot of times, if I do kind of like, not keep up with people, I get messages like, \u201cWhere have you been? I miss you. We need to hang out.\u201d Like (sighs), just... I feel like if I do try to let go or not keep up with all this stuff then, it\u2019s like, I get all, my to-do list <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">grows, because it\u2019s like, everyone\u2019s sending messages and saying all this stuff. So I feel like I just have to keep up with it and keep everything in order or like, it\u2019s just... There is going to be too much to clean up, there is going to be like a mess that I have to clean up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, how do you feel... I want to make sure that... Well, I have a bunch of different thoughts in different areas, but then what, you know, how do you feel about coming more often? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: I would like to come more often, but my schedule is a lot! (ph) Peter (sp) is losing out\/moving out (ph), actually right (chuckles) now. It\u2019s a little bit crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right. Which is itself... (client chuckles), finding the time to take for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, because... Yeah, because... if I start that new job in January, then that\u2019s working like, three evenings a week, but it\u2019s not... I don\u2019t... but it\u2019s at Walter Reed (ph), so it\u2019s like further. Then I have a similar, a little bit of a similar schedule to this semester next semester, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">not quite as bad. So it\u2019s like, I feel like, I already feel like, \u201cOkay, I have, like...\u201d I already feel like I have no (chuckles) time! And so... it\u2019s (sighs) it\u2019s this issue, because coming here more often (and doing things like going to the gym, and doing these different things for myself) will be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">so good, but I put everything else in front of me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">I mean, you know, school is important and the job is important, but I am trying to like, say no to people more, so that the time that I have in between school and work can be spent on me. I\u2019m getting a little bit better at doing that, but then (chuckles) I\u2019m feeling like, I have a ton of school work, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">and then the time that I\u2019m spending not doing that, I\u2019m spending apologizing to people for not seeing them, or for missing events because I\u2019m so busy with like, work and school. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">It\u2019s (sighs) it\u2019s hard because I feel... so (sighs) like, saying no to people is so stressful for me and so hard on me that (sighs) it\u2019s like, almost, I almost feel like it\u2019s like a side job. Like today, I took 30 minutes out of my day to send people birthday cards, and someone flowers for their birthday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">and then respond to all these different messages I had from friends, because... I almost feel like it\u2019s like, like another job that I have. It\u2019s like, when I don\u2019t see people, I have to carve out a half hour, (chuckles) like twice a week, to respond to all these people and all this stuff. Because if <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">I don\u2019t\u2019 respond, then what if something happens and I need them and I have lost all of my friends, because I was too busy? Like (sighs), so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: I mean, it\u2019s sort of, ironically, this is what you\u2019re wanting help with, so you don\u2019t have to do that anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah! That\u2019s the whole, that\u2019s the whole thing, is like... I know that it\u2019s something that I need to do and make time for. And I want to, and it\u2019s... I want to find a way to make more time for myself, in general, overall. But in the transition, I guess, it\u2019s... I\u2019m realizing that it\u2019s like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">so (chuckles) stressful for me, because... and I know it\u2019s just like, a transition, you know? But it\u2019s, I wish that, (chuckles) sometimes I just wish that people would like... leave me alone, but I know that it\u2019s not them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">It\u2019s the way that I\u2019m like, perceiving (chuckles) everything, because if I didn\u2019t send people cards or flowers, I\u2019m sure that it would be fine. (chuckles) But I feel this like, sense of obligation I\u2019ve created for myself. If I don\u2019t do it, then it\u2019s like, I\u2019ve failed, because I created this expectation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">for myself. I don\u2019t think anyone else has the expectation of me. I created it, and I\u2019m punishing myself for not meeting my own expectation. The other people are just like... there. (chuckles) But I am creating what I think that they\u2019re doing or saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: (pause) I really think this is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, I think I can find time for it like, I already, I know pretty much, just need to be told the three days that I\u2019m going to be working, once like, some background check stuff and whatnot goes through. So... But I already know my schedule for next semester, too, so I kind of know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">like schedule-wise, where I\u2019m headed, so... Yeah. (pause) It would probably be good. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like I\u2019m putting you in a position of saying yes or no to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh (chuckles)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: I was wondering...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: Well, I just feel like that with everything, though. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not taking it personally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) No, but I mean, that\u2019s literally how I am with everything, it\u2019s... Um... But... because another way that I would like to, I would like to... I told you, you know, working out makes me feel so good mentally, and it\u2019s something I really need to also do as a \u201ctime for myself\u201d thing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">I\u2019m finding myself like, put , you know, it just, anything that\u2019s like really good for me or you know, just for me, I\u2019m just always putting off and prioritizing other things in front of it. So I mean, especially as I, you know, have my new schedule, and know when I\u2019m going to have free time, I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200792\">to be able to make a point to prioritize things like that. Like, coming here and just making sure that I carve out that time for myself because I\u2019m just, otherwise I\u2019m just not going to get it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well, I certainly want you to understand, even though you may not feel this way (client affirms), that you can absolutely say no. The only, the extent to which I\u2019ll be disappointed is simply that I want to make sure that you have the best treatment that you can get. (client affirms) This is your treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I think that trying to like, work with the schedule and carve out will... will be really (sighs)... I think it will be really good for me, because like I said, I\u2019m always putting everything in front of me. So it would be good if, at least twice a week, I could make time for myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">and not put everything in front of that, because that\u2019s pretty much like, how I... That\u2019s like my survival mechanism, is that I\u2019m putting everything else in front of me, because I need to keep all of that order and everything like, together. But it\u2019s like... it\u2019s almost like (sighs), kind of like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">fa\u00e7ade, like everything is not together, but I need to make it seem like everything is together. That\u2019s like my survival. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Well, just like when you limp is to compensate or something. In that sense, it\u2019s a limp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah that is, I mean... That is what it is, and it\u2019s just trying to... I think the reason like, that I need to like, have all these things to do and keep it all together is because I\u2019m so worried about what other people think of me that I want them to think that I have it all together. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">I want them to think that my like, house is in order and that I am in order. If they don\u2019t think that, I\u2019m so worried about what they\u2019ll think that I just can\u2019t, (sighs) that I just keep doing all (chuckles) this stuff so that never happens. But... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a solution that prevents solution. (client affirms) (inaudible), just window dressing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s just like, like a window dressing. Just and... I\u2019ve done that with like, material stuff a lot like, always needing to like, have this or have that because I need people to look at me or look at my house and think a certain thing. So like, it\u2019s just all these different <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">things are just a way of like, like a distraction, like a way of making people not know that I\u2019m, inside I\u2019m feeling terrible about myself, or inside I\u2019m judging myself against them, or I don\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough, or I don\u2019t think I\u2019m as good as them. But if I have the same handbag as them, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200852\">I am as good as them. So it\u2019s like, I\u2019ve always done all these different things to try to like, cover up people from seeing that I\u2019m... or I think that (chuckles) I\u2019m like, flawed. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: There is so much hurt inside that needs to come out. (client affirms) And what you do is desperately try to cover it up. (client affirms) And it takes so much work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, because it\u2019s, and it\u2019s to the point now where I\u2019m just like, I... Like, I just really do just want to let it go, because... it\u2019s... When you\u2019re, you know, studying organic chemistry and on top of (chuckles) all of this other stuff that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s just too much. I think... <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200891\">I always thought that by (sniffles) leaving my job, I would, everything would go away and be better. But, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m just finding new ways to stress myself out, basically. It\u2019s kind of like I, you know, mentally enjoy what I\u2019m doing (chuckles) more now; that\u2019s not the issue. But I\u2019m still finding <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200892\">ways to physically and mentally just completely wear myself out. (therapist responds) That has not gone away (chuckles) at all. It just, I\u2019m just doing it in new ways now.  (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">(pause) So I think that was like, the hardest thing to realize is that I made this change, but everything\u2019s not, it didn\u2019t fix (chuckles) everything. I think it was a good change, in terms of mental stimulation and interest, but it didn\u2019t fix (chuckles) everything else. So, now it\u2019s like, I\u2019m just finding <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">new ways to drive myself crazy, and feel anxiety, and have stress manifest itself, and put other things in front of me. Like I\u2019m just finding new ways to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">(pause) So, yeah, it\u2019s... I was just realizing that, because I\u2019ve had all these like, really horrible like, physical stress symptoms and stuff. I was like, \u201cI thought that when (chuckles) I left my previous job, those would go away,\u201d but I just found new ways to put pressure and expectations (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">responds) on myself. I like, can\u2019t go on doing that anymore. I\u2019m so (sniffles)... I just feel so like, worn and so tired from it, but... So I think feeling that worn is like... helpful and like, realizing that I need to like, give up (chuckles) these behaviors, but, um... I\u2019m realizing that I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D2\">go on doing this to myself (sniffles), because it feels like it\u2019s like... It just feels, it\u2019s just really tiring. Like, I don\u2019t have (chuckles) energy to do anything else for myself, because I\u2019m juggling so much. (sniffles, takes tissues) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">(pause) But, and I wish I could like... I wish I could change... I wish I could actually not really have expectations for myself. Like (sniffles)... almost like start with like, a blank slate and almost... It\u2019s almost like what I was telling you about, how I used to not think I was fat, because I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">really know what that was. It wasn\u2019t until other people started saying all these different things that I decided that\u2019s what I was. (therapist responds) It\u2019s almost like (sighs), I wish I could like, just start from a clean state and not (sniffles)... not have all these preconceived notions and these <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F2\">expectations for myself. Like (sniffles), I wish I could just accept... my performance or accept my physical appearance; just be, like, just be. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">THERAPIST: And not feel so imprisoned by them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because they just take, it just takes over everything and you could (sighs) I mean, I really do feel like, imprisoned by it. (therapist responds) It\u2019s totally taking over everything that I do and all of my behavior. It\u2019s just I\u2019m constantly putting pressure on myself all the time <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200931\">in every area, in areas where you don\u2019t even need to put pressure on yourself, I\u2019m putting pressure on myself. I\u2019m trying to set new goals for myself, and trying to do new things, and I just want to like, just give it all up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">THERAPIST: (pause) Do you imagine feeling free? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. (therapist responds) Yeah. I think that if I... I think if I was just able to like, stop, I would just literally feel like a weight was lifted off my chest. I feel like I would feel free. And I like... and still, I feel like that\u2019s not... As usual, I feel (chuckles) like that\u2019s not something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200971\">I could possibly achieve (sniffles), but I sort of dream of that, because I think it would be so amazing. (takes tissue)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">THERAPIST: Because on the flip side, you fear chaos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m afraid of what will happen if I just... stop, but (sighs)... But if I didn\u2019t, if I didn\u2019t fear the chaos, or I didn\u2019t... If I wasn\u2019t worried about what was going to happen, or if I wasn\u2019t worried about the negative, or what other people... The main thing is what other people would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B1\">think of me. If I wasn\u2019t worried about that, then that would be so... I would be so afraid, because the main issue is that I feel like I\u2019m burdened by like, judgment from other people. But it\u2019s really, it\u2019s really me judging myself and deciding what I think other people are thinking or saying (which <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B2\">they may not be). (sniffles) So it\u2019s really me putting judgment on myself, but using the words of others to do that to myself. But, if I could, if that all went away, that\u2019s what would be so freeing like, it would just be (chuckles) great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">(pause) And I think it\u2019s... The main thing is recognizing that it\u2019s not... I think I\u2019m holding everything that people said when I was younger (and really did say), and assuming that everyone now would say the same things. (therapist responds) And (sighs) they probably won\u2019t, but I just make it all up <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D1\">in my head. That\u2019s what dictates my life, basically. (therapist responds) (sniffles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">(pause) So, I feel like... I feel like I understand more why I think everybody is like, out to get me or thinking negative things about me, but I don\u2019t know... (pause) (sighs) I don\u2019t know how to like, stop feeling attacked by other people without totally isolating myself. Like, I think I feel like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F1\">if I start (sighs)... making more time for myself (saying no to people and all that stuff), all the friends, that everyone will leave. Then I\u2019ll be alone, and then... and I\u2019ll have my family (because they\u2019re family), and I\u2019ll have my boyfriend (because I know he really loves me), but what if anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F2\">happened to any of those people? Then I don\u2019t have any friends, because I\u2019ve alienated them, lost all of them. (therapist responds) (pause) I rationally know that won\u2019t happen (chuckles), but I... I think that\u2019s what I think will happen if I just let go. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561076\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">THERAPIST: (pause) (inaudible) (client affirms) I can see that you feel that way, too. (client affirms) (inaudible) that I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">CLIENT: No, that, well, that\u2019s the thing is, the rational part of me knows that I\u2019m manifesting all of this, and that I\u2019m making up these extreme things, and that they won\u2019t happen. But the rational like, the emotional part of me, and the frightened part of me, and part of me that\u2019s thinking that everyone\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A31\">out to get me takes over. I can\u2019t, the rational part can\u2019t really win out, because... I think I\u2019ve just, I\u2019ve been feeling that way for so long that it\u2019s like... it\u2019s like second nature to feel that way. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">(pause) And I\u2019ve tried to like... I guess I\u2019ve tried to... see like... I\u2019ve tried to, um (sighs), I guess simplify, in a way, and tried to like, observe good things that were happening around me without me controlling something or buying something for someone or... Like, I\u2019ve tried to see that. There <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A51\">is good, without me having to do different (chuckles) things to achieve it. But most of what I\u2019ve been able to see has been like, I\u2019ll notice like, really cute kids on the street, or strangers, or it\u2019s a beautiful day, or different things like that, but it\u2019s always something always kind of removed (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A52\">responds) from me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">It\u2019s never something... so, I really struggle seeing good in a situation without feeling like, I made it happen somehow, because of something I did and because of my control. So I think a big step for me would be just seeing that things can be good without me having to do anything, but, and things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A71\">are close to me, or really relevant to me can be good without me having to do anything. (therapist responds) But right now, the only place I\u2019ve been able to see it has been in stuff that\u2019s more like... removed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s like, we\u2019re going to need to stop in another minute.
