It's been a really busy week already. (pause) Someone I know from the Internet only who lives in New Zealand has been touring the U.S. for the last three weeks. And she has been saying since May that she's going to come to Providence, and she'd like to meet up with me while she's here. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">she's been just impossible to pin down her schedule. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">So at first she told me she would be here the week of July 20th and then like three days before we were scheduled to meet, she was like no actually not going to be here until August. And then she was like no, going to be here July 25th and 26th. And then no, going to be here July 28th. And I was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">like, after like three or four of these, I just decided not to try to keep -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: A spot open on my schedule. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But anyway, yesterday I get this text message at four in the afternoon saying you know, arrived in Providence a couple of hours ago. Only here until tomorrow. Want to get dinner. I'm like eehh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">But as it turned out yesterday I had a lesson scheduled that I cancelled because I worked late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I was at work until 8:30 trying to solve a problem that was really angering. So I texted her back and said you know working late, I'm probably going to eat dinner at work. I can meet you for a drink after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: So, so that worked out. We met for a drink in my neighborhood. It was fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Actually she brought the person she's staying with while she's in Providence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: He's a good guy. It turns out he knows a friend of mine from Harvard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It goes as planned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: So this friend of mine from Harvard, Charles, who was friends with my evil ex-boyfriend and Ashley back in the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Which is how I know him.

And I stayed out way too late. And I'm tired and hung over. (very long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">I don't even remember what I did Monday after that. What did I do on Monday? That was only two days ago.

(pause) Well I just feel really tired and stressed and overwhelmed by everything that I need to get done in the next couple of weeks. (pause) Obviously I'm kind of clear, I'm about to sneeze any second now. Yeah, just trying to think of things I can stop doing. Give myself more <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">room. Because it's just been really clear that I'm not (chuckling) taking enough time to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: To rest. Yeah. I mean I think I talked about this with you a couple of weeks ago. Maybe it was just last week. I don't remember now. Just this feeling of there is no sweet spot between -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: You know doing so little that I feel you know, the low self-loathing for being a useless waste of space and then doing so much that I'm constantly exhausted and frazzled and, yeah. (long pause) So I don't know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559690\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">Right, Monday I worked late too. That's what happened. And then I left, I left work in time to get to the Monday night country dance I had wanted to go. And I drove half way there and then changed my mind and went home. Which I've been doing that a lot this summer. Driving part way to the country dance <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">and then going home. Because I keep being worried about running into Tom there. Because that's the dance he goes to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">He goes to all the local country dances. Every single one of them. There's there's not a single one where I have reasonable certainty that he won't be there. Which is really upsetting. I am also upset with myself for letting him keep me away. (very long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">(continued very long pause)  (continued very long pause)  (continued long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I'm also really angry that Jodie and I spoke to anything. (long pause) I might be being unfair, but. It's really telling to me that she heard the whole story in detail and she doesn't see a problem with continuing to date him. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">(continued long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I'm really, really annoyed with myself that I let fear of potentially running into him keep me away from an activity that I enjoy. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">(continued very long pause)  (continued very long pause)  (continued pause) (yawn from client)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Well I'm thinking about what you said and also about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Um-hum. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: I see it seems difficult for you to sort of talk really here in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: And the one reminds me of the other -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Where you sort of (pause) are like kind of keeping yourself so tightly scheduled. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: And kind of subtly control of what you're doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: And maybe there's something else as well like with Tom and the country dances where maybe you're afraid of what you'd run into.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I also was thinking something during that long pause and thinking whether it was very glad to bring it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: The I've been scheduling myself so tightly and leaving very little scheduling margin just so that I wouldn't have to stop and think about everything that happened in May. Which I mean, so Tom assaulted me and then I spent a week and half with my parents. And that was traumatizing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">And then the day I came back, my friend Linda disclosed to me that her partner Timothy, her partner who had been a good friend of mine -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: And it was just so much full of this awfulness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: And I think it wasn't so great either you know, what with you know, a bombing and all sort of with -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: You know, the city being on lock down and which I don't know, this sounds terrible, but I'm going to say it anyway, personally I found the lock down and the police presence far more traumatizing then the original attack. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: And that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: I have a great deal of fear of the police.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: You know my dad he's been you know, harassed and beaten by police officers for no reason before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: Oh, I didn't know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. And when I was in middle school, our you know, community policing officer who was assigned to the middle school because I went to a I went to a magnet school in a poor urban area. I was bused in from the wealthy white suburb where my parents were living. It was a magnet school where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200991\">there were there was lots of classes and races in the black community. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559690\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">But anyway so there was a community policing officer who repeatedly sexually harassed female students. There were rumors that he was actually sleeping with some of the female students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: This is at a middle school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yes. It was disgusting. I mean thankfully he didn't do much more then you know, occasionally grope me as he walked by, which it was so Anyway the point is like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Police officers make me panic. You know when I'm walking home from the subway station, I will walk you know, an extra half mile out of my way so I don't have to walk past the police station. That sort of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">So just like having that huge police presence out on the streets, because they were patrolling Cheshire -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Fairly heavily that day. So it was pretty, it was very scary there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I bet. Did the stuff with your father happen before you were born, or when -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: No, this was I was in college. So I wasn't there for it. But it was right after 9-11.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: He was driving to work. (chuckle) On the base because he was a fucking you know, officer in the military. But we, we lived the suburb pretty far from the base. He had like an hour and a half commute to get to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Which took him through Zion, which is a very small town in Missouri. It's a sundown town. It's a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: What does that mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: It had laws on the books for many years making it illegal for black people to live there. So the phrase sundown town comes from there were some towns that were so overtly balls out racist that they would put signs up saying you know, niggers better be out by sundown or else. You know so they <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD1\">were allowed to come and work in the big houses in the town -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: But they had to leave by sundown. So Zion was one of those towns. It's a very tiny it may be two square miles of area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: There are no people of color who live in Zion. There are no Jews who live in Zion. Zion is an entirely white protestant, there aren't even Catholics who live in Zion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: If you look at you know, the city demographics for race there are still to this day laws on the books in Zion that you cannot rent you house unless you have permission from City Council and they approve of your tenants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: And you cannot buy a house in Zion unless there are three homeowners in Zion who are willing to write you letters of recommendation to the City Council. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. So he was driving through Zion and he got pulled over by cops. And they you know, demanded to see proof he was in this country legally. And he refused to show them anything except his Military ID. Saying you know, I'm an officer in the military. You can have my Military ID, I will not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D11\">show you anything else.
