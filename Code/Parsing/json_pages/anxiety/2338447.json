AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">CLIENT: So how are you today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I am OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: How are you today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I am good. I did the what do you call it multicultural fair yesterday. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: What was that? Excuse me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Well, what it was is like a lot of different clubs here trying to raise money for the club. And they offered $100. So the club that does the best presentation or whatever and I don't know who won yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So my God, I never did so much talking in my life so fast. Hello, how are you? Ooh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So wait. And how do they measure winning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Well, what they did was they're multicultural. They created these little mock passports. And it was so cute. And what everybody had to do was they had to go around because each table represented different countries. And like I said, if you walked up and you were interested to know what was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">on, we would tell you, \"You have to go into the center and go to that table and pick up a passport. Pick the passport up. Now you have to go and visit three countries.\"  And then each country that you visit, you'll get a sticker from that country onto your passport. And there's only enough space for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">three countries. So whichever three you like the most, then you go to them and get your sticker. Now each table, they had like food and you know, from that country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So I mean, it was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And it was the different clubs and everything. And I mean we had a good turnout. We kept running out of stickers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And what was your club again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Speech club.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yea, that's one of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: The one that you are the secretary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Vice President. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Vice President.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: And I recruited like I don't know fifteen people yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And have they joined?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: No. I told them that they will get some information via e-mail. And if they want to come join or well, actually come visit and check us out, see if you like it. And if so, you can join at any time. And a lot of them said, \"I heard a lot. Yes, I want to.\"  And I'm like, I got some literature <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">for you. And I was working it. Yes. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: So it's been awhile since we met. How are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: I'm good. But I keep wondering something. I said... and this was just this morning because I think what made me think this yesterday or two days ago... I don't know. Something like this. Today is Tuesday. It was maybe from last week. And I keep saying... it's like I was just ironing my uniform <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">and then I said all of the stuff that I know I've been doing, why can't I remember any of it? And I know we had this conversation. But I don't know. I think it kind of bothered me a little bit because I feel like if I was to... if I were asked a question, I don't think I could answer it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: A question about what, Yvette (sp?)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I mean, about anything I've done. I mean, I question myself and I'll say, I know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Anything you've done?  I'm confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Maybe I'm not saying it right. Let me see. I'm thinking about the workshops I've just done, right? And I'm interested in fundraising. I've just taken a fundraising workshop. I don't remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338447\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You don't remember what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: (chuckling) What I remembered. I mean, it's like I can remember some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Stop for a second. Close your eyes. (pause) Tell me a bit about what you learned in the fundraising workshop, just the general ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: General ideas?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Well... (pause) Well, first I have to know why we're having a fundraiser. And then I guess we have to know what people we need on a team. (pause) We have to know how much money we need to raise and what we're going to do to raise it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: All right. So you have to set fundraising goals?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: And then... (pause) I'm trying to remember. (pause) Oh, so... and then after we do that, then we have to find sponsors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: How do you go about finding sponsors?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Well, we can solicit people. Phone calls... oh, I do remember. Oh God, this is embarrassing. (pause) Phone calls, flyers. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Stop for a second. You're trying to remember the exact words, are you? I don't need you to remember the exact words. I need you to remember just some of the ideas that were talked about in the workshop. The main points of what you learned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (pause) I think it was three types or ways of... I can't remember the last one. Phone calls...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Stop. Open your eyes. As you go through this process, tell me what is it you're trying to remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That's the problem. Give me a book. Give me a textbook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: A textbook?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yes, anything from one of your classes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: This is the book that we have...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: That has... that does not have numbers in it, please.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Oh. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Well, this is a book that we have to read right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So this book is called \"After the Bridge Was Crossed: A Journey of Thought\" by Darryl Cooke. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: So I'm going to look at a page. This page is called... is Chapter 2. It is called \"My Interpretation of Love.\" So let me read this page. Give me a second. (pause) So here's the chapter. I just kind of skimmed it. And from just kind of skimming it, it looks like he's trying to explore the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">idea of, what is love?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: What is love to him? What is love to other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: He's trying to kind of understand what the concept is and why it has so many different meanings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: Right. And what love used to mean to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I didn't get that far. That's all I got. All right, what did I just do there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: You summarized what you've just read. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What is the difference in what I just did... and I didn't summarize...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: And not word for word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: You keep putting it on yourself to remember exactly the words being used. And that's inefficient, all right? That's not the mark of intelligence and that's not the mark of anything, right? But if I say... if we're having a conversation... let's say we're over at the cafeteria and I say, \"Yvette <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200931\">(sp?), I heard you took that fundraising workshop.\" And you say, \"Yea. Well, what did you think about it? It was pretty cool. What are some of the things you got out of it? What...\" and we had a conversation about it. What kinds of things would say to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338447\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: I would say... (pause) This is a problem that I have. (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: You're just kind of giving me some basic ideas about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: I would say that I've learned, well, the basic principles of fundraising.  It entails the reason for the fundraiser. Who all is needed. How do we get the help that we need for solicitation? The general ways of raising the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Stuff. That's perfect. That's perfect. What's wrong with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Because it don't seem like enough information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Listen. If I asked my students... I think we talked about this. If I asked my students after a 16 week course what they learned in the entire 16 weeks, how long do you think it will take them to summarize it? This is wrapped up in your idea that sometimes you think you're not as smart as <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">you should be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: I know. I'm trying to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: And nobody's memory... very few people have photographic memories where they memorize things word for word.  That's not efficient and if... I would not listen to you... how long was the workshop? How many hours?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: It was three days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Why would I need you to tell me three days' worth of information ever unless I took the workshop myself? Instead, a summary well, it was cool because we learned, what's the purpose of fundraising and how you go about starting it and how to set fundraising goals. That's far more interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">than a word for word analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: So now... so maybe that's what my son means then. He'd say, \"Mom, you're doing too much.\" I'm trying to understand what does he mean? When I asked him to explain it to me, he doesn't have the time to explain it to me. So I'm trying to see what it is that he's saying that it's too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Why do you think you're stuck there because this seems to be a point we get stuck a lot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yea, I don't know. It's like when I used to do the Facebook with my family or whatever, my son would say, \"Mom, nobody is going to read that because it's too long.\"  And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Tell me what's too long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Usually when I get on Facebook, it's around the time for voting or something like that. So I'm trying to let people know, look this is the time to get for real because, to me, Facebook is like a bunch of garbage. So when I think it's something that they need to know, then I get on there and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">I'll type some stuff (inaudible at 00:10:31).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: What is it you're typing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: Oh, I'll tell them, \"OK Facebook, now is the time to get out and do something constructive. It's time to vote. It doesn't matter who you vote for. Just vote. This is the time to teach the children blah, blah, blah.\" I mean, and I don't know. And I just think I keep going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: So do you find it hard to find the main point?

When you wake up in the morning, you get ready, you get dressed for school and then you go off to school. And then while I'm at school, I'd be wondering <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD1\">about what's going on at home because I'm not there. So what am I missing? And then when I'm at home and I have homework to do or whatever, then I start doing homework. But then I'm wondering. Like, I'm going by this house.

Is the door open?\" I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">do you know what I mean?

But every now and then, I get that thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: What thought?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: Like (inaudible at 00:14:52).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: You look sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Yea, I could feel it but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Tell me what's happening for you right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: Well, I don't know.

Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: Well, I had to get dad's medicine done. My stepdaughter came in with the baby.

And then I knew that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">the project was here so I had to have that done. But I don't want to give 40% when I know I can give 100%. Do you know what I mean? And I don't know. I don't... (pause) I don't know what it is but when I call my sisters and I told them, I said, \"Look, I need some help.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: And I just did it.  And she was like, \"Well, OK. Just come on.\" (crying) And I said, \"OK.\" And I think I'm a little happy, too, because she stopped... well, both of them. No, let me see. How can I say it? Maybe one half... one sister, she actually stopped smoking. Well, they both stopped smoking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B1\">cigarettes. One, she said she stopped smoking cigarettes and weed. So I'm so happy for that. But the other one still with the weed, she thinks it's not a problem.

Friends are over early in the morning and they are smoking and I mean, and this is the morning. So it'll be like, OK sister, come on, but trying to juggle the two.  And I think I'm surprise because one of her friends did come over and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201271\">she was ready to smoke. She was just sitting, just quiet the whole time. Never said a word. So I'm talking to this friend and I'm wondering, who comes to someone's house and just sit there and says nothing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: Why are you surprised that your sisters helped you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: Well, it's the way that they did because usually it'll be juggling the two of us, me and the friend. You know what I mean? But this time it was all about me. And the friend was just sitting there to the point where she just got up and said, \"Well, I'll see you all later.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: But I think that's what touched you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: That they pitched in to help you and it was all about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: And well, the theme that we're back to, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: The trauma piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: Oh.

You know how when you're just taking notes, a lot of people would abbreviate to make it a lot simpler and take up less time? I tried that.

Let me ask you if you have... this is going to seem a little off topic. I'll tell you where I'm going in a second.

Any kind of rituals that you have to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: (pause) Well, if you mean like... if I was in my kitchen my bathroom I hate it... it may sound crazy but I hate it when the sink is wet. How like when the faucet is running and you leave water. If it's supposed to be shiny, I want it shiny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">THERAPIST: So what do you do? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: I go in and I dry the water off of there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: Do you have to do that every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: No. Not like... it's just on my mind.

And then that's when I start to like keep going over it. It would just take me forever. Do you know what I mean? And then I try to break myself from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">THERAPIST: And what happens when you walk away from it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">CLIENT: Then I feel like I had to hurry up and get back to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">THERAPIST: All right. And then tell me what happens inside your head as you're doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">CLIENT: (pause) I really don't want to do it.

But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">THERAPIST: So you beat yourself up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">THERAPIST: Yea, it's pretty interesting.

When it all boils down to counting at this very moment, am I going to remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: And if you don't remember, then what? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: Oh man, when it's time to take that test, I'm a mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">THERAPIST: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: It's like I draw a blank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">THERAPIST: And you draw a blank and then what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: (pause) If it's not time, then I'll just sit there for a minute and I'll regroup. And I'll actually really take my time. I'll try to like... because I think maybe my breathing, I just get... I don't know. And I would have to have that piece of gum just to not chew, but just to know there's like a security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: So what's happening inside your body, Yvette (sp?)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: (pause) I think for the most part, I just... I always tell myself... it's like a conditioning thing maybe. And I'll tell myself, just calm down. Take it easy and you can do it. But then it always seems like when... if I give myself positive feedback, then the opposite happens. But if I tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A31\">myself, \"You're not going to do good,\" then I'll get it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: You think that's true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: Sometimes I do. And I don't know why that is. I always ask myself, I said, that doesn't make sense. Why do you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: So your anxiety is based in this fear that something bad will happen if you don't get all the words down. If you're not at home, if you're not with the people you love, something bad will happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yes. I feel... yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: That's exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Yea, how do you deal with that every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's like my stepdaughter; they were on their way home. And I tell you, I cannot sleep until I get that phone call and they say, \"We made it. We are home.\" Or it's like if my son tell me, \"Mom, I'm going to store.\" Then that means that if you're going to the store that means you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B31\">coming right back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">And if he doesn't come right back, then I said, well, he's been gone for over an hour. I know he's 18 years old and I don't treat him like he's 3. But if you said you're going to the store, then that makes me think you're coming right back. Now I'm thinking, well, let me just call make sure you're OK. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B51\">And then I'll call and then you'll answer the phone. So now I'm thinking maybe something happened. Then I'm calling again and then you don't answer. Then later on because then I just tell myself. I said maybe he doesn't want me bugging him. He's 18 years old. Just back off a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: And all the while your anxiety is doing what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: It's going crazy, yea. And then when he finally calls me, now I'm upset because I'm thinking, you don't have any consideration. If you know... I mean, it'd be different if you didn't live with me. Then what you're doing is your business. But you live with me so if you're telling me you're going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B91\">and coming right back, that's what I'm expecting.  And I'll explain that to him and he said, \"OK mom.\" But then does it again. And I keep telling myself, oh, just... this is what he does. But still somewhere inside of me I cannot relax. I have to know that you are OK. Yea, and oh God.

Because in some ways, I think this can help shape the nature of our work together. So in... I was... you're familiar with certain disorders, right?  Certain anxiety disorders we've talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D31\">about like posttraumatic stress disorder. Are you familiar with one called obsessive-compulsive disorder?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: You're smiling.

I had somebody tell me that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Tell you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: It was my son's girlfriend and she said that we should go in the kitchen. My son... well, my son was talking about it. He said, \"Mom, why does all of the cans have to be facing...\" The face is toward where you can see exactly what it is when you go. And I said, \"I don't do that. But now that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E11\">you say that and I'm thinking...\" (phone ringing) Ooh, I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">THERAPIST: That's OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: I thought I had it off.

And I told him, I said, \"I don't do that.\" So one day I go in the kitchen and I just started laughing because it seemed like the majority of the cans and stuff was facing me. And I said, \"Do I really do this?\" Then I have all of my canned tomatoes over here or the soups <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E91\">over here or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Why do you think you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT: Easier to find stuff when you want something and you got to get it real quick, you know where it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: And what... any other reason?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: I don't think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Does it make you feel comfortable when things are predictable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">CLIENT: No. Actually I like it when it's unpredictable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Do you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">CLIENT: I think so.

I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20207\">THERAPIST: Yea, that's not obsessive-compulsive. We all have...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">CLIENT: You were scaring me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020B\">THERAPIST: No, no. I was asking you some questions to kind of evaluate for that.

I can admit that. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">THERAPIST: Yea, and there were some very scary things that happened to your family. I mean, your parents are together and then they broke up. And then there was drug addiction on both sides and people were coming and going. And your grandparents helped raise you and they got sick. And then you left <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202171\">the house. You had all these kinds of comings and goings. And I can understand. You want your life to make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20219\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021B\">THERAPIST: To be predictable, orderly in some ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021F\">THERAPIST: There's safety in that routine. Yea, there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, does that fit for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20221\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20223\">THERAPIST: So I think that's important. But when this anxiety, I don't think it's due to memory problems. I think your expectation, though, your fear is if you don't know every word on the page, you're going to fail a test or there's going to be an extreme negative consequence for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20225\">CLIENT: Oh yea, that's so scary to me. Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20227\">THERAPIST: But the thing that's happening is you have a 3.7 GPA, right? The business plan you showed me, how long was it? Was it like eight pages?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20229\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B\">THERAPIST: So it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022D\">CLIENT: Somewhere around there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Yea, but it wasn't 500.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20231\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20233\">THERAPIST: So that means you do have the ability to screen out information and put it together in a way that it makes sense, right? As opposed to writing 500 pages of a business plan...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20235\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20237\">THERAPIST: ...you wrote an eight page, very concise, well written business plan, right? So you do have the ability to screen out some information that's not important and put it together in ways that are important. You understand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20239\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023B\">THERAPIST: And you have a 3.7 GPA which means you are having to do that all the time. And we know this because when you take a multiple choice test, you do finish the test. You may... it doesn't sound like you're agonizing over every answer to the point where you don't finish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023D\">CLIENT: No, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023F\">THERAPIST: All right. But you still have the fear that if you don't read every word or if you're not every place, something bad will happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20241\">CLIENT: Yea, and that's self-doubt. Oh, I will go back and I would question. And that's when I have to like just tell the teacher. Just please take it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20243\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20245\">CLIENT: Because I'll start changing stuff even though I know that this is the answer. But then somewhere deep in my brain something will say, \"No, that is not it. Go back and...\"  And now I'm starting to mix stuff up. And oh my God, when I start to do that, I be on... I don't even know how to explain <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202451\">it. I just... I could remember the last test I took in my Business Ethics course. It was my final. And I noticed all the scratch outs I started to put on there. And I looked at him and I had to tell him, I said, \"Oh God, just take it.\" And I had to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20247\">THERAPIST: But you still did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20246-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20246-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338447\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20249\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024B\">THERAPIST: So you're very uncomfortable with this anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024F\">THERAPIST: But it doesn't actually prevent you from doing well.

Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2026B\">THERAPIST: ...pretty easily and not other situations? To the point where I mean, this is... in some ways, it's a trauma related response and it costs you emotional. But it doesn't cripple you to the point where you can't be successful. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2026D\">CLIENT: I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2026F\">THERAPIST: I just wonder what's getting triggered for you. So when you're reading, what's triggered for you?  I know like for example remember when in our first session you told me about the guy. He has some racism issues...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20271\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20273\">THERAPIST: ...when you took the standardized test. Well, that was so painful for you. You kind of went down for the count.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20275\">CLIENT: Oh yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20277\">THERAPIST: So I think some of that gets triggered for you. But it doesn't get triggered all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20279\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027B\">THERAPIST: Why does reading trigger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027D\">CLIENT: Because I can remember since being a kid, that when I would read something, it's like... and I do that right now to this day. I try to still figure out, am I auditory, visual or both? Now I try to figure it out and I still don't know. But I can remember sometimes if the teacher is lecturing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2027D1\">and I'm listening and I can get it. But sometimes I can't get it listening. But if I read it, I can get it sometimes and then sometimes I can't get it.  It's almost like I guess if I really just think about it, maybe it's all dependent upon how I'm feeling that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027F\">THERAPIST: Maybe or the topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20281\">CLIENT: Maybe. Maybe. I guess if it's interesting, then I could read it and I'll get it. Or if you're telling it to me, I can get it. But if it's... and I guess that's normal, I guess, with anybody. If it's something that's not interesting, then you'll lose them maybe. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20283\">THERAPIST: Yea. I mean, I think there's that coupled with this idea of trying to control your environment so bad things don't happen like they happened to you in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20285\">CLIENT: Maybe, yea. I could see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20287\">THERAPIST: You're not just agreeing with me, are you? (chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20289\">CLIENT: No. No, honestly I could see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028B\">THERAPIST: But I think that's what... it sounds like that's what may... this may be about. A way of coping with the fact that life has been unpredictably difficult. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028F\">THERAPIST: So if you have order, if you can repeat things word for word, if you can get it all, then that's a way of controlling the environment. But that's not actually true.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2028E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338447\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20291\">CLIENT: Well, it's like I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20293\">THERAPIST: I know you know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20295\">CLIENT: (chuckling) I mean, but you know... (pause) Oh man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20297\">THERAPIST: You're smiling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20299\">CLIENT: Yea, because I feel like I'm getting somewhere now because I really want to get rid of this. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029B\">THERAPIST: How do you think you should get rid of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029D\">CLIENT: I don't know. Which... what... which... what... (chuckling) Because I wanted to try anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029F\">THERAPIST: Well, but in some ways you have if not gotten rid of it functioned through it.  There... it doesn't affect you equally all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A1\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A3\">THERAPIST: And it doesn't affect you academically. It really doesn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A5\">CLIENT: But it's like academically if I'm doing it right now and I can get it right now. But like math, if I'm doing the math and I'm coming to class every day and it's repetitious. I got it. Let six months go past. I'll use that as an example. And if you put it in my face right now, six months later, I can't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A7\">THERAPIST: But that's just about everybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A9\">CLIENT: Six months though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AB\">THERAPIST: Yes. Unless it's your area of expertise, that's everybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AD\">CLIENT: Because I was thinking six months. I'm like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AF\">THERAPIST: Yea, but again, I think it not only goes back to it now... I'm glad we're talking about this today because it helps me see as well.  It's not only an unreasonable expectation for what you think your brain can do. Your brain is an efficient machine. It dumps what you don't need, right? It <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202AF1\">goes into long term memory and it gets tucked in the corner and unless you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B1\">CLIENT: Like the recycle bin, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B3\">THERAPIST: Yea, and unless you access the networks that you need that information, right, you're not going to get it. Well, when you learn it again six months later, it might not take you as long. But you're not going to remember it word for word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B5\">CLIENT: And that is so true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B9\">CLIENT: Do you know I took a remedial math class once. And the teacher... because I thought I needed it and they told me, they said, \"Well, go and see a math advisor,\" when I took the entrance exam. And I said, \"Why do I do that?\" They said, \"Well, because you scored higher than normal for math.\" But <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202B91\">I felt like they made a mistake, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BB\">THERAPIST: Because they made a mistake with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BD\">CLIENT: Yea, so I went and oh God. I took this remedial math class and I had some students tell me... well, actually I overheard them talking. And they were saying, \"I don't know why she took this class if she knew she was going to get all A's trying to show everybody up, right?\" So the teacher would <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202BD1\">make everybody go to the board. And when it was my turn to go to the board, I did the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BF\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C1\">CLIENT: And every time I would go, the teacher then she made a comment and said, \"Why are you in this class?\" But I felt like I needed to be in that class because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C3\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C5\">CLIENT: ...I did a problem before and I was told that it would've been correct had I not missed this step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C7\">THERAPIST: So you just thought you needed remedial math class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C9\">CLIENT: So I felt like if... what if I continue to miss this step and I get everything wrong?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CB\">THERAPIST: But I think that's... I'm beginning to see why you don't trust your brain. I mean, your brain is doing what it's supposed to do, right? It dumps the information that you don't need. And if you need it, you have to go back and get it in your brain, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N202CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338447\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CD\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CF\">THERAPIST: Or you relearn it and the learning is quicker a second time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D1\">CLIENT: Yes, quicker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D3\">THERAPIST: I mean, I'm no expert in cognition but that's kind of my general understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D5\">CLIENT: Yea, but you're right though. It's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D7\">THERAPIST: You keep expecting to encode the information...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D9\">CLIENT: And keep it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DB\">THERAPIST: ...in a word for word format. It doesn't happen that way. So if you asked me right now to talk to you about a topic in abnormal psychology at the undergraduate level, I could do that. Do you know why I can do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DD\">CLIENT: Because you're doing it every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DF\">THERAPIST: Because I do it every day. Because I teach that class. I think I've taught that class 20 times. If you ask me a basic concept in statistics, I probably could not do that or explain it to you. Do you know why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E1\">CLIENT: You don't do it every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E3\">THERAPIST: I haven't done it in 12 years. Not on any serious level, right? So I would have to go back and someway relearn it, right, because it's tucked way in the corners of my brain. Unless my brain has dumped it because I don't do that all the time, right?  So the things that are practiced that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202E31\">do every day... your nursing background is right here at the forefront of your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E5\">CLIENT: And I feel like it's so far back here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E7\">THERAPIST: But the parts that you use but because you... because of this anxious response that you have given some of the past trauma issues, feeling the need to be prepared. But for you, prepared means learning something word for word and that's not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E9\">So when we go back to this idea about trusting your brain, you have a 3.7 GPA. You do really well in school. If you could actually trust and rely upon your brain without excessively questioning yourself and some of that's kind of recognizing what you know and how you learn and realize that learning <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202E91\">is not a word for word process I think you'd enjoy it more. I mean, what do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EB\">CLIENT: I think so, too. Because I even like... I even said I don't feel like reading so I'm going to skim. And oh God, I just can't do it. Then in my brain, it'll say, \"Just take the book. What you do is don't let anything interrupt you and just read. Just read.\"  And I've tried to do that. And again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202EB1\">like I told you before I get to that word I don't know, I grab the dictionary. Now that stops my process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202ED\">THERAPIST: So what if I gave you a homework assignment where you read a whole chapter of something and you don't look up any words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EF\">CLIENT: (pause) I can't promise you I can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F1\">THERAPIST: Just with one chapter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F3\">CLIENT: (pause) Ooh, God. I'm telling you that'll be so hard. If I run across something that I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F5\">THERAPIST: And it would be hard because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F7\">CLIENT: Because if I feel like then I don't understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F9\">THERAPIST: But you won't know if you can understand. There's nothing wrong with the dictionary. The problem is you're stopping your thought process by going to get the dictionary, looking it up. Then you get lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202FB\">CLIENT: Yes, and I have to start all over again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202FD\">THERAPIST: And you are not allowing yourself to understand the meaning of the word with the context clues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202FF\">CLIENT: Exactly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20301\">THERAPIST: Right. So you're actually doing yourself a disservice. You're not helping yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20300-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20300-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338447\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20303\">CLIENT: And I figured that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20305\">THERAPIST: Yea, my mom was a reading specialist. She'll tell you... and she's the one who used to harass me as a child, \"Go get the dictionary,\" right? Because I'd be like, \"What's this word mean?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20307\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20309\">THERAPIST: She's my dictionary. But you're actually stopping yourself. And for you, stopping yourself involves this whole anxious process where you question yourself and you question how smart you are. That's not helping you. So your homework and I want you to work at it is to read a chapter of <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203091\">something and don't look up any words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030B\">CLIENT: Don't look up any words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030D\">THERAPIST: No, just read it. When you're tested on something, you're tested on some details and mostly the main idea. So just read a chapter of something and don't look up any words. How will that be to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030F\">CLIENT: That's going to be hard. I kid you not. That's going to be very hard.  Because I have two dictionaries on the table. And if one is over here I don't worry about it because I can grab this one. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20311\">THERAPIST: What's the last word you looked up, by the way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20313\">CLIENT: The last word I looked up was didactic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20315\">THERAPIST: Didactic. And do you remember what you were reading about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20317\">CLIENT: Well, I had a thesaurus. It was for speech actually. It was our word for the day. And I can remember that it has something to do with the way we study, the way we teach somebody. It's something that means educative, informative, something of that nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20319\">THERAPIST: So then you looked up the specific definition and did it help you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2031B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2031D\">THERAPIST: In what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2031F\">CLIENT: It helped me... well, I mean, I was able to get it and I could make sentences with it. And I like to play around with words. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20321\">THERAPIST: But you were about to get it... you were going to get the main idea of whether... because you kind of knew what it meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20323\">CLIENT: Well, from the definition?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20325\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that what you just gave me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20327\">CLIENT: Yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20329\">THERAPIST: Try to not look up any words. This'll get you to hopefully as we work more trust your mind, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2032B\">CLIENT: And that's... I mean, because I want to be able to just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2032D\">THERAPIST: Yea. And it's not that I don't... I'm saying never use a dictionary. I'm saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2032F\">CLIENT: I know what you're saying so that I don't get lost and have to... and it's so time consuming. And like you said, learn from the context clues and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20331\">THERAPIST: I got an idea. This might help you get through it. Don't look the word up but you write down any word that you don't know and then go back to reading. So you have a piece of paper next to you. So I want you to read the chapter but to kind of quell your anxiety, why don't you write down the <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203311\">word and the page it's on. And then after your reading, go back and look up the word if you must, only if you must.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20333\">CLIENT: Only if I must.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20335\">THERAPIST: Only if you must. All right. But I hope you don't.  So this way you can feel like you still get to use your dictionary. But I want you to try to practice reading without looking up words. Just write it down then go right back to reading. It's still a problem because you're still interrupting <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203351\">yourself. But it's still quicker than stopping to look up the word. So let me know how that goes this week.
