And all that I haven't either because it hasn't occurred to me or because I tried it once and it didn't work and I got frustrated and felt stupid and couldn't bring myself to like pushing until I got it to work. I clearly can't say that to my boss, but it just makes me look incompetent and\/or lazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: And it's really upsetting and I don't know how to get past this because just like I dread going to work every day because by making no progress kind of sucks and is shitty and, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(Pause): [00:01:36 00:02:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: For the last two days at work I actually had my cell phone out on the table, on the desk between the edge of the desk and the keyboard where anyone could see it and was just reading Internet all day, on the cell phone so that no one could tell that I was wasn't doing anything all day. And that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">was clearly a bad choice and it was clearly wrong of me but, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(Pause): [00:02:35 00:03:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I almost wish I worked in one of those high tech, no high security facilities where you're not allowed to have personal devices because then you have no temptation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(Pause): [00:03:16 00:03:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Is there a practical way you can leave it in the glove box in your car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I could do that.

And then, I'm not saying it was well meant, but it makes you feel worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yep.

Everything feels as though I'm every bit as critical, disappointed in you, clear about your egregious failings as you are, or your boss is, for that matter.

It was really stressful and terrible. So, it (unclear) the Girl Scout Camp in Michigan, and the scout camp gives us a rec center to use and like people just (unclear). <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">There were like 50 of us and some people who are anti-camping because they are indulging in nominative performances of femininity and, 'ooh, camping is gross,' and, 'what about my nails?' and all that bullshit tend to get a hotel just outside of the boundaries of the campground only two and a half <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">hours a day and just drive in every morning for the workshops only and drive back out. I had attended the camp and even brought a tent in case there was like a field or something where we could do tent camping. But I got there and it was just, it was so alienating, like everyone knew everyone except <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200373\">me. I was the stranger and they were like when I got in Friday after work, the room had divided itself up into like women who were wearing Victoria's Secret pajamas and talking about makeup and skin care products and movies and like men who were shouting, very loudly discussing and very argumentative, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200374\">in a basically male way, like video games and technology and a couple of them were saying things that were completely wrong and incorrect about technology, but like there were a few women hanging around that group and every time they tried to interrupt, or even, not interrupt but join the conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200375\">in any way, they got (unclear) shouted down and shut down and it was just this horrible, horrible, icky gender dynamic. I'm like, in a group that big, obviously, there were some people outside the two main groups, so I tried introducing myself and the first person I introduced myself to I went up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200376\">said you know, 'hi, I'm (unclear), and (unclear), my home chapter is Chi Omega, and he just looks at me and says, 'I'm in the Navy and I'm a Republican and I'm in (unclear) in this very challenging kind of way. I guess because Chi Omega has a reputation for being pretty far left in terms of politics <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200377\">of the student members but like, yeah, it was just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: So the national fraternity, and these are people from various chapters at various schools -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: We're all alumni.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Each branch was from like 23 to there was some guy in his '70s there. Yeah. There were people this was for Region 1, which is the northeast THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Maybe parts of Ohio. Yeah, Ohio but not west Ohio, was the only region there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I guess that's part of the country. Okay. I was just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: So, yeah, there were people from pretty far off, but not that far off. It was the northeast, basically. But yeah, it was terrible and all night (unclear) the mean group on the campsite. I couldn't deal with it so I fled to the hotel and got a room. And that was pretty miserable, too, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">it wasn't actually a hotel. It was this horrible, shabby, rundown motel and the room smelled like mildew and the bathroom was filthy and there were like these awful, cheesy, like Americana-type placards and like bad kitschy art all over both the rooms and the office and there was like a 5' tall plushy <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">Uncle Sam and like you know, 'Give your problems to God, he'll be up all night anyway.' And like cheesy crap like that that like I really don't expect to see in this part of the country, like that's very strongly associated for me with the deep south. But anyway, it was very unpleasant. And there was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D3\">no WiFi. No. But I had a tiny bit of service on my phone so I (unclear) both my country (unclear) on the phone saying, 'this is horrible, I want to come home.' I feel so alienated and miserable,' and then phone service cut off which given that I was already feeling like isolated and alienated, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D4\">I'm sure you can imagine how I felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559696\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was terrible. And Saturday was a little bit better because I got there late. I woke up late and so I got there just in time for the workshops to start. I missed breakfast and the socializing bit of it. And once the workshops got going, like it was much easier to track with people because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">we were talking about the things we had in common. We were talking about fraternity, about the challenges of being on staff. I had a lot to learn about being a new staff member. They had a lot to teach me and there was also like we're all in this because we care about the fraternity and we care about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">the students. Those are pretty big, important things to have in common. So it felt better, but it just started off on completely the (unclear) foot. Yeah, my boss, I guess, like this is a job a volunteer job but the person who will be supervising me in my work for (unclear) is really just like her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200513\">She's grumpy and arrogant and just really thoughtless and tactless and like casually cruel to people. And she has a clique. She has a cultist personality people who absolutely adore her. But, my sense of things from just like listening closely to what other people said is that she's a difficult person <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200514\">to work with and a difficult person to get along with and has caused problems for the region before. So, I don't know what I 'm going to do having to work closely with her over the next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">(Pause): [00:20:46 00:23:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I don't know, for some reason what's sort of striking me about like your description of the early part of the weekend and its horrors, is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I feel it's a little melodramatic to call them horrors they'd be more like unpleasantries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Okay.

There was also one shower for 50 people like that was a little upsetting. And I was on my menstrual cycle and like I use reusable products I don't (unclear) disposables.

The situation at work is entirely my own doing for me about my job.

But for the most part like within my team, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">hasn't been pinging for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No, I let's see. So what I am oriented to is the moment or today as we've been talking, are the ways that have you're experiencing some amalgam of me and being in this room and what you're talking about outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: That get in the way of you're being able to think and talk more freely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And in the first instance the air talking about work, it seems like I said, in here and in combination what you were talking about with work was so thick with your feeling so kind of exposed and kind of criticized and sort of passive and helpless, and was like no space.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559696\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: It's not so easy to think and talk under those conditions, really, I don't think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: And in the second instance, it seemed, there was more room but a kind of similar feeling of alienation and oppression and danger, wariness, something on that spectrum there. Yeah. So I'm not at all disagreeing that the situations are quite different and your roles in them are quite different. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">I guess I'm just trying to explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Okay. Right. (Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And the reason maybe I'm (unclear), the reason I'm more interested in that way is because I think something that causes you a lot of trouble like out there in your life is a kind of shutting down with difficulty continuing to be able to think and feel. Like if at work, it's more obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: But maybe in some kind of, certain situations it can be fairly evident too. And so I'm interested in looking at how that stuff comes up here as a way of making it easier to deal with out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Okay. Thank you for laying it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: There's a lot that hadn't been clear to me before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">(Pause): [00:37:30 00:37:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Maybe we should stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
