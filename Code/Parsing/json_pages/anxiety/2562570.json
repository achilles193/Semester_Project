I kind of couldn\u2019t tell. So they basically need whatever documentation. Like what I was doing, I guess, this whole time. So I might need a version of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">that letter without the cat part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Just saying that this is what I have been dealing with.

Yeah. I guess they want just some kind of In a way I am not sure I understand. Let me read it to you because I don\u2019t understand actually what Lloyd was saying. Because in a way I don\u2019t want to incriminate myself. Then aren\u2019t they going to say, \u201cWhat the hell. Why didn\u2019t you just finish <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">here? Why were you \u201c (laughs) I don\u2019t know what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So he said (pause), okay. So he said, \u201cDocumentation.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, let me know anything and I will put it together.

I am not sure I know all the reasons but anything you can come up with beyond your own personal statement. Doctors reports, passports, diplomas. Think of anything else you can come up with. The main issue, it has been explained to me, is that the university is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">going to want to be reimbursed for all the semesters you weren\u2019t registered.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">What does that mean? I don\u2019t know what that means?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Is there a registration fee? Do you pay every semester to be enrolled as a registered student?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I guess. Yeah. But then why would they Reimbursed for what though?

So in other words, in order to retroactively say -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: \u201cOkay, well let him finish his degree but you now have to pay your fees as though you have been -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: There the whole time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: a student, at least registered. It is probably some It is not like a course fee. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Maybe 50 dollars a semester.

I don\u2019t want to present anything that then is going to make it \u201c I don\u2019t know. I mean, honestly, I would think what is in your letter is enough. I mean (laughs) everything That is so clearly spelled out that it is clear that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">yeah, this person could not function in any kind of consistent way. So, I will see if maybe that is enough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">Because I feel like, well, if I just say I mean, if say I was at Brown they are going to be like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: \u201cWhy should we help you out. You left us to go to \u201c That doesn\u2019t make any sense. You know? I could, however He says also death certificates. I mean I could. I mean it is fucking morbid but I guess I could get my aunt and my grandfather\u2019s. Although I found out it is like 50 dollars to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">a death certificate. I mean it is like everything is money (ph). (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: You should talk to the registrar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: And see because they may be able to say, \u201cOh no.

Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So then you would know to just do that part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

They obviously want to. I mean I think they would have just said, \u201cWe can\u2019t do it.\u201d So obviously there is a way to do it. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Because he talked to the I called the department chair and all that stuff.

That is what happens when things are, you know. When you are in that kind of state of mind you just, it doesn\u2019t matter what is only left or what is Do you know what I mean?

(pause, tapping sounds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">And I wrote to Walter (ph) in London to ask how is it going there. I am just going to write to the registrar directly, actually. I don\u2019t know why I am asking him. I mean, because he asked so that is why I am asking him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">But he wrote to the registrar but then we didn\u2019t hear anything back. So I think I am just going to write directly. I am just going to be like, \u201cI am almost done.\u201d And I started writing so that has been good. I got a bunch of index cards. I came up with a new system. I just have a shitload of index cards, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB1\">on each index card is just like a memory or some kind of snapshot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">I was like, you know what? I am just going to start with that. Like compartmentalize. And then if each one of those cards is like three pages that is already like a hundred (laughs) page book right there. Do you know what I mean?

We were saying how this is the problem. These stories, not just my families but a lot of my kind of families, you just can\u2019t make this shit up. You know? And the problem is She is right about one thing, that it is a bit of a language issue. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">It is like, how do you write about this stuff in English? You know? Some of it doesn\u2019t translate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Particular kind of experiences?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: There is something about it that doesn\u2019t translate in English. It is hard to describe and it is hard to evoke what is in your mind. Because what is in your mind is so rooted in this cultural You know? So some of it sounds flat, even boring. Like the memory just comes out like, \u201cThat is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">interesting.\u201d Or something. Something just doesn\u2019t translate about it very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">Or it just sounds like one of these stupid, like all these novels that are, \u201cOh, my fucking family in Mumbai,\u201d or whatever. These kind of like very Anglicized, western, watered down, immigrant. They are all the same story over and over and over. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">It is like it has become like its own genre that is just palatable for white people to feel like they connect with the world. But really there is nothing really other than just kind of some schlocky entertainment value, there is really no literary -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">Like what is really the art? What is the point? There are a lot of books like that about kind of making you a little teary eyed about identity stuff and, you know. And she is right. Alp (sp) is right about that. She is very hard-nosed about that kind of thing. Now I can\u2019t do anything about that because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">I am not like her. I have to write it in English. So for me it is a little more I don\u2019t have that choice. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">So that is why it is what is what you said. That is why I was like, you know what? Then just chop it all up. It is already impossible to tell it in some kind of linear way. You might as well just chop it up. And I am going to try to write about it very straight. Like take myself out of it. Because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">think that is the other thing I don\u2019t like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">Because otherwise it is going to sound like some kind of angry You know, I just can\u2019t help it. It is just going to sound angry and sad. So it is almost going to be like some kind of reportage type writing. You know, just very like, \u201cThey did this. They did that.\u201d You know? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I mean, the way you talk about it to me it never actually sounds like the central essence is an immigrant\u2019s story. There is so much more as you are talking about it that has to do with memory and waking up that is very -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">It ties in your experience of family or your experience that ties in with Assyrian history. But that is its own thing, that broken up sense of self and how memory gets sort of pieced apart. And how do you put this all together in one place. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: But it is hard to separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Oh, I am not saying you would. It is impossible to separate. But it feels -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562570\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: But you are saying the main theme is kind of about Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t know. Quite honestly, I am not even sure what the main. I don\u2019t know. That is why I am thinking maybe this needs to be very different than what I thought. Maybe it almost does need to be like a, even if it is a novel, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">it has to be in some kind of like almost like a cultural history type way. Not some kind of like Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: So I was even thinking there could be letters in there. There could be newspaper clippings. I am not sure how that works exactly. I mean, obviously I think I would have to make all that up, I guess, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">But in other words, that it would be some kind of more like a document even if it is fake, even if it is fictionalized. Because I can\u2019t tell. I don\u2019t know what is the story to tell? It is such a clusterfuck. Which one do I tell? You know? So it is better that it just be some kind of piecemeal set of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F71\">documents or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Do you remember the title you thought of? I don\u2019t know if you are still sticking to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: \u201cIcing Glass?\u201d Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Not of your poetry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: Oh. \u201cThere is No Hiding Place Down Here?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: No. [I already read that one.] (ph) (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Wow. That is a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: It is a different one. I am not going to get all the words right but it was something about, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I have been.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Oh, the recent.

It is a very particular story. I mean, in a way, Brian, I guess one of the things I am trying to say is, you know how we talked about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D1\">how hard it is for you, even in here, to kind of get into the particulars of your experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">There are so many particulars that are your story that are not in anyone else\u2019s story that is unique. You know, you are so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: Well then you are saying that it does have to be about me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I mean, it always sounds like you are talking about you even if you are not talking, even if you don\u2019t write it autobiographically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: But that is the thing. That is what she is saying. She is like, you know, obviously, how could it not be about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: I mean you are the one writing. But just that to not make it It does become Once you get past a couple of pages that is some very self indulgent You know, to make it And also, how do you maintain that for 200 pages or whatever? I mean that is, you know. So in other words, yes, some memories <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201191\">I write about of course it has to be me. You know, so if that little piece is about playing with my grandmother, well I am there. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">But that is not every single little chapter or whatever is from my perspective, my memory.

But I am saying even fictionalized it can\u2019t just be 200 pages of this one That is really hard to pull off. Like I don\u2019t think that is I don\u2019t think I have that in me. I don\u2019t know what I would have to say for 200 pages about that particular <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201231\">theme. I need other things to buttress. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: Sure, sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: But, yeah, of course. I mean, there are going to be all kinds of parts that are then me. You know?

It is more like you are talking about the intergenerational transmission of trauma.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Exactly. And that I am the only one who doesn\u2019t know where I have been. These fuckers don\u2019t know where they have been. I am the one trying to wake up from it. They are just resigned to it. So that is what needs to be made clear. So they will be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: So that could start 200 years ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I am not going to, but yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in a way it will be very much about me. Those parts where I am in the memory that will be maybe the parts of the book where it is like, wow, so this is what This is the result of all this other stuff of that is in the book. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Something like that. I am not sure. But the important thing is just the fact of doing it. Like just the index cards, writing the memories on each card. That is pretty cool. You know?

Yeah. Yeah, I mean it is already paying off, going to Assyria, even though I haven\u2019t gone yet. Yeah, it is necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">(pause, tapping sounds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">Yeah, because I think I am finally in the place where I am not, you know. I look at my CV now and I am like, \u201cWhat?\u201d I mean, come on. Give me a break. I am finally owning up to how qualified I am and how much I have to offer.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: This is where it is a kind of I mean it is just terminology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: Got it. Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: Some people never meet the criteria for a full on depressive episode but can have a kind of chronic depressive (cross talking at 28:04).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: It is a like a low grade fever. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">THERAPIST: And it actually has to be for two years or longer. Whereas, a depressive episode is a more severe version and lasts two weeks or longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: Right. Right. Well in a way, that makes more sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: I have never understood the Actually, I don\u2019t understand That I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Mild depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah. Even my friends sometimes. We are like, \u201cThat just I mean, who doesn\u2019t get depressed for two weeks?\u201d I mean how is that clinical, in a way? But, yeah, that makes perfect sense. Yeah, that makes perfect sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: You know, I think you have had I don\u2019t think you have had a depressive episode, a full depressive episode, in a long time. I put that down because it helps your case to have that have been there in the history.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562570\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">THERAPIST: But you have had periods where it is, like if it is hard to get out of bed, you are sleeping a lot, you are not eating right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Like basic even self-care issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Right, right. No, I think when I met you that was depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: That was. Yeah, yeah. That was. But since then it has been more situational kind of and more like just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Or what is happening, I think, gradually is even where there have been things that rather than leading to a month long depression, and it led to two weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: And then it led to a week and then it went to three days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: So it has been slowly that the situational things that would have triggered a depression just don\u2019t anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: Just don\u2019t. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: You get what they mean. You are catching it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: I mean look at this. I mean this is a big deal what happened last week. That is a big deal. Like that could have easily put someone in a tailspin. (laughs) You know, but, yeah. I mean it is also healthy that I am not gloating about it. Do you know what I mean? I do feel bad. I do feel bad. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B91\">wish that it didn\u2019t have to be this way. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">My uncle is a good guy. I have never said that he is not, whatever, but they don\u2019t understand sometimes until you kind of use blunt language. They don\u2019t fucking get it. They don\u2019t get it. And I am kind of tired of feeling bad about that. So I feel bad about the situation but the situation didn\u2019t need <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB1\">to exist to begin with. It is not my fault. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">Whereas, in the past I would put it on me. I would get all sensitive about it and this and I just don\u2019t fucking care anymore. You know? It is an overall sad situation but (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Well it is another breaking through of barriers to being in reality, Brian. You were saying, \u201cI am not going to tolerate colluding with your delusions around this anymore.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: And here is a place where, you know we talk about like the bubbles that protect you from knowing parts of reality. Your entire family is in a bubble around your grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: And there is no one on your side supporting trying to break out of this bubble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: Right. Well, or one day they are, one day they are not. One day they are, one day they are not. Yeah. Which I knew. I mean that is the both sad and beautiful part of this plan. I knew that all I had to do was say that I was going to call and that they were going to freak out. And I also knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C91\">that my Mom was going to turn on me (laughs), like the next day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">You know, now she is all cool but I knew. I knew that they are just not I can\u2019t get them to be consistent. They are going to keep, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: That same day, you know, we have this exchange around the snowstorm and you are showing and not showing, which I know there is a way you could sort of think it was unrelated to the feelings you were having. But I also wonder if there wasn\u2019t something that got repeated here in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">Like if my message was confusing to you when I called. You know, if it was just sort of ambiguous something. Or that I have feelings about your not calling to cancel. You were so, so powerfully expressive of your frustrations with your mother before. Like wanting to call her up and have a conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D11\">and then she is upset about something. You know, was there something alive in that in here too around maybe things with money or time? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562570\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D3\">CLIENT: Maybe, yeah. I don\u2019t know. (tapping sounds) I don\u2019t know. I mean, yeah, I was like I mean, I wasn\u2019t thinking about but now if I really, really, nitpick at it, yeah, I mean, you know. Maybe on some level I was like, \u201cWell, so are we meeting or are we not?\u201d You know? I don\u2019t want to park in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D31\">the garage. Whatever. If we have to park in the garage then I am not coming in (laughs) or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Did it feel like I didn\u2019t want you to come in? Was there anything like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">CLIENT: No. Not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">CLIENT: No, no, no. Not at all. No, I mean it was very clear. You were just like, \u201cLook, it is bad out. If you come in you can\u2019t park on the street. You have go to, you know. Just let me know.\u201d I mean it was actually very clear. Which is why I didn\u2019t think I mean, honestly, I literally glossed over <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB1\">it. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, thinking about it after the fact, just so you know, I am not going to charge you for that day because I think I do understand that my message might have left you feeling ambiguous enough about it that it doesn\u2019t make sense to do that to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">CLIENT: That is okay. It is alright. I appreciate it. That is okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">THERAPIST: I still think there is something, there is a lot happening in the ambiguity of that day that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I think you could have been anybody calling me and I was going to shut down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">THERAPIST: And I get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just shut down. I was like, who am I going to call and say what right now? I am about to lose my fucking mind. Just beside myself. And that is a whole other. That has nothing to do with you or anybody. That is just a general. Like that I agree with you. I don\u2019t like that, when I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E71\">like that. What if I had a job interview, let\u2019s say, by phone? What am I going to do shut down and just bail on the job interview? Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">You can\u2019t. It happens but I know that that happens with me and I don\u2019t like that. It doesn\u2019t happen much anymore. Like for example, let\u2019s say if it just wasn\u2019t snowing. I think that would have even changed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED\">CLIENT: Because I would have come in and the day would have just, you know. It was just such a like, Jesus Christ, you can\u2019t get out of the house. The plow guy isn\u2019t here yet. Just it was intense. It was just too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Intense with some kind of feeling about being intruded upon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, like just smothered and once again, like instead of just having a nice snow day. \u201cYeah, I probably won\u2019t be able to come in because, yeah, I can\u2019t get out.\u201d Whatever. You know? I was like, yet again I opened my fucking eyes first thing and this is what, again. Like how many times does <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F11\">this keep happening. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">But in that way it was good. Because, see, it would be different if I shut down, I didn\u2019t come in here and then it just kind of little things like that kept happening since that day. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">CLIENT: I stayed shut down. I am all pissed. It was just one day. Even the next day I was out, I talked to my cousin, I was doing shit. You know? I think in that moment because it was the last straw. It was just a total So it wasn\u2019t like other times in a weird way. It was more like, okay. This one <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F71\">last time (laughs) I am going to hunker down and I am dealing with this fucking thing. This stops right now. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562570\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201FB\">CLIENT: And it just became a bit, what is the word? Like hyper-focused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201FD\">THERAPIST: All consumed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That had to get done and then that was it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20201\">THERAPIST: The specifics of what was the last straw that I think is really important because I remember listening that day. Your language was so much about once again this is coming to me. Like the intrusiveness of your family into your life, into your psyche, into your being, into your cells in a way <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202011\">that doesn\u2019t register as good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20203\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20205\">THERAPIST: So I could imagine if that is the state inside of you that is getting triggered a little bit even coming in to see me could have a level of just too much, people get away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20207\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20209\">THERAPIST: A phone call can feel like an intrusion. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2020B\">CLIENT: The phone call can, yeah. Coming in here though, no. I don\u2019t know why. Because I was just kind of looking forward. That is what I am saying. If there was no snow, it was like, great, at least I can go and I can just fucking vent to Claire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2020F\">CLIENT: And she is the one person who will understand what the fuck I am saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20211\">THERAPIST: So maybe not me then but maybe the snow is another kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20213\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Totally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20215\">THERAPIST: The snow plow. You can\u2019t get out. You are stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20217\">CLIENT: I mean, literally, I was claustrophobic. Yeah. Especially with all the snow we have been getting. It is like tomorrow again. So, yeah, it was just one thing after another. But, again, see the difference now is instead of saying, \u201cIt is happening to me.\u201d Or, \u201cWhy is the world against me?\u201d The <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202171\">world isn\u2019t against me. These people are nuts and they don\u2019t have the respect and thoughtfulness to be like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20219\">I mean, now they do. Right? After I lost it. My Mom, she is like, \u201cYou know, I told them. I said, \u2018You know, what, Brian is Where is everybody else\u2019s children? Brian has put up with this for years now. He sees. We are downstairs. he sees the situation day in and day out. It is very stressful for him.\u2019\u201c <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202191\">You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021B\">But again it is like, great, but (banging noise). I had to be kind of the bad guy. And now I have to be estranged from my uncle for a while. You know, use your brains, man. Use your brains. So that is a good feeling. To be like, no one is conspiring. The world isn\u2019t. I am surrounded by nut jobs and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2021B1\">I just need to extricate and then they can do whatever they want. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021D\">I don\u2019t have this problem. I didn\u2019t have this problem is London even when I was all by myself. So the problem is, though, then that triggers feelings about money. Do you know what I mean? It is Darien. You know? It feels so claustrophobic. I can\u2019t. I literally can\u2019t. I need to make \u2018x\u2019 amount of dollars <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2021D1\">to have a life in this city without roommates and without living with three people wherever the fuck, that some of my friends do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021F\">Well that is not going to happen anytime I don\u2019t see even a hint of that happening. And I don\u2019t want some rinky dink 40,000 dollar a year job. That is not really I am still going to kind of be scrambling. Do you know what I mean?
