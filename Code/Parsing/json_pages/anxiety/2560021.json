By the way, I want to talk about this phrase, \"It is what it is.\" I hate this phrase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">INTERVIEWER: Not a fan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">RESPONDENT: No. I think it's...I think it equates to I give up. Like I no longer will think about this or try to solve this or prove this or anything else. I will simply endure it. It is what it is. It cannot be changed and it cannot be otherwise defined or questioned. It is simply defined by itself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">It's passive...completely passive. Word is from Jacqueline; she says that I'm...oh man; this is not a great concept. It is what it is. Maybe it is for [inaudible 01:04]. We take on everything that Alec predicts. Maybe that's an important shield. Like yeah, let's let Alec do it. Maybe that's important <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">in helping. [inaudible 01:17] like me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">[01:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, what about for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">RESPONDENT: Is it giving up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">RESPONDENT: No. It's...[inaudible 01:31]. Have I talked about Charles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">INTERVIEWER: You've talked about Charles before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">RESPONDENT: So he [inaudible 01:36]. We were talking about stuff and we're really good friends. We got to the point where we felt like talking about aspects [inaudible 01:49] over the years. It's like I am infuriated by your lack of action in certain aspects of your life. He's like I get that. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I am so often shocked that you have the audacity; that you know better than everybody else. I'm like yeah sure I do that, it's like but very often I'm correct. He's like yes. Yes. Still. It's true though; I do that. And he's like yeah I'm sort of [inaudible 02:29] about being. He said yeah. Everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">is broken but can be improved. And it's the sum of my...which is very succinct. You know. Everything is broken and can be improved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah. Do you see it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">[02:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">RESPONDENT: That's what I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, he finds something audacious about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, although I so often assume that, but it'll come in to versus [inaudible 03:07]. Like his most recent one, he's been working on this model for game play. And really has been spending days on it. He was stuck on this one problem for like two days and had not been able to solve. I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">telling him like, like go ahead and try this. Try this. You should try this thing. Here's what you should be doing. These are all the things he's tried already for the past two days and he's just like, \"Yep.\" Hmm, alright well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">[03:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">Part of the assumption for years he had to do this talk without having any idea what he was talking about on various subjects. Any subject. He'd be like, ah, this [inaudible 03:50]; he'd go actually it's this. He's just like going off and making up this thing and he assumed was how it was happening. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">After a point, it's just like you don't know what you're talking about. And he realizes that nobody listened to him anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">INTERVIEWER: Oh, no one took him seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, because like you always talk about things you don't understand; shit you just made up on the fly. You think people [inaudible 04:12] don't know further understanding of the subject. And obviously incorrect. Obviously those of us who know something about the subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">So that's funny actually. He would jump in doing that so often but be wrong whereas, listen, he might jump in; he's still right. He'd already done the thing but I was still right. He's like, here's what you're doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560021\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">And the thing he wouldn't do...he was like you should stop now. You should work on something else. You've been working on this for two days. Where is your progress? You're stuck now. You're locked in a pattern and you need to step away and work on something else and you'll get a new perspective on it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">He was like, \"No. I'm not going to do it.\" I'm like if I were your producer I would have scheduled you on to something else already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">[05:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">INTERVIEWER: Oh, interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, whereas before I would have found somebody who could solve your problem for you. But failing that, I would move him to something else. Because he's a wasted resource right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">RESPONDENT: Two days of nothing. Maybe he can do something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">INTERVIEWER: That's a great idea. That's a great call though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, what else can you do? Well we need to get this done. It's not going to happen today. It's not going to have somebody figure it out. [inaudible 05:28] player come to think of it. Like no, \"Two more days. Two more days.\" It's like it's been two weeks. This guy hasn't figured this thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">out. What else could we have been using him for in that time? It's not like it takes two weeks to write up this code. Right. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">INTERVIEWER: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">[05:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">RESPONDENT: You can write code all day and you can write systems and complexes over the course of weeks. But when it's one feature you're working on, you know, and this thing...then that's the problem. The problem is you aren't getting it done because you don't know how to do it. And if you knew how <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">to do it, you'd just do it. You need somebody to teach you how to do it, you won't be given the time to learn it, you know. You need to know the answers today. Nothing has changed and I still don't know the answer. It's like I'm not going to get better at programming than I was two weeks ago. I'm not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">any smarter than I was two weeks ago. I'm actually more stressed than I was two weeks. My morale is lower than it was two weeks ago. I'm stressed more than I was two weeks ago. And now I'm not working anywhere near as well as I was two weeks ago and I'm not going to improve on this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">INTERVIEWER: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">RESPONDENT: And the problem was no, get it done, get it done. Like that...it got worse. It got something. Is, in fact, an answer. And that's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">INTERVIEWER: That's the problem actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">RESPONDENT: It's a television movie problem, right. People want you to tell them reasons and...you're watching tv shows and movies where bosses act as far as that, \"Get it done. Get results.\" It's on Star Trek. It's on Law and Order. It's like all over the place. We can't do this thing. \"Get it done.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">And it's like that's the magic word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">[07:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">INTERVIEWER: That's the magic word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">RESPONDENT: Get it done. Or like just do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">INTERVIEWER: Push through it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">RESPONDENT: \"I don't want to hear excuses. I just want results.\" These are things you hear in television and movies that actually don't work in the real world because they're ridiculous. Right. And so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">INTERVIEWER: That's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">RESPONDENT: But people are just like, \"Oh, I've seen this. I've seen this happen.\" It's like oh, you lied on your resume; you're fired. No. Why? Why are we doing that? Is he good at his job? Well yeah. Okay. Fine. Did he lie about not being a convicted murderer? No. Oh okay. Because we would have found <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">out. Yeah you know. Why? \"Well that's just what happens.\" You saw that in some movie right? You heard that passed down from the old business time, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560021\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">INTERVIEWER: That's important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">RESPONDENT: It's like why? Why would you do this? Because it's always been done that way. Has it? I don't think it has actually. I really very much doubt that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah. It's a kind of knee jerk, unthought of reflexive way to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, based on some media story you once heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">[08:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">You know and...media story; based on a story you once heard. It's fucking stupid is what it is. And like that's the problem with this. I'm like okay am I manic when I think people are stupid or am I correct and the people are stupid? Right. Like I was watching Silver Linings Playbook yesterday. Okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">That was a difficult movie to watch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. Yeah, for a couple of different reasons. So 1; that's a real feature film in that it features gravity [inaudible 08:44] Jennifer Lawrence. Everyone else; well, Robert DeNiro. Everyone else you don't really hear about. Robert DeNiro, by the way, does not steal scenes. He's not a gifted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">actor. He's Robert DeNiro. You know, he does a really good Robert DeNiro in various situations and anger very well. And he needs that. But anger is so easy to do. Robert is just good at it. You know. And he's not bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">INTERVIEWER: Who?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">RESPONDENT: Robert DeNiro.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">INTERVIEWER: Oh yeah, DeNiro.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">RESPONDENT: He's certainly not bad. He's very good. But he didn't steal a scene. And look at Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are put right in front. They're both beautiful, right? I mean Julia Stiles off to the side, I go yeah, yeah; see, there are other people. You know, Julia Stiles. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">you've seen her in stuff, right. She is what? Cooper's ex or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">INTERVIEWER: Oh is she really? Oh, in the movie you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">[09:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">RESPONDENT: No, she's his ex's friend and the wife of his other really good friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">INTERVIEWER: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, so she's in it. But anyway, it's really just there to show off these two. So no one else really detracts from it. Regardless, the scene I was looking at have you seen it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">INTERVIEWER: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">RESPONDENT: The scene I was looking for is wedding video. That [inaudible 10:01] is very real and very accurate. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">RESPONDENT: That's very real and very accurate. Except that I did...I wish they had not made him violent. I didn't want them to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">INTERVIEWER: When was he violent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">[10:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">RESPONDENT: He accidentally hit his mother, you know. He actually hit his mother and his dad starts punching...starts punching his dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">INTERVIEWER: Oh yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">RESPONDENT: I didn't want it to go that way. I didn't want it to be like the reason he gets out is because he's violent. I didn't want that to be...again, he's Bipolar I right. That's what he's being; he's Bipolar...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">INTERVIEWER: The director's son is Bipolar I.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">RESPONDENT: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">INTERVIEWER: The director's son has Bipolar.

The kid's fat. Give him a workout regimen. You shouldn't have fat kids. When a kid's fat, old people should get off [inaudible 11:04]. Kids should not be fat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, he's a...yeah, but Brad Cooper plays a Bipolar I.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, and Jennifer Lawrence plays...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">INTERVIEWER: Depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">[11:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.

Yeah, I think she's great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">INTERVIEWER: What did you think of Bradley Cooper?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">RESPONDENT: Oh he's good. I like him. I think [inaudible 11:46]. I think the movie is surprisingly contrived in certain areas. Like the movie is doing well in like...oh, and this thing. That's a romantic comedy show. Why is that...why would that...and it only works in romantic comedy. Why did you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">bring it in to this actual character setting that we're doing right now? They get a 5 at the Dance. I'm sorry; that's...I'm sorry. What do we do? What are we...? This is not serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">[12:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">But the scene of him signing in to the doctor's office is actually the most accurate but also symbolic representation of what it's like. Okay. So he walks in; he signs his name on the sheet. He remains still signing the sheet. So [inaudible 12:47] acting. The camera continues to spin around him but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">not in a feeling way. Right. And so this is one...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">INTERVIEWER: This is the one that you see in the outpatient guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">RESPONDENT: Yes. You look at the secretary; the secretary is much lower than he is, right. She's very plain. Right. And the light is off somehow. You know. That's the most accurate representation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, what did you...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">RESPONDENT: You're still aware of many many many things. It's moving quickly. But this mundane task seems so ridiculous, you know. The secretary is plainer. She's not the flawless, stick out, at least to me that's how I experience it is that everything that is broken is more clearly broken. And people <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">that are playing are not as smart or not as talented, [inaudible 13:59] seem more so and more so and more so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">[14:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">Did I tell you this? That Charles asked me if I was likely Bipolar and I told him can I ask you something [inaudible 14:12]? But he was very good. I thought those were the two most correct, accurate depictions of it. He goes more extreme.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">INTERVIEWER: The hospital scene?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">RESPONDENT: The outpatient one. I mean yeah the outpatient looking for the wedding video. Until it culminated in the [inaudible 14:40] cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">INTERVIEWER: My stuff doesn't get physical. [inaudible 14:49]. What about the...what was the scene? I don't remember the scene where he's looking for the video tape very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">RESPONDENT: He's looking for his wedding video and it's not where he put it. And he needs to find it. And they won't tell him where it is. Clearly they know where it is. He just needs to find it because it's [inaudible 15:15] should or shouldn't. These are very single facts that he can't understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">why is it taking him so long to figure out where it is or to understand what happened to it. Why is it taking so long? Because everyone is so slow. And it's infuriating how long it's taking everyone because...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560021\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">INTERVIEWER: Slow and stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">RESPONDENT: Infuriating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I thought like one of the things he was getting pissed about was they thought they knew better for what he needed at that moment. No, I needed to see the video.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">RESPONDENT: And like he probably doesn't remember that. I told [inaudible 16:04] yesterday the first four years like, the last four years I made a number of choices based on manic thinking. Like [inaudible 16:17]. And she was like that would seem accurate. I'm like what the fuck. She's like that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">what I thought was happening. Well then why did you let it happen? If you saw this happening, why didn't you say don't do this; this is a bad choice. This is based on irrational thinking. And I think it's just more scary that she will let me do things that are destructive. She was like I've always voiced <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D32\">my concerns. I'm like yeah, but then you go away. You know. That's not passivity. It is what it is. It is what it is. [inaudible 17:18], it is what it is. It isn't what it is. What can it be? That's the question. What can it be? What should it be? And how do we get it closer to that state? These are the questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">[17:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">INTERVIEWER: You would have liked her to retrospectively say like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">RESPONDENT: I told her like the next time this happens you need to say this is a decision based on irrational thinking because you are manic right now; depressed. And when I tell you and prove to you that's not true logically, you need to point out the symptoms I'm exhibiting. My speaking is much faster. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">Right, my emotional state is heightened. You know, these are things you need to point out to me. You are clearly manic right now and you need not to make this choice. You need to sit down and think about it. She's like I don't say those things. I'm like you need to say those things. I can't believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D92\">you would let me do things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">INTERVIEWER: Do you think you were manic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">RESPONDENT: I mean that's why I look back on those; thinking that I was so good that I could start a company, you know. But thinking that it mattered how insane [inaudible 18:36] was and it mattered how insane Lauren was. Like here's what I have to look at guys. Either, there's something wrong with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">me, right. If you are the common factor in all of the failed relationships, right...I left the last three places I've been. The first one I had a safety net. The second and third I did not when I left them. So and the question remains. Were these places really as toxic as I felt they were when I left? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD2\">If I'm honest, maybe. A lot of people were upset. A lot of people were leaving. And it changed very drastically. Okay. So is that a possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">[19:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">The companies; a lot of people left. All three places I left under very high turnover rate. So what does that mean? And is it that I'm crazy and like I can't do this anymore? Or is it that I do not deal at all well with irrational behavior to the point where I will leave? You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I get the feeling that it was from that place that I mean you talked about here in a lot of detail that you found that it was very very hard to deal with irrational people. It was maddening to you. And what I also think is that you deliberated a while on each one. It was not like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">I'm leaving today. I also think that you felt; I mean you thought it through a lot here and talked about it. I think there was also the idea that as it was before that a lot of prospects were coming your way. You know, you were getting a lot of things dropped in your lap for jobs and I mean yeah; I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E32\">think there's something here for us to talk about and to work on in terms of because you're going to run in to any number of crazy bosses. But I also think you were trying to look for a place that felt better; that you felt like all it takes is one good boss in the world and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560021\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">RESPONDENT: All it takes is one good boss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">INTERVIEWER: Let me tell you, that's what a lot of people I find I work with do; they keep going until they find some place that really fits them better; and it's hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">[21:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">RESPONDENT: So then I struggle low interesting as a matter of reality. What does physics tell us? What does modern physics tell us? That the universe is a wave of potentiality. That it collapses in attention matter when attention is turned towards it. It's a very succinct way in your stride...currently <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">[inaudible 22:13]. The universe is a wave of potentiality. It collapses in to matter when attention is turned towards it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">INTERVIEWER: Great. How can you use that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">RESPONDENT: I don't know. Can I? Now there are things that I used to believe but that didn't manipulate it by focusing on certain realities that your realities will come to pass. But also I put in effort in to that, right. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">Experiences I had when I was younger that I could not really swing. Mythology. Mythological things. Ways to describe and explain the sort of spiritual quasi mystical things. How do I explain these things? And I don't know. And at the time I would explain whatever literature resources were available <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">to me, right. You know. Whether that was [inaudible 23:40], whether that was no pain studies. Whether that was [inaudible 23:46] library looking for something and then it was useful. And then fucking books on Shamanism. How to be a Shaman in an urban setting and books on trend modification, whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F12\">talks about trend modifications and [inaudible 24:03]. And I used a great deal of these things to describe the things I was experiencing and explain them. So then the question then becomes did I experience those things as a trick because I was looking at the mythology? Or did these things happen and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F13\">the explanations for them are based on mythology instead I should see what's actually happening. You know. Or is that all just craziness and now I'm sane. Right. And but then the issue remains. It seems that when I reason things, that my life was better. Things improved. More amazing things happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F14\">to me. And since there have been more and more focus on what is more logic than real, things have been going less well. So what does that mean? Is there a correlation then, right? Is there a correlation or is that simply coincidence that my lack of faith, I suppose, to other structures is lucid by instructions <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F15\">that I wade through at least in that [inaudible 25:32].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">[25:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">But having those or just simply [inaudible 25:40] that I've lost that and then also jobs became more scarce and three of the choices I made were not good choices. What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">You know and it's interesting. This class [inaudible 26:03]. And one of the cool things about it was that if you went too far in either direction you were useless. If you went too far in the physical world, you're not contributing to the entire picture. If you went too far in the metaphysical world, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">the same problem. And then the goals [inaudible 26:25].<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560021\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">Now, I can wonder a couple of things. One; is there something mystical to that? Is there a mystical myth to reality? Fascinating question. Right. But [inaudible 26:45]. Or rather, is it that there are scientific understandable, knowable facts that are currently described in mystical terms you do not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">have the vocabulary to do so otherwise? I'm not sure it matters, although it's [inaudible 27:07]. If there are real knowable and examinable facts, I need to be looking at that. Very very carefully. How does it work? What are the signs in attention? How can I use attention to bring about positive change <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F92\">in my life as if [inaudible 27:29]? How experience [inaudible 27:32] as if it just all happened like it was supposed to? Like things came to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">Opportunities. Being in the right place at the right time. Serendipitous experiences. You know very much like this. And they also don't believe that coincidence is a powerful thing. Right. Interesting. So what does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">[27:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">So if there is a mystical side; if there's a science that brings mystical in to it, then there's an entire other rule set that needs to be discovered and researched. Very close to it. This is a funny thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">You watched True Blood last night, right. I don't watch it often, but I used to.

Alright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">RESPONDENT: I would be an awesome vampire. So many of them fuck it up. You know. Oh, I've got these feelings and emotions that I can't [inaudible 28:36]. That is what you're going to do. But it's wrong. It's not right. I think that's Predator. That's fine. It's what you're supposed to do. That doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">mean you can't have friendships and relationships; it's just that [inaudible 28:54]. They're more than pets; you are better. But they are more intelligent than dogs. They are better in many ways. They live longer, they're faster, they're stronger. You can eat them. I can eat dogs. I've eaten lots <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201052\">of other animals. But I have dogs and would never eat them.

Oh, I've got these powers and so rarely does one character say, \"Okay, this is what we do now.\" What do you mean? Well we practice this every day. How far do these powers go? Like these are amazing, right? How strong are <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">we? Can we get stronger? How do we do that? What kills us? Okay, that's the interest.

I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201472\">like; he's like yeah [inaudible 34:03]. Jesus. Did that just fucking happen?

What happened. Seeing auras; it's never particularly good at seeing auras, although [inaudible 34:29] good people often said they did. The feeling it was very easy. We did this thing where we had two people. One people would sit down and close their eyes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">The other two people would try to feel where [inaudible 34:52] around their body. And we found concentrations of it. You know the trauma, right. And so you would take this thing and you do a quick sketch of it and you draw circles around places where there were particular amounts of trauma. And one <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F2\">of his knees and shoulder and he was like yeah; yeah, I dislocated a shoulder and now I'm an [inaudible 32:54] internally injured my knee about how many years ago. For me it was a huge thing on my chest. All of a sudden I'm like well I've been sulking for a long time. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

I really don't know. Smoking came to mind. Other than that I couldn't tell you. But yeah, I mean we don't know; we don't know the answers to these things. What happened? How did that work? That seems useful. That seems useful in diagnosis. That's a real thing. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201611\">like where are the clusters of energy. Clusters of energy around trauma. You should look at that. Right. How can we try and be able to do that? That seems very useful to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">RESPONDENT: Right. So why aren't we...well we have studied that. What do we debunked about it? We should see that. What do we experience? What actually happened? Right. That's an important issue. Talks; different talks of like [inaudible 36:52] but a woman in Russia who could slide rocks about 10 <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201651\">ft. away on the ground. Out of her mind. Okay. That's interesting. We should figure out how that happens if that's real. For the fact that very big deal means that if you prove it will be [inaudible 37:24].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">INTERVIEWER: Well yeah, all these things; there's a lot of speculation that the government was looking in to all of this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, and they found that like 60% of the accuracy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">INTERVIEWER: Did you see that movie the Men Who Stirred Goats?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">RESPONDENT: What was that about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">INTERVIEWER: I think it was the...I don't know if it was the CIA; it might have been the CIA was trying to find people who had been [inaudible 37:51].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">RESPONDENT: 60% accuracy is not really enough. Although that is apparently what is tactically radius psychic humilities. More than a 50% chance ability to predict the outcome of future events based on lack of information on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">INTERVIEWER: It would be greater than chance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">[38:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, greater than chance. It's something. [inaudible 38:12] that dude who was on TV [inaudible 38:13]. He'll give you 80% chance of accuracy; 80% accuracy. And he's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">INTERVIEWER: Oh is that right? Is that John...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">RESPONDENT: John Edwards I think. Yeah. So a couple of things. Either he's talking to ghosts. B.) Not ghosts, but those people in our life hanging around us in some sort of electromagnetic or some other force we don't understand yet. It can be interpreted by certain people who have a particular sensitivity <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B1\">to those. B.)

But which of those three or an unknown fourth that is, is extremely important to understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">INTERVIEWER: Rather than say, \"It is what it is?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">RESPONDENT: It is what it is. Well what the fuck is it? Unchangeable. Nothing is unchangeable. There's no real constant except those we find in physics and even those we don't fully understand. Fucking equations for nuclear force magnetic force gravity. Those equations are all shared. Right. That same <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201811\">equation. And we go out; that's how we know these forces all behave similarly around different things. But the equation only works because of E. This is not the same E as E=mx2 (squared). This is E, which is like [inaudible 40:03] 1.97 something. It's some number that you multiply everything by and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201812\">just do the equation or else it doesn't work. So what is that number? It's a very strange number. What's to say about our accounting system? That's such a weird number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">Let's look first [inaudible 40:25] this funny little trick. Okay. So I have this friend in college [inaudible 40:34]. It's like [inaudible 40:42]. He said [inaudible 40:44] time based 12. He's like everything times 12. But we do, not 10; the universe is based on 12. He's like so okay. Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">Now, so I played the base 12 model for a while, but you know...and you have to make up two imaginary numbers to get 2010.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">INTERVIEWER: Oh. Uh huh. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">RESPONDENT: 2012 is now 10. And it does some interesting things. The most interesting thing about it...so in base 12 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, alpha beta, 10 right. Half of 10 is 6. Right. Half of 10 is 6 in this. When you calculate pi in base 12, instead of 3.14 and whatever, you get 2.64, exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201891\">perfectly 2 1\/2.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">INTERVIEWER: Two and 2 2\/3.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">[41:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">RESPONDENT: [inaudible 41:54].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">INTERVIEWER: Oh is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">RESPONDENT: Six bar. It's base 12 times 10 is 6.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">INTERVIEWER: But it's six bar, so it's six repeating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, six forever. Infinitely 2 1\/2. Perfectly 2 1\/2.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">INTERVIEWER: Just not like 2.55? It wouldn't be like 2.6666.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">RESPONDENT: I guess it would. 2.6666666.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">INTERVIEWER: It would be a little bit more. But it still gets us...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">RESPONDENT: I suppose that's true. Very close. But also much more usable number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">INTERVIEWER: But it's a lot easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">RESPONDENT: Yeah. That's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">INTERVIEWER: That is interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">RESPONDENT: It is. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">INTERVIEWER: I've heard that. I've heard even base 6 is interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">RESPONDENT: Well there you go. I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, and base 6 would be similar to 12.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">RESPONDENT: That's interesting. So what does that say? Does that mean anything? Are we doing math wrong? Would we be better in math [inaudible 43:01]? Or we'd be like, oh no, this works now. Oh, look at that. It works. Yeah, math is the language we use to interpret value. Music is the way math sounds. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B31\">Huh? Interesting isn't it? The way math sounds. But again, what if those things are real? This is where I struggle. Which of these things are real?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">[43:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">So I started meditated to see what I could gain from that. Even Sam Harris agrees that meditation is useful. I can do that. Mystical world says that meditation is [inaudible 43:58] meditation is useful, therefore I should go and do meditation.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560021\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B9\">INTERVIEWER: Oh yeah. It's funny; I was thinking about you as being a select candidate for Yoga.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">RESPONDENT: I thought about Yoga and actually would like doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">RESPONDENT: I really ought to, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">INTERVIEWER: I think it would be interesting to see what it would do for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">RESPONDENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">INTERVIEWER: I think it's fine for [inaudible 44:24].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">RESPONDENT: Probably. I could really stand to be more flexible. Hurting myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C9\">INTERVIEWER: Huh, it'll do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB\">RESPONDENT: Yeah, it builds all the right muscles too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CD\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah. It's also very interesting for the mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CF\">RESPONDENT: That's what I understand. I hear that. Breathing. We're trying the following breath thing [inaudible 44:47]. Zen, I think is his last name. He's a logical realist, a mediator guy who put out a lot of books and a lot of seminars. So I watched a little quick thing with him. He talks about <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201CF1\">following your breath and following...and more meditation that's not for me to think [inaudible 45:04] around the thoughts of [inaudible 45:08]. Being able to see [inaudible 45:09].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D1\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D3\">RESPONDENT: I don't know; that's very interesting. Like I do stuff like that. Sometimes in the right state of tiredness or bed, I try to detach myself [inaudible 45:23] and just see where they go. Then I fall asleep watching them. I had a friend to do it too. He called it coming attractions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D5\">INTERVIEWER: So you didn't tell me what [inaudible 45:34].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D7\">RESPONDENT: So you're in bed and you'll close your eyes and things come across [inaudible 45:43].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">INTERVIEWER: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB\">RESPONDENT: And you just let those shapes and holds as far as you trying to follow them and crystallize them or make them go to some other state; control where they go. You simply let those things happen. That's a very interesting thing [inaudible 46:03]. So like come on when it happens. So it's like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB1\">oh okay, that's interesting. Maybe that's when [inaudible 46:07] something like that. So I was trying to do; trying to do it every night now and I fall asleep. I don't know. That's a pretty common thing. I was trying to do it on the train here. I always follow my breath while sitting on the train. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB2\">And some of these click and make sense or when he said breathing the things some of you do without thinking about it. Something happens regardless of what we're doing. Right. Really, I felt I never understood that. I felt my body breathing regardless of me and that was very interesting. So I'll keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB3\">working at that. And that works before we understand it. How else can it work? I always want to take it to mean more than what else can we do? I want to figure out what else can we do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DD\">[47:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DF\">INTERVIEWER: Yeah, it's interesting how with Yoga and well you know it's funny. I guess like acupuncture is some way of getting that, the idea of energy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E1\">RESPONDENT: Well there's some science to that. I understand [inaudible 47:34] talk that...yeah, so acupuncture is really [inaudible 47:37] with your body.

That's what...they cited some study where that happened. So there are meridian lines. That happens. I'm like okay that makes sense to me. That makes sense to me. The fact there's a field around people that can be seen. Where I have problems with the <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E51\">aura people is that saying it means this.

Exactly. And that's the problem. And the problem I ran into. I was just trying to explain how these things happen. But after a while you're like, okay, these things I'm thinking of are really far out. Like these can't be accurate. Right. Like or the world would be different. You know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201F11\">So what's...so what is happening? So what is happening? So what has happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F3\">INTERVIEWER: Well that's interesting.
