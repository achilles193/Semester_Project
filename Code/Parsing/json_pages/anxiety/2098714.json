I don't even know how I feel, I guess bogged down or I guess not knowing what to do or if they're better at, I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">know, spending their time or if they have more interests or, I don't know, yeah.

Let's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F1\">get focused on work and what's next and wondering what other people are thinking and how they're feeling and are they feeling what I'm feeling?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098714\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Right.

I'm just like, I don't know, I guess changed to see what it's like for other people to see if there's something I can change in myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: But I think it's more just like, me just not knowing what to do. Like I want to feel productive and like, yeah, I have work to do but sometimes I don't or sometimes I'm just feeling like tired and not wanting to do it. So it's just kind of like what do I do and I mean, yeah. (PAUSE) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: I guess for you like in a way sort of the both like the magical yet frustrating question is what do you do. Like if you did the right thing or if you knew what to do, this would be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Right or yeah, just be okay with not doing anything or, I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: It's like if you could get the right answer to that question at a particular moment, things will be at least better but at least okay, not okay or good. Like you know you can take it easy and that's the thing to do or you know you should be working on A, B, C, D, or E that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: That's what would help is knowing what to do at any given moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Right. I think it's just like feeling like motivation. Like even if I have like (SIGH) something to do... Like I do a lot of art extractions at work and it's very like tedious monotonous and when I had a lot to do I kind of feel motivated to do it and like get it done but like every once in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">a while someone will bring me a couple samples and it's just like, \"I don't want to do this because like...\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">So it's kind of that feeling of not wanting to do it or whatever. So... But, you know, this time I don't have much else to do or like, you know, it's just I guess weird. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I guess to me it seems like things going on in your emotional life interfering with your motivation or you're having a clear sense of what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Right. (PAUSE) Yeah. And they... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">Yeah, I guess I get mad that I don't want to do it well or, I don't know. Whatever. You know? I'm not productive or efficient or something and, yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah, I guess I get angry that I am, I don't know, not motivated or tired or, I don't know.

What's going on in front of the curtain is like the performance, you know and what's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">going on backstage is everything that's sort of is involved in, leads up to, is required for performing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">You get focused on what's going on in front of the curtain and whether that's what it should be or not. I think in part, because there's something certainly more familiar probably also a bit more comfortable even if it feels crummy which I know it does, as compared to looking more behind the curtain. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">Like, in other words, okay. So, you know. Why don't you feel like studying? Why are you distracted. I'm sure you're just feeling tired. You probably had a long day and you probably had to do a bunch of art (inaudible) extractions which are boring and monotonous and, you know, you're not really sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C12\">about this med school thing in the first place and that fucker of a dean last year told you that, you know, you weren't, you know, going to be a good applicant and so it's demoralizing and you're nervous because what if you put in all this work, you know, and it doesn't pan out? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">And you're screwed either because you really don't know what to do or you've stuck money into a post doc program or just time and energy into this. I mean, I don't know if these are... Obviously I don't know if these are sort of what's going on but I, you know, it's something we've talked about it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">could be contributing and it seems to me like... (PAUSE) On one hand, I can imagine you could be worried that you could get mired in those and that could take you even further away from getting your homework done and doing any studying you were intending to do. At the same time, it seems to me you kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C32\">of almost feel like you shouldn't feel them or you should sort of closet them because, you know, you should just be able to suck it up and do the work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: But I guess I sort of feel like after a point it kind of doesn't work like that so much any more. I mean, once you've been sucking it up for long enough and there's enough has kind of built up back there, it really gets in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I guess it's sort of a concern I had about something that's happening to you or it seems to me it could be happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think I know about those things or I don't consciously. I don't think I think about them like when I was studying the class. I think it's more like why am I not encoding these things more perfectly. Yeah. It's more like, yeah, why am I not like smart enough or like not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">have the knowledge to kind of like encode what I'm studying better in a knowledgeable way or remember it forever or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098714\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">It's like I'm just being critical of every step or something or maybe like I resent like that I didn't study better when I was in college or something like... I don't know. Just kind of like criticizing my method or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah it sounds like you sort of have this like internal tough softball coach or something like that who's saying like... This is what you're describing I think like, \"Why aren't you smarter than this? Why aren't you remembering this better? You should, you know, this should be this hard. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">You should be able to learn this better.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: \"What's going on?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: It's just kind of like, I guess, you know like they say like, \"Oh, you have to have the mindset.\" Like why don't I have the, you know, the mind for this where I just kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, see. I guess, you may be right but I'm going to take some convincing. In part because like my understanding is that in college you did pretty well with fairly similar or at least analogous material at times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Right. I mean, I did do well but, I don't know, I just. Yeah. Talking to other people, they have like more like larger grasp of things and I'm just good at memorizing details like... Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Or maybe I'm better at recall, I don't know, without reasoning or, I don't know, higher process thinking. I don't know. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Again though, I imagine there are times when you've done that pretty well. I mean, the papers or the experiments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: I guess. I think it's harder for me. Yeah I could, yeah loss what I want to say or something. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Well I'm going to still take some convincing because I think what you're describing... I think your style is a little more on the obsessional side. I don't mean you're OCD. It's nothing like that. I mean, that particularly when you're sort of under stress or feeling lower or more anxious, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">you're inclined to sort of focus on the details and the small picture and like are pushing yourself and thinking about your standards and so forth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">Rather than, you know, I'm sure other people are kind of opposite like under pressure or when they're feeling low or anxious tend to be more impressionistic like forget about the details and just step back from everything or, you know, kind of avoid things, like avoid the particulars. My impression <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">is that's probably more in response to emotionally what's going on than to a sort of like fundamental lack of capacity to think quicker or to put details together. But I guess I'm not sure because that's not something we talked a lot about but I guess I have a little bit of a hard time imagining you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB2\">could get through, you know, like a really good school doing pretty well just because you can... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">I mean, I believe you can memorize things well and you're good at sort of learning details like that but... And I'd be willing to believe that some of the more, some of the higher level thinking stuff or more synthetic stuff, you know, is relatively more difficult for you. But I guess I'm really just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">not willing to believe that you're not good at is so much as there's something emotional going on that interferes with your ability to do that when you're having a harder time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098714\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I'm not saying I could never be convinced otherwise but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: I don't know.

Like were there classes or semesters or even times through high school where or for that matter, you know... Well, let's just stick with school for now. That this kind of thing was easier and other kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">things were harder or has it been pretty consistent? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: I think in high school I was fine. Like I, I don't know, had more of an opinion or something or... Yeah, I was fine at writing. I don't know. In college... I don't know. Maybe it was more daunting or something. I don't know. (PAUSE) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: You were more intimidated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Right or I think it's always like I missed my window. (LAUGHTER) Like, I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">Like I always felt, you know, if I was better educated when I was younger, these things would be easier like I missed the, the window or something. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: I see. Like there's a sensitive period to learning how to write a thesis and develop and argument in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: Right or I missed the, some of the basics, kind of just like I jumped forward into school and, you know, it's hard to make up for lost time or like things that I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: ...didn't know or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Like if you didn't crank out a lot of five paragraph essays in middle schools and then write a bunch of, you know, short term papers in high school then by the time you get to college and you have to write, you know, a twenty page term paper, if you don't have the right foundation skills <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">to do that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: Right? I think there was a lot of thinking that the window's gone or something but I could always, I guess catch up or do fine with, you know, science or, you know... Or, I mean, I liked it so I could memorize it or I could learn it or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: Did you not go through very good schools growing up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: I mean, a public school was good for Idaho but I think Idaho is low on the education list.
