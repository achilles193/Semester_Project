Either one of these chairs. I know, I re-did the configuration. I still keep this chair, so either chair that works for you, go for. They\u2019re basically the same.

How far do you have to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Uh, a little bit on the highway. (client responds) They plow the highways. (client responds) I\u2019m not too worried. (pause) Welcome back! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Thank you! This chair is much higher. It\u2019s different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it is different. I\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t like, I tried to (inaudible) (blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: No, no. you told me it was happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Oh, I did tell you? Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, plus you had these little stickers on the wall, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) For the pink colors, yeah, which aren\u2019t done yet, but they\u2019re almost done.

And actually a little bit more artwork next week, but after that, then it\u2019s all done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: How long was it in the works?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Uh, I think I just ordered this stuff a couple of months ago. It takes a while ago to get in, but, you know... I ordered it a few months ago and it came a week ago, maybe, a week and a half ago. So... different, right? (client affirms) The chairs are higher, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">[pause 00:01:45 to 00:02:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: So, I guess last time we left off on something that you suggested we needed to revisit. (pause) You know, it\u2019s been a couple of weeks. It\u2019s hard to like, jump right back into the middle of something. (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: (pause) That\u2019s why I typically don\u2019t say, \u201cLast week, we left off with...\u201d (client chuckles) It seems a little bit artificial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: But it was on your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. (therapist responds) Yeah. (pause) You know, I think you said something to the effect of, \u201cThis seems so important. We need to come back to this.\u201d Or that word may be different, \u201cneed,\u201d but... So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">[pause 00:03:08 to 00:03:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">I\u2019m going to sit this way, because otherwise I\u2019ll get distracted by your books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll like, look away. (pause) I want to look that way, and there are the books. I\u2019ll start reading the titles and I\u2019ll get stuck there. (chuckles) (pause) (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Do you think today is harder than other days?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: (pause) Um, than some other days. I know that it\u2019s harder than any other day when I\u2019ve come back and it\u2019s been, you know, two weeks since I\u2019ve seen you or really sit and... Anytime that I\u2019ve gone away and then come back; but I guess those are the same thing. (therapist responds) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">[pause 00:04:52 to 00:05:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">Yeah, so normally, I would adjust to new surroundings by talking with you about it a little bit, I think. I\u2019m not unwilling to talk about it, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561600\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m certainly not unwilling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: But you\u2019re also... (pause) not giving the normal \u201cYes, I\u2019m interested in talking about myself\u201d cues that one would give, so like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Like, what would those cues be? Maybe you cue me, maybe I can cue you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: (laughs) So I asked you, you know, if this has been in the works for a long time. You sort of gave the \u201cMeh, yeah, worked on it for a little while.\u201d Then we... there was no like, \u201cYes, this was something I was excited about,\u201d or \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d It was just like, \u201cThis is a thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">I do every, possibly every, more than a year,\u201d or \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve decorated my office the way I really wanted to. I have this lovely new carpet that has these colors that are fantastic...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I see. So I wasn\u2019t, I was sort of... conic (ph) in my response?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s a fun word. (therapist responds) (pause) Which... which I interpret in the sense of, \u201cYes, this is what we did, but this is not why we\u2019re here. So, why don\u2019t we move to why we\u2019re here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Oh, I\u2019m very curious about your, I mean, it\u2019s a very different room! (chuckles) So, I\u2019m absolutely curious about your experience. I didn\u2019t have that much to say on my end, because... I was really, \u201cOh, I have to say I really like it,\u201d but we were just, didn\u2019t have that much to say on my end, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">but that\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not curious about what your experience is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (pause) (laughs) Um, and so... (laughs) My experience is that our conversations are exactly like that, almost all the time. You\u2019re very kind, but you also... (pause) quickly deflect any discussion that would relate to you towards my experience of you, or the surroundings or et cetera, so that\u2019s... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: So would it, is it about, if I would talk more about myself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: (sighs) (pause) I don\u2019t know. I think that... (pause) I typically attribute to you intentionality in most of what you say, because I think you are fairly intentional about what you do and don\u2019t say, and... And so... even if not in the specific moment, I think there is a sort of method to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">way you approach these sessions. Maybe I\u2019m making that up, but, um, I... sort of assume that you went to school for a long time to learn a specific like, skill set and practice it a whole lot. So... I feel like I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201cbetter.\u201d Certainly interesting things come out of, um... this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200692\">discussion might be of some interest... but that\u2019s why you get the leather chair. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: (both chuckle) You think the leather chair is better? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: You don\u2019t like the leather chair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s... no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Seems (inaudible). Well, the... I can\u2019t remember if you kept that or not, because it was out of my field of vision (therapist affirms), you did keep that one also?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s actually, that\u2019s a good one, that\u2019s a Herman Miller chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Sorry. I was gesturing at the desk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Oh, no, the desk actually is new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Okay. It didn\u2019t look the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: The desk was awful, the last desk was terrible. (client chuckles) It was really not good. It was a crappy IKEA desk, (client laughs) (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: But you kept these two pieces of furniture, so I assumed you liked that chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561600\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been a good orthopedic chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERPIST: So... sort of, because I\u2019m in it most, a lot of the day, so... (client laughs) But it seems like when we go... one of the things that I\u2019ve observed is when you go away and come back, that there is, the relationship feels a little more awkward, or just is feels a little more lopsided or... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">And so it\u2019s kind of hard to know how to get into the rhythm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Um, for you, or for me, or both?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: I was actually commenting more on you, but maybe that\u2019s not fair. Maybe it\u2019s maybe both of us, and maybe that\u2019s more fair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: (laughs) I mean, I certainly feel more awkward after I haven\u2019t seen you for a while, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, I get that sense, I get that sense. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, well how do we do this again?\u201d I get that sense. (client affirms) Is that my being, I mean, yeah, I\u2019m not terribly chatty. It\u2019s true! (chuckles) And so, that part of it is, that\u2019s maybe not even a good way of saying it, \u201cI\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">not terribly chatty.\u201d I mean, there is more to it than just that, but that\u2019s just, you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Is that you in general, or is that just how you conduct the sessions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Probably both, probably both. I certainly wouldn\u2019t describe myself as chatty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: (laughs) Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: (pause) But I guess one of the things that I think, I\u2019m thinking about now, is that it\u2019s not about how sort of, how the session is going, but that you, that maybe you\u2019re feeling a sense of sort of awkwardness, or just like, trying to get back into something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">[pause 00:11:40 to 00:12:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">[pause 00:12:00 to 00:12:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">Yeah, I think there, I mean... I don\u2019t have a handle on all of it. I think some of it is more general features of me, and not seeing people for a while, there is sort of a... a disconnect or something. (therapist responds) In this specific relationship, there are also sort of like, I am thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">what things will I tell you, or should I tell you, or will I want to talk about with you when I don\u2019t see you. Then when I see you, there are all of these things that I could talk about, but then like, the reality of you is different from... (pause) my mental \u201cnot image\u201d of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Different in particular ways? Or just...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Well, (chuckles) um... (pause) Knowing that I am not particularly good at predicting what, how you\u2019re going to respond to anything, I don\u2019t construct a response from you when I think about wanting to tell you about something. That\u2019s what I meant by \u201cnot image.\u201d (therapist responds) So like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">the presence of you as, you know, real is very different from there not being (chuckles) any response. So it\u2019s... So I think there is that going on, too, but... (therapist responds) (pause) I think this time, it\u2019s been a little bit more jarring. I... um... (chuckles) I think I used that outlet on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F2\">wall in the same way that I use normal social cues in this relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s about there, in respect, in relation to you when you\u2019re sitting in this chair, so like, that\u2019s where I would end up looking most of the time. So it\u2019s sort of like, I think in normal, normal well, this is, there is nothing abnormal about this relationship... Any relationship with a friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">who I haven\u2019t seen for a while I would... (pause) There would be small talk (chuckles) in the way that was perhaps awkward this time. Some of that awkwardness (or all of it, or whatever), is related to me, but normally we find something that sort of catches, and then (therapist responds) move along <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A32\">into a normal conversation, which I think is a thing you have recognized also.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561600\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019ve lost some visual orientation? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (therapist responds) That\u2019s the short way of saying (chuckles) everything I just said, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: But I was using the visual orientation in place of... apparently in place of a different sort of orientation I usually have. So, I don\u2019t meet with most friends in the same place every time, but we sort of maybe go through similar patterns of conversation. (therapist responds) (pause) But I find <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">my patterns of conversation awkward, so... Say hello, and then sit here for a little while, and then eventually I start talking. But that\u2019s awkward for me under normal circumstances, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re like, you look for something that\u2019s familiar, and so in this situation, familiarity is less the pattern and more of our conversation, or something like that, but more just sort of visually, that there is some orientation there that\u2019s been kind of thrown off kilter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: I think so? (therapist responds) I was not aware that was what was going on until I kept looking over here. (therapist responds) There are books instead of an outlet, which obviously...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something that was familiar that became different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it\u2019s very pretty, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Thank you. I know that, but... (client laughs) it can be disorientating at first. I\u2019m facing a different part of the room, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Is that weird for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s different, but I don\u2019t know if it was weird. It was definitely different. It was an adjustment and now I actually like it. So... It\u2019s different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">[pause 00:17:05 to 00:17:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">I mean, one way to put it very simply is, it\u2019s hard for you to focus on yourself first. (pause) Like, you... There is sort of a... surveying isn\u2019t quite the right word, but there is kind of a feeling of like, needing to be grounded, or something in some fashion, and then the settling in after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think all of that is... about right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Uh-hmm. And there are something if we go for a week without meeting, then some, like a pattern, even a pattern feels like it\u2019s, was, not broken a little bit, but just somehow disrupted, maybe. Whereas from week to week, the pattern feels a little bit more regular. So not, the not going for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">a week without seeing each other, and then also sort of the different orientation, I feel like it\u2019s kind of a double whammy. (client affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">[pause 00:18:36 to 00:19:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: You know, even week to week, it\u2019s more awkward than, at the beginning of the sessions than at the end of the sessions, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I know, that\u2019s always one of the reasons that I thought that your coming more than once a week would be helpful, actually. (client responds) Which, I mean, that\u2019s true in, I mean, in general. For some people, it\u2019s even, you know, more particular to them. (client responds) I mean, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C71\">we do very good work once a week, so (chuckles), it\u2019s not that I feel like it\u2019s suffering in any way, but that continuity can be actually very grounding for people.

I know we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t ask you very many questions about it. But we\u2019ve, you know, we\u2019ve talked about that some. (therapist responds) Now this, you know, this whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">wall of books that are like, more or less in my field of view, is information about you that has not been accessible before, but it\u2019s sort of like... it\u2019s there in the... the easy way? (therapist responds) Like, I can just look and read it, rather than having to talk with you about who you are, so... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB2\">(therapist responds) That\u2019s also distracting. (therapist responds) I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s more so or less so than the visual thing, but certainly my habit in talking with you of looking that way is compounded there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Hmm, uh-hmm. Maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: What\u2019s not a bad thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Well like, I mean, one way of framing it is a distraction, but sort of, there is some curiosity there, maybe some feeling that like, some way of being able to sate that curiosity by seeing what I read, or at least what books I own, (client chuckles) the same thing as what I read.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: (laughs) Or at least what books you\u2019ve brought here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: What books, exactly. (client chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">[pause 00:21:54 to 00:23:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: So, I was thinking about... You were suggesting that I find it hard to talk about myself first. That\u2019s another one of those that I sort of say, \u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s right,\u201d but I don\u2019t have very much to say about it (therapist responds), so... But it seems like that\u2019s actually something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">is very important to the work we\u2019re doing here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: (pause) When you had said, you know, where we ended last week in my saying it was, or last time, and saying it was very important, do you remember what it was, or you were just flagging it, that I had said that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Um... I mean, yes. It was this same subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERPIST: I wasn\u2019t sure if, that you were referring to that or not.

(chuckles) or... Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: No, It wasn\u2019t a test. I was just wondering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: I mean, do you remember that (therapist affirms) also? Okay, all right. Okay. (pause) What just happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: I feel like you asked me a, I don\u2019t understand what you were, what information you were trying to elicit from me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Um, I was trying to understand if you were trying to work on what we were talking about last week, or last time, or not. I was just trying to under , I was trying to just understand your thought process, I wasn\u2019t necessarily, it wasn\u2019t a test. (pause) Is that... Did that answer your question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Okay. Was there more to the question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (therapist affirms) (chuckles) Um...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">[pause 00:25:41 to 00:27:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Um, I\u2019m just reprocessing the whole thing. I feel like... When I\u2019ve been away for a while, I come in and we, it\u2019s awkward for me. So I try to make small talk and look to visual cues. We don\u2019t make small talk. That\u2019s just not (chuckles) what goes on in our interactions, usually. So then that\u2019s... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB1\">That doesn\u2019t really change the awkward level for me, so it\u2019s still awkward. So, then yes, I was trying to just, well, let\u2019s just go back to this subject. But it\u2019s a little bit artificial in the way that I tried to bring it back. And also, I... (pause) It sounds like perhaps confusing for you, as to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB2\">what exactly I\u2019m doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200FA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561600\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, in a sense, one way we can make it less awkward is to talk about the awkwardness, which sounds paradoxical, but not necessarily; I mean, which is what we\u2019re doing, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: (pause) The thought that came to my mind, which was... Somewhere, I guess, I don\u2019t know if I said this in particular, a few weeks ago, but just sort of like, the permanence of things or impermanence of things... Like, I feel like when you, we go for a week or so without seeing each other, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">there is something, the permanence, it doesn\u2019t, something feels more impermanent about it? Like, you\u2019re sort of starting over, like this isn\u2019t like, something that\u2019s here and structured and you just jump back in, but it\u2019s something that needs to be re-established or recreated (client responds), that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201012\">it\u2019s not quite, I mean like, an established structure. I mean, I imagine with the sort of office being different, too, it\u2019s even more so. Yeah, you know, you\u2019re kind of, things have changed! They\u2019re not the same! (chuckles) But... they\u2019re the same (inaudible), yeah, certainly pieces of furniture are <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201013\">the same and it\u2019s the same room, but... But that\u2019s just, I sort of thought about it in that way, in terms of permanence and impermanence. (client responds) Starting over from scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">[pause 00:30:08 to 00:30:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Certainly an interesting way of thinking about it. (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">[pause 00:30:46 to 00:31:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">Yeah, I don\u2019t... (pause) I don\u2019t have a lot of thoughts in response. I think it\u2019s interesting, though. (therapist responds) You know, it\u2019s sort of, it fits my suggestion that it feels similar from week to week, in that there is something that must be re-built in that language, or that it\u2019s re-build <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201091\">more quickly in a week (therapist responds), or from week to week, but... (pause) I don\u2019t know; I guess I feel that way about my work, also. So, when I go away from it for a couple of weeks, I have to get back into it, or find my way back into it, so... (pause) So I don\u2019t know what that... (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201092\">responds) I don\u2019t know what that means. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: (pause) I\u2019m not sure how this fits together, but I think it does somehow, that you\u2019re also someone who very much believes in commitments, which sort of speaks to a kind of permanence. (client responds) I don\u2019t know how that fits in with this. I imagine it does somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: I like the suggestion. I have no idea how it fits in, either. (therapist responds) Or maybe you have an idea; I don\u2019t have an idea of how it fits in, but... Another feature, when I\u2019ve gone away from here, is I\u2019ve gone to a place and done a thing every time. So it\u2019s sort of like, the focus in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">my life has shifted for a while and I\u2019ve come back. So I feel like that probably plays a role also, but I don\u2019t know exactly how. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2010C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561600\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s different from this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: No, similar to this time. So this time, it was a different thing, but I went away and visited my family and Tanya\u2019s family, and then I came back, but my life here is just very different from visiting my folks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: What was it like to visit them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: It was nice. It was stressful, internally stressful, there was a lot going on. So a lot of people and there is a... (chuckles) There is a sense in which we\u2019re very similar, all of my siblings and I. I, perhaps because of our sessions, I\u2019m sort of more aware of some particular features of our <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">similarities. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: (pause) In what ways was it stressful? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: For someone who doesn\u2019t look to their own needs or desires first, there is a lot of people to try to balance their needs. No one is (or very few people, except maybe the three-year-olds), talking about what their needs or desires are, because they\u2019re all doing something similar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: And in that way, you feel similar to your siblings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That was one similarity I recognized this (therapist responds), or felt on this trip. (pause) It was perhaps the most notable in my 17-year-old brother, who like, when asked like, what he wanted, would try to find out what the majority opinion was, and align himself with that, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">that his choice had as little impact as possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: (pause) Hmm. That\u2019s (chuckles) interesting. (pause) To put it kind of not very elegantly, where do you think you guys got that from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: You know, (chuckles) the simple answer that I don\u2019t really believe, but is probably right to zeroth order, is from our mother. So, my mother is actually very similar to that, except for the trying to align herself with the majority opinion, because she\u2019s in charge. So, it\u2019s sort of like... she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">always trying to balance the needs of five children and her husband and appears to neglect her own needs (although I don\u2019t think that\u2019 s actually really true; I think it\u2019s... I think it\u2019s sometimes true). But that\u2019s... I say, I only believe that in a zeroth order sense, because I don\u2019t have a mechanism <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201212\">for that transfer from her to us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201cappears,\u201d but you say you don\u2019t think it\u2019s true; so who does it appear to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: The arbitrary objective observer that I made up...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: ...for the purpose of this conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) So, me... to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">THERAPIST: So that dynamic of no one saying, \u201cThis is what I need,\u201d but everybody looking to everyone else, is part of made it stressful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">CLIENT: (pause) I think so, yeah. (therapist responds) Because, so when I come home, I come home least frequently, because I\u2019m farthest away. So everyone wants to see me, but everyone wants to see me at the same time. No one will say, \u201cI want to see you and like, talk with you.\u201d So, everyone just kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201311\">of like, shows up and we\u2019re all there. So... And no one wants to like, step on anyone else\u2019s toes, so no one will say, \u201cI want you to do this with me.\u201d So we kind of like, muddle around until something happens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: (pause) Like, waiting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: Um, yeah, it does feel like waiting. There are certainly like, large periods of time where is just waiting or like, yeah. Or conversation with the sense of waiting for something, if that makes sense. We\u2019re talking, but it\u2019s not... But either it\u2019s not a very deep conversation, or it\u2019s complicated <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201351\">by everyone being there. So, it\u2019s really hard to have a deep conversation with six people at once. (therapist responds) Maybe you don\u2019t find that to be the case. I find it to be the case, that it was hard to have a deep conversation with six people at once. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20134-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20134-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561600\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: Well, if they\u2019re broken into smaller groups, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: And even then, maybe you want privacy, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Do you have a sense of what people are waiting for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">CLIENT: No, no. So that\u2019s, yeah, that\u2019s also stressful. I feel like, that there is some sense in which, you know, I\u2019m there and everyone wants to see me, although that\u2019s not the only thing anyone wants. And so it\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">[pause 00:40:12 to 00:40:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">You know, I actually want to see everyone, and I want to spend some time with each person, and I want to... I want to take care of everyone! That\u2019s part of it. But I don\u2019t have any sense of how to balance that, when there is, I mean, there are just too many possible combinations of \u201cdo this, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201451\">do this, and then do the...\u201d So it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: So what eventually happens?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: Something; (chuckles) I mean... So, fortunately my two sisters both have three-year-olds now, and so they have very clear needs and schedules. So, they come over... when they can, in the three-year-olds schedules. So what ended up happening a lot was like... because they also want to see Tanya, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201491\">and so Tanya is there also, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">[pause 00:41:30 to 00:41:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">So often, one or the other of us would end up playing with one or both of the three-year-olds, depending on how many were there at the time. When they weren\u2019t there, we\u2019d play games with my two brothers (who are in high school and college), who mostly just want to play games and hang out with us. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D1\">it\u2019s sort of easier to meet their needs, in some ways, because I know what they want to do. So it kind of defaults between some of those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Do people look uncomfortable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: No, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: Like, feeling, \u201cUm...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: (pause) No, not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: Uh-hmm. But there are still a stressful element to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah, particularly for me, and I think it\u2019s also stressful for each other person, in their own way. I think there are some shared pieces and some not at all shared pieces. So I\u2019ve sort of been talking about, I sort of drifted from saying there was the shared thing to talking more about the experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201591\">for me (therapist responds), but... You know, I could talk about each of my siblings individually, but that would take a long time. I\u2019m not sure it would be (chuckles) particularly useful. But I don\u2019t know, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Do you think like, your siblings, or your mom, don\u2019t know what they want? Or they just are inhibited from speaking up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: So I have the clearest sense with my oldest sister. So that there was this... Her three-year-old was sick this trip, and so that put a lot of stress on her. Her in-laws were coming in at the same time I was here, but only for a day. It\u2019s always stressful for her when they visit. So, at any rate, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D1\">so, one evening she e-mailed us to tell us that she wasn\u2019t going to come over (she lives about ten minutes away from my parents), and said something less strong than, \u201cYou are welcome to come over here.\u201d So I think she wanted us to come over and visit with her. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2015C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561600\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">(pause) (chuckles) And this just gets very complicated. So anyway, so I was talking with mother later about how stressed Vivianne was. She, (inaudible) inside, said (inaudible), you know, \u201cI think that it would be helpful for her, in general, to vocalize what she wants, both in her marriage and in general.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F1\">I forget why I mentioned \u201cin her marriage\u201d also, but it seemed relevant. (therapist responds) So, I guess, I mean, you know, it\u2019s a very different thing to say, \u201cI want you to come over here,\u201d as opposed to, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome here,\u201d or something less strong. So anyway, so... But I think a day and a half <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F2\">later, she called and said, \u201cWould you come over,\u201d or something like that. So that was nice. She actually asked for what she wanted. So we did go over. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s an example. Well, James (ph), we\u2019re actually going to need to stop for today, I\u2019m realizing. (client affirms) I will see you next week, at our regular time! (client affirms) And the furniture will be the same!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: Okay, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: Okay?
