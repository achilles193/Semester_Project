I feel like in the last couple months, when something would happen, it would make me anxious or something like that. I file that away, talked to Dr. Feldman about that.  I don\u2019t feel like I had many of those moments. I\u2019m not not anxious, but there haven\u2019t been any large events. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve had any freak-outs. Yeah, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Were you with your family over the holidays (crosstalk at 00:03:22)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: When we had the snowstorm, we were briefly with my family, just for a day or two, when we got back from Oregon. We were with Amelia\u2019s family in Oregon for our vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">It was nice, it was the perfect vacation. We had perfect Oregon weather and we did lots of hiking and we were outdoors a lot. Amelia and I spent a lot of time together, it was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">It was a little stressful. Our families are very, very different. They\u2019re like East\/West Coast versions of each other.  My family is the very typical\u2014they\u2019re both very stereotypical in their own ways. My family is very stereotypical Jewish Chicagoans. They know everything that\u2019s going on all the time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200591\">they call me all the time, I call them all the time. When we went home for Thanksgiving to my parents\u2019 house, my mom made an entirely second menu so that I could be able to eat stuff. They just dote on Amelia and I. We never leave there without bags and bags and food, whether or not I have an ulcer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200592\">Everything is always taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">Amelia\u2019s family is the very stereotypical Oregon beach family: super laid-back, a little bit aloof, almost. As much as my parents are in your business to a fault, Amelia\u2019s parents are completely out of it, almost to a fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">Amelia and I talked\u2014I was a little bit stressed before we went out there.  My family, in general, they eat very healthy. My mom\u2019s obsessed with her weight and sees a nutritionist. For me, finding something to eat at my parents\u2019 house is really not a problem, because they basically eat only what Amelia <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D1\">and I eat, anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561610\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">It was always like a vacation when we go to Amelia\u2019s family\u2019s house, because there\u2019s alcohol all the time. They eat well, but not like well in a healthy way. It\u2019s a lot of red meat, a lot of booze, processed foods, fast food. I didn\u2019t really notice it as much before, because we would just eat whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">they ate, because we didn\u2019t have any reason not to before I got sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">I knew, going into this, I was a little bit worried about it. I knew it\u2019s always a lot of drinking and a lot of eating things that I can\u2019t eat. I talked to Amelia about it before we went out. I was like, \u201cLook, this is what I\u2019m concerned about.  It\u2019s kind of making me real stressed, and I don\u2019t like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">traveling anyway. I\u2019m worried because it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">I don\u2019t have any qualms about getting my mom a shopping list, and for me, it all has to be\u2014it\u2019s expensive. Gluten-free, organic, all this stuff is not like the cheap stuff at the grocery store, the stuff that I\u2019ve been eating. Our families are in really different financial situations, as well. I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">feel comfortable giving Amelia\u2019s mom a grocery list of the most expensive items in the supermarket. Even though she asked for it, she was like, \u201cWell, what can Kelsey eat? Can you give me\u2026?\u201d Amelia was like, \u201cLook, if we give her a list, she can have some things in the house.\u201d We were getting in late <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200632\">at night, so I was\u2014I told Amelia, \u201cLook, I\u2019m trying to be polite, here. I don\u2019t really feel comfortable giving your mom all the expensive things in the supermarket to buy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">We agreed that we would just tell her just the basics for when I wake up in the morning: bananas, rice cakes, and peanut butter.  At least I have something to eat before\u2014and then Amelia and I will go to the store ourselves. That seemed like a good plan to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">What ended up happening was that her brother as home, as well. He\u2019s just like my brother, a typical 23-year-old dude; he\u2019ll eat whatever\u2019s in the house, not really paying attention to who got it or what it is. It ended up being that we went to the grocery store every single day. We must have spent a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">couple extra hundred dollars on groceries, because we were unintentionally feeding her family, too. I don\u2019t mind, if they want to eat the stuff that we got that is the only thing I could eat in the house, that\u2019s fine, but maybe give us 20 bucks to go to the store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">We were grocery shopping almost every day. Doing a lot of cooking. I didn\u2019t feel like people were\u2014we cooked dinner a couple nights, and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, this is great! Thanks!\u201d No one really did say, \u201cThank you.\u201d  No one offered to give us some money for the groceries that we were buying that everybody <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">else was eating. There was a couple nights that there ended up being no food for me to eat, because either her dad or her brother had eaten it all during the day. Amelia was getting upset about it, also. I think she was embarrassed. We ended up finally talking about it. I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200692\">but I was really not super-happy and ready to come back home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">We went down to San Diego for Christmas, where her grandparents live. That was another whole big, stressful event, because what am I going to eat Christmas dinner? We find out that, okay, I can actually eat baked ham as long as I take the skin off, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d never eaten ham before; I grew <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">up in a kosher household. It\u2019s kind of funny that that\u2019s the only thing that I was able to eat at Christmas dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561610\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">We decided we would make a couple dishes, as well, to add to it that I could eat.  We spent another $75 getting ingredients for this massive\u2014because I knew, because we had an incident at Amelia\u2019s house where we had to bring\u2014we had ordered sushi and we had to bring one of the rolls back to the restaurant, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">because they put some sauce on it that I couldn\u2019t have. While we were gone, her mom ate the only other thing that I could eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">It\u2019s funny, kind of, how completely aloof they were to what was going on. They didn\u2019t do it in a malicious way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: They had to have known that you were bringing these particular foods for particular reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I have no idea! I must have had\u2014I think it actually concerned Amelia, a little bit, at how out of it her parents seemed to be and how not understanding of my diet they were. I even had a ten-minute conversation with her mom on the porch one morning about what I could and couldn\u2019t eat and why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">I know it\u2019s a lot\u2014there are a lot of restrictions right now, so it\u2019s hard to take in. [0:10:01] I think it\u2019s just\u2014this is just their way of life, that they just don\u2019t really think about these things. The things they were eating, they probably thought their mom had bought from the store, because she <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">usually goes to the store every day or something. I just don\u2019t think they thought to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: She didn\u2019t\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Her mom didn\u2019t\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Exactly. No, I know, I was really\u2014I was aggravated. Amelia was aggravated, as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">Then we get to Christmas and we make this massive, two-pound squash casserole. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cLook, if we only make enough for me to eat, I\u2019m not going to end up getting any because someone else is going to eat it all. Let\u2019s just go for it and we\u2019ll double all the recipes.\u201d We made this massive thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">of squash casserole, I guess whatever you want to call it. Then huge trays of roasted vegetables, like asparagus and Brussels sprouts. People devoured it. There almost wouldn\u2019t have been enough food had we not cooked what we cooked. Nobody even said, \u201cThank you!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">The next day, her mom and her grandma were going back and forth, \u201cOh, thank you for cooking.\u201d  \u201cNo, thank you for cooking!\u201d Amelia was like, \u201cHey, is anyone going to say, \u2018Thanks,\u2019 to Kelsey, because she made half the meal yesterday?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">That was aggravating. Amelia was very\u2026I felt guilty, because she was supportive. She\u2019s been so great throughout this whole thing and just in solidarity the whole week with me. Ate what I was eating and didn\u2019t\u2014her parents brought in\u2014they wanted to take us out to dinner. Of course, they were like, \u201cLet\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">go to this steakhouse.\u201d There\u2019s (inaudible at 00:11:34) places, they were like, \u201cLet\u2019s take you girls out to dinner.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">It was laughable how wrong the menus were for me. There was nothing we could do. They ended up ordering in barbecue or something. I\u2019m sure Amelia would have loved to have some ribs, because she loves red meat, but she had beans with me. I told her she didn\u2019t have to do that, but she was really insistent <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">of sticking with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561610\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Is red meat supposed to exacerbate an ulcer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m not supposed to have red meat. If I could have red meat, it would not\u2014I couldn\u2019t get it from a fast food restaurant with all the sauces and stuff on it. According to my nutritionist, no red meat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">I felt bad, because she was\u2014I didn\u2019t want her to think poorly of her family. I don\u2019t know, I just felt like a big burden the whole time. She kept assuring me that I wasn\u2019t, and it is what it is, and I\u2019m sick right now, and it\u2019s not a problem, but I felt bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">We had this conversation when we got down to San Diego. I finally was like, \u201cLook.

The two of us are shelling out money for groceries, people are not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">really acknowledging it. I was trying to be polite by not giving your mom a grocery list but that apparently was the worst thing that I could have done, because no one else is giving us the same politeness,\u201d or however you describe it, \u201cthat I was awarding to them, no one\u2019s affording us the same manners.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">It was really aggravating. However, on the same token, I think it was\u2014it was the first time that the two of us had the conversation about something that had happened with one or the other\u2019s families that was bothersome to us. I think it made us\u2014it made me feel like at least that we really had created <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">our own separate life here. Both of us talked about how, in the last couple months, the ulcer\u2019s been like\u2014it\u2019s been really shitty, but at the same time, we\u2019ve picked up some really healthy habits from this new diet that I\u2019ve been following that I think will stick with us, because they make us feel good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">We\u2019re not drinking as\u2014well, I\u2019m not drinking at all, but she\u2019s not drinking as much as we used to. We eat really, really well and we like it. She realized, while we were out there, that her parents really\u2014her family\u2019s not healthy at all. I think that it was\u2014both of us were ready to come back home, here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">to this, our home and to our lifestyle and stuff. It was kind of nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Is the idea that you continue on this strict diet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: No. I have an appointment in two weeks, now. The idea is that \u2013 hopefully \u2013 in two weeks, when I go in, because I haven\u2019t really had symptoms for a while, that they\u2019ll tell me I can start going off the medicine. You can\u2019t just go off it, I have to taper it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">Once I am completely off the medicine, see how it goes, still on the diet.  Then I can start\u2014if everything\u2019s good, then I can start adding foods again. That\u2019s the idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: It seems so particular\u2014you can eat ham, but not the skin of the ham.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not going to eat the entire skin of an entire ham.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: That little piece of skin seems\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Who knows? I\u2019m sure I ate a little bit of skin while I was eating. In that regard, eating things has been going kind of well for me, lately. I\u2019ve been adding some things and eating more things that I definitely wouldn\u2019t have even touched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">Oregon is actually the best place to have dietary restrictions, because everywhere, you can get gluten-free everything. It was great. We really got to\u2014it was actually the night before we left or a couple of days before we left, we had this fundraiser and my boss wanted to out for drinks afterwards. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">We ended up going to\u2014I tried to back out at the last minute and invite her to our apartment, so we could cook dinner so I could have something to eat, but Amelia was like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to the pub across the street, because they have turkey burgers and you\u2019re just going to get it plain.  You\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A52\">to eat it because it\u2019s just grilled and it\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561610\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">She made me, which was good, because then I ended up eating\u2014I did. I got what I would have normally gotten, which is the turkey burger, and I just got it without the bun and without the, whatever, the cranberry ketchup. They just gave me some roasted potatoes\u2014they had butter on them and stuff, but on <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">the side instead of French fries. I ate the whole thing and I felt great afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">Then it was great, because when we got to Oregon, it was like I had my restaurant confidence back. We went out to eat a bunch of times and I ordered things that I don\u2019t think I would have ordered a month prior to that. I even had pizza. [On that] (ph), I can\u2019t have tomato sauce, but I had gluten-free <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">pizza without sauce, which was pretty greasy.  It\u2019s gluten-free crust but it wasn\u2019t minus oil or anything and devoured it. I felt good. I\u2019ve been adding things that\u2014gained two pounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Now I feel like I\u2019m finally in\u2014I\u2019ve been weighing myself at the gym, I\u2019m in this range, give or take five pounds. I feel like it\u2019s stable. I\u2019m exercising and feeling good about it. I feel like I\u2019m eating well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: This ulcer exacerbated your preoccupation with food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Which I don\u2019t think was good for you, in the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: No. No, I mean, it\u2019s like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: A phobic response, almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, the same thing happened to me when I was younger. Whatever I was having, it was different than this. Maybe it was gastritis, I don\u2019t know if it was pre-ulcer or ulcerous or something, but I was vomiting every morning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">It was also when I would eat things that\u2014this was when I was kind of transitioning from my binge eating to almost extreme healthy eating, when I was in college. I would vomit the mornings after \u2013 not make myself vomit, but feel like I had the stomach flu or something \u2013 only after I would have really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">big binges the night before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">When they put me on a very restricted diet, back then, and because of the vomiting all the time and the feeling sick, it did create this phobia of certain foods, just because, I don\u2019t know, I likened it to\u2014I kind of remember this one time, I got too drunk in college and I vomited right after I ate a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">whole stick of Rolo\u2019s or something. To this day, I can\u2019t even look at Rolo\u2019s, because you just associate getting sick with certain foods. When you\u2019re sick all the time, you associate it with all of these foods. It\u2019s hard to bring them back in, because you\u2019d rather just not eat than feel sick. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">I\u2019ve been adding things. I ate new things yesterday\u2014I\u2019ve been eating new things almost every day. We\u2019ve added cookies, added carrots. I feel like proud of myself. I now feel like I have enough of a variety that I don\u2019t even feel like it\u2019s limited. I miss having alcohol. I\u2019d really like to be able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">have a glass of wine or some whiskey or something. I even had a couple sips of Amelia\u2019s drinks over the vacation, which was nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561610\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">We\u2019re getting there. I spoke to my doctor before I went to Oregon, because I put a lot of pressure on myself to be healed by the time we went to Oregon. I was really disappointed when I wasn\u2019t. They told me it was going to be another three to four months before I could off this diet. In the grand scheme <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">of things, six months is about the average time it takes for someone to completely heal from an ulcer, and it\u2019s only been three months for me.  I was really upset about it and did talk to my doctor before we went. She was like, \u201cNow, more than ever, the diet is important, because it\u2019s just this last <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C12\">little bit that you need to let yourself heal.\u201d We\u2019ll see what she says on the 16th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a fine line, because it\u2019s good to follow a doctor\u2019s orders, but it can become obsessive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Oh, I totally became\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It reminds me of when you were losing weight and people were saying, \u201cOh, you look great,\u201d it\u2019s sort of like the nutritionist saying, \u201cOh, you\u2019re doing grand, you\u2019re following it to the T.\u201d That\u2019s actually not always that good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I chatted with her a little bit, as well, before we went on vacation, because I was, at that point\u2014because I think it was easy for me to be, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this even more than they\u2019re saying I\u2019m going to do this, because then I\u2019m going to heal faster.\u201d  When that didn\u2019t happen, I kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">of was like, \u201cI can\u2019t. This is not sustainable. I can\u2019t only eat these five things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">I did a chat with her, briefly, as well, before I went to Oregon. I was like, \u201cLook. I really need some variety now. I can\u2019t\u2026I\u2019m really feeling like I\u2019m eating the same thing every day,\u201d which I was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">Then she gave me a list of things, too. I eat trail mix now. I don\u2019t know if I told you that I was drinking the almond milk, finally, but all the things that I kind of\u2014that she had already said was okay but I wasn\u2019t doing. I added all of those, as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">She\u2019s like that. She\u2019s got my mom on almost a liquid diet. Not a liquid diet, she eats real food, two meals a day. She has a shake every morning, and then sometimes she has what she calls two-shake days, which are if she\u2019s feeling like she needs to make up for going out to dinner the night before or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">something.  This woman is a no-nonsense woman, this nutritionist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">It\u2019s funny, because I probably\u2014I know that the medication I was taking is what gave me the ulcer, but had I not\u2014if you were to subtract my anxiety and what my anxiety does to my stomach, maybe it wouldn\u2019t have gotten to that point. Maybe I would have had some inflammation but not an ulcer, or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">like that. It\u2019s not funny but\u2014I don\u2019t think \u201cironic\u201d is the right word, either. I ended up getting this ulcer because I\u2019m so anxious and stressed about everything, but then the ulcer makes me more stressed about everything. Then, of all things to happen to me, the last thing I need is something completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D12\">focusing on food.  It\u2019s just the perfect storm for me to just become completely obsessed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: It fuels my phobia about taking medicine, also, because now I really can\u2019t take a lot of medicine because of my stomach. I was having sinus headaches over the weekend. We had to do 45 minutes of research to find a Sudafed that had acetaminophen in it instead of ibuprofen or instead of naproxen. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">By that point, I don\u2019t want to take anything, because who knows what\u2019s in it? I didn\u2019t take anything.  I took a nap and I felt better.

I would go to a Egyptian pharmacy, where things weren\u2019t even written in English and take whatever they gave me. Then I\u2019d feel better, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">because that\u2019s what medicine does to you when you\u2019re sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">Now, I can\u2019t even take a Sudafed when I have a headache or sinus congestion or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t actually know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: Well, no, Sudafed I can take.

I don\u2019t know, they told me not to take anything with ibuprofen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: After certain procedures, they tell you not to take \u2013 is it Tylenol that thins your blood?

I know it feels inevitable, but it\u2019s inevitable because it\u2019s triggered by a series of thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Where my anxiety kind of fluctuates between Amelia\u2019s safety, my safety, my health, that\u2019s kind of\u2014I share the love with all sorts of things in my life.

I have never actually looked through their website too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">They did a miniseries on anxiety. Their editor, I guess, suffers intensely from anxiety, since he was a kid. He wrote this really long piece. I really liked it. It was funny and just about all of his anxieties and his phobias and the stomach issues they give him. He told some crazy stories about pooping <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201131\">his pants in the Kennedy house (inaudible at 00:28:50) doing an investigative report story\u2014I don\u2019t know, just things that\u2014he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, hey, that doesn\u2019t always happen to me.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">Wait a minute, what was I\u2026?

After the piece that he wrote, they kind of opened it up and invited readers to share their own experiences with anxiety. Of course, I was reading everybody\u2019s, which probably\u2014I was fine while I was reading his thing, but then when I was reading <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">everybody else\u2019s, I started to be like, \u201cWell, maybe I should be checking my pulse every 30 seconds.\u201d I stopped reading those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">Amelia and I were chatting about it, and I was telling her that it seems that it\u2019s pretty\u2014he was writing about how it can be\u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s officially really common that this happens or just he knows of a lot of people who seem very put together and calm and laid back on the outside and give off <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">that impression, but the other people don\u2019t\u2014you would not necessarily know how much someone\u2019s suffering from anxiety or a phobia or something all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">I was telling Amelia, I was like, \u201cYou know, it was interesting to see that that is a common thing.\u201d I feel like people tell me, when I do get close enough to someone and let them know about my issues with anxiety, I\u2019m always met with surprise. When I went back to school for a presentation in the fall <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">and I ran into a professor who I\u2019m close with and we were chatting about my stomach.

You were like the least stressed person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">Of course, I know that that\u2019s completely far from the truth. Amelia was like, \u201cReally? I can\u2019t believe people would think that you\u2019re calm or laid back.\u201d That made me kind of upset, because when we first dating and when she got to know me and when she fell in love with me, I wasn\u2019t like this. Now, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D1\">upsetting that this has become such a part of my personality that she doesn\u2019t even remember. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2011C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561610\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">I was like, \u201cWell, don\u2019t you remember before we\u2014when we were in Egypt, this wasn\u2019t such a thing?\u201d She was like, \u201cReally?

One can\u2019t control anxiety. That doesn\u2019t happen. That doesn\u2019t work that way. People can develop techniques to calm themselves down in the moment, but the ongoing, underlying anxiety, it\u2019s such a sort of wired <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F1\">state.

No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: No. Not really. Not in my experience. I work with a lot of people who go on medication. I\u2019m not a pill pusher.

First of all, because if it doesn\u2019t help you\u2014if it works, great.  If it doesn\u2019t work, you just stop taking it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: Your losses, in a very practical sense, are nil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: How soon do you know whether it\u2019s working or not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Depends on what you\u2019re prescribed. There are certain medications that help alleviate anxiety in the moment, those are pretty obvious pretty quick. There are the medications that take a couple weeks to build up into your bloodstream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">I\u2019ve seen some people\u2014they don\u2019t get much of a reaction.

Have you ever said, \u201cStop obsessing and don\u2019t think about food anymore\u201d?  How does that work?

I\u2019ve never even given it thought. I feel like I channel my mother. When I was younger \u2013 I think it was in high school, maybe middle school \u2013 and they took me to\u2014I don\u2019t know if she was a psychiatrist. I think she might have been a psychiatrist, child psychiatrist or something, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F1\">I wasn\u2019t doing well in school \u2013 as well as my mother thought that I could do.

Yeah, I\u2019m a little bit like\u2014I\u2019m a high-energy person. I wasn\u2019t being stimulated in the ways that I needed to be stimulated when I was in middle school and high school. I wasn\u2019t enjoying what I was doing in school, so I wasn\u2019t motivated to do any more than the bare <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201611\">minimum.

I think I should talk to my brother, because I think that he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A91\">on medication. I know he\u2019s on medication, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s for anxiety.
