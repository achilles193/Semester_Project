[ ] (inaudible at 00:00:21) and they'll give you a new one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I'm going to go down there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah, you should do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. Always. Apple extends your warranty for three years. Inside that warranty they'll fix anything as long as you're not being a douche. You can't throw it at the wall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Can't make any promises.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Do what you can. Just do what you can.  The answer to the question \"how did I sleep?\" is \"like a baby\" for about four hours and then I woke up. That's nice. It's not my fault though. I had gotten home from a board game night with some friends and checked online and my buddies Charles and Rich <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">were like, \"Yeah. We're playing Neverwinter,\" which is a new free-to-play. You download it for free and log in for free and play it for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What's it called?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Neverwinter. It's based on the Neverwinter Nights IP Dungeons and Dragons universe. I'm like a wizard running around after fire and ice and things. So we played that for a few hours and I was like, \"I need to be up in five hours. I'd better get on that.\" This morning with the alarm going off <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">for some reason it switched from buzzer to the radio. I freaked out when I woke up. \"What's that soft mumbling? Oh, crap. Time to get up.\" It had been 16 minutes that I'd been sleeping and it was on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh with the sound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. Crap. I took the dogs out and brought them back in. Pepper (sp?) did not want to stay in the crate. Then I bent down to give her the treat and she's already scooted past me and she's up and over the bed. She's lying on the bed and I'm like, \"No. This is not going to work.\" She falls over <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">on her back and is like, \"Arrrrgh.\" I move her and she flips around and she's on her back \"Arrrgh.\" She nips at me. No. I'm not having this. Maybe she needs to go outside again. Maybe that's what she needs. So she runs downstairs and jumps up on the back of the couch in the sunbeam. She's like done. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">This is what I'm doing. I'm like, \"No. You can't do that. We're going upstairs.\" \"Arrrgh.\" So I pick her up and put her in the crate. She looks at me like, \"Fuck you.\" \"Fuck you, too, bitch.\" I close the door and give her a treat, of course.  Hank is like, \"I get it. You give me a treat if I go in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">crate. That's the deal. How would we deviate? I don't even know.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: He goes along with the plan. He's on board.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: He's picked up that Ginny lies about it most of the time, so he actually makes her show him the treat before he'll get in the crate. He just looks at her. She gets the treat. Now he's even watching her hand to make sure she's actually going to give it to him. (chuckles) But he still falls for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">it. This is a box of treats. \"Hank, this is a box of treats.\" \"Oh, fuck. A whole box of treats.\" He gets in there and you close the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: If you run out of treats he'll fight you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: If you're out of treats you can be like, \"Hank, you want this?\" That's literally all you need to do. And he'll be like \"Oh, cool. Well, of course I do want that.\" Great. Whatever. \"Refrigerator.\" He comes running. He's dumb. He's a dumb dog. He's a good boy. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: He's a good boy, yeah. Pepper will do what she wants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: She's ten years old so she's like, \"I'm [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:13) dog.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I just want to be out of my cage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. I would leave her out of the cage except as soon as I go out the front door she will howl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. She'll just howl. And then Hank, he's upstairs and he's like, \"Pepper's howling. I'd better get in on this.\" He's a beagle well, he's half beagle so he can really, really travel with that. If you put them both in their crates and leave they're like, \"Okay. I guess I'm in charge of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">this space and that's all I'm going to worry about.\" It's like, \"I'm in charge of the entire house? Aw, fuck. Bigger dogs. Bigger dogs. Quick. Come here, bigger dogs.\" That's what barking is, apparently. It's like, \"Get bigger dogs. Come here. We need bigger dogs.\" Even bigger dogs [ ] (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">00:04:59), assuming there is a bigger dog. It's interesting. We don't always assume that there's someone bigger than us. Dogs just assume so. [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:15) There must be something bigger than us. Why? Why must that be true? There's something bigger than everything. What's bigger than us <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200373\">is the entire planet. It freaks me out to think about the fact that we are just actually part of this planet, literally just a piece of it all in the same chemical world. It's all part of it, you know? Part of us came from stars and that's because the earth was made of stars first and you're made from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200374\">those chemicals. It's just one organism, just one giant organism, the entire thing all made of the same stuff, the same stars. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I differentiated. It can be a little bit undifferentiated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, when you look at it that way. A 19-year-old kid built a nuclear fission reactor in his garage when he was 14 years old. [His dad] (ph?) works on fission reactors, small ones, modular ones. With timing he can bury them under the ground and they could produce 2,000 megawatts for 30 years. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">The way he describes it is it's enough to power 27,000 homes and it's much safer to proliferate because you bury it under the fucking ground. Thirty years of power before you have to refuel it. We can put it anywhere in the world. We can put it anywhere. He says we can put it on spaceships and we can <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">watch it cold and turn it on in space. Now you can propel yourself. They have 50 times more power than our current spaceships get. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Current spaceships get like one to two megawatts and, apparently, that's a huge deal as he describes it in his tech talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: How old is he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Nineteen. He started his own company right out of high school for doing nuclear fission technology and working on spaceships and these nuclear fission reactors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh, my God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. How about that, indeed? You can sit and watch this thing in space in a rocket ship and use it to propel the spaceship to Mars. Once you get to Mars you take it out of the spaceship and it will power your Martian community. That's great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know people are going to Mars, right? You know about the mission? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I didn't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It starts this year. They're going to fund it by documenting it and then running ads for it, but this year you apply. You're like, \"I want to fucking go to Mars.\" You train for ten years and then they send you to Mars in waves and it's a one-way trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: And then you go in these spaceships. You land and you set them up and this is the habitat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What did it sound like to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: It sounds amazing. I would never fucking go but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: You wouldn't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: No. Fuck no. No. It's a long way. I hate going places I cannot leave, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Something about that a one-way ticket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. You go. It's like we're going to the new world. Good-bye. It's a six-month journey with a boat. You'll probably never make it back. If I was around for the second return boat, who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: But you're not coming back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: You're not coming back. It's literally a new world now.  Someday, of course, you'll look back at that with laughter because space will be like, \"Yeah, yeah. We went to the new world.\" Really? [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:08) universe is that's what was actually important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but it must be similar to that, going to some far, far away . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. Now the difference is that they'll be able to communicate with us wirelessly and with the radio technology. We'll be able to talk and have discussions like, \"Hey, how is Mars going?\" \"Oh, you know. Not bad. It's Mars. It's red.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: How far is the trip?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I have no idea. But I still wouldn't do it, especially on a spaceship with a [nuclear fission rack there.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: This guy's reactor is going to be part of this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's the build. That's what he wants to do. Is it going to be part of this program? Probably.  It hasn't been discussed, but it's there. He'll do it. Yeah, you train for ten years and then you go and start a Martian colony. This is a private company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And it's going to be funded through advertising?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. They're going to have a TV show about the training program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: They should have a TV show about their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. We could all watch it. We all watched some dude step around the moon, right? Think of what we'd do if it was, \"Hi. I'm living on the planet Mars. Super boring. (laughs) But here we are.\" Stranger in a Strange Land begins that way. Send a team of six or eight to Mars and they all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">go through intense personality screenings, psychological screenings to make sure that they'd be a compatible eight-person group because once they get to Mars who knows how long before they can get back.  But they don't kill each other. What happens is they get to Mars and . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: They all destroy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: There's infidelity in one of the couples. One of the women sleeps with one of the other men and becomes pregnant and then jealousy erupts and fighting and they can't survive. The baby is saved by the Martians that live there and they raise the baby and the baby gets sent back to earth. That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">Kevin as a stranger in a strange land. And, of course, he has all these different ways of looking at things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: What did you say? It's Kevin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Kevin is the name of the guy, the character. (pause)  It's a good book, Stranger in a Strange Land.

What you've seen in the movie is a fucking travesty. If you've read the book, it's quite good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: The book is good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: The book is quite good, yes. The movie is not even the same. But there that is. Speaking of movies, Ironman III tonight; that's where I'll be at 9:30. And then tomorrow at 4:30 there's another viewing. I'll probably go see that. And then Saturday Ginny would like to see it so we'll go see a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">matinee, so I'm thinking three times will be the right number for this one.  Speaking of that, Ironman, I may have been through this before, but the difference between Ironman and all the superheroes is when you grow up you don't want to be Ironman; you want to be Tony Stark. That's actually the difference. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">That's what I wanted, to become Tony Stark because he's actually the core driving the machine. I don't mean just the machine; he builds the machine. He's the one who can build the machine. And, of course, he's that billionaire playboy architect. Everybody wants to be a billionaire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah, be the smartest guy in the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, the smartest guy in the room. Yeah, fucking little Tony Stark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Now I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:55) Tony Stark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Do you have a sense of Tony Stark being independent of Downy? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. I've read all the Ironman issues 1-300.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Is that right? Like the original?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. Issue number one. Back when Ironman and Captain America shared the same comic book, the first half was Captain America and the second half was Ironman; and the second half was never as good as the second. Captain America was fine; he was totally fine. I've also ready 1-300 of him. Technically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">the actual Captain America starts at 101, whereas Tony Stark had to start over so, technically, it's 1-200, so they both share a comic book until issue 100 and then Captain America got his own. It was 101 and then Ironman got his own as number one. My stepfather collected them for the same number of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">years, so I read them all.  They're excellent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it is different. I can't imagine people emulating Ironman. You emulate Tony Stark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, Ironman is just a machine that Tony Stark drives around. [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:31) Tony Stark as well. There was this whole series of the [ ] wars in the '80s before the dark age of comics, which was the '90s which some of the worst comics ever created were created in the 1990s because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">they realized that comics have value so they started trying to make comics that would be valuable and they just devalued everything. [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:56) Tony Stark was in a series called the [Honor Wars] (ph?).  This was in 1980 when Tony Stark was [ ]. Awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well he's kind of the man with [the talent, I guess.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. He discovers that his technology has been stolen and that people are incorporating it into other suits and all these other villains have bits of his technology in a suit that's powering them and he's like, \"Well, crap. This is my technology and it's really powerful. It's my responsibility <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">to make sure that only I have it.\" So he starts going around destroying people's suits of armor, fusing the circuits and slagging the entire thing. \"You don't have your armor anymore. I'm not going to let you have this.\" All of the various super-armored supervillains. But at the same time he's also <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F2\">leaking a bunch of his technology to the government and they use it in their warden for the superhero jail, so he's like, \"I can't let them have it either. It's not safe.\"  But they have it and now it's out there, so literally they can't protect it, so he attacks the superhero [business] (ph?) taking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F3\">out all the suits of armor that they have. The Avengers team is like, \"What the fuck, dude? These are good guys.\" He's like, \"Yeah, but I'm doing this thing. There's a problem and I'm fixing it.\" They're like, \"We can't let you do that. You're a bad guy now.\" But, of course, Tony Stark has always been <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F4\">this guy. People are like, \"You're an asshole.\" He's like, \"I'm doing the right thing. I'm doing the correct thing. If you don't like it that's too bad. I'm doing it. I'm fucking Tony Stark. What are you going to do if the [ ] follows through?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: He stays the same. The lines of right and wrong change around him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. They really do.  He starts the superhero civil war, as well, and a lot of people get hurt and some people die. And then after the whole thing, he's dying. He's like, \"Yeah. I need something to bring my body back to life. I've downloaded my brain and made a backup of it, but it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">about six months out of date, though, so it's going to be tricky.\" So they bring him back. He doesn't remember any of the civil wars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, except that he's dying. He starts reading up on newspapers of what happened and all these other things and all this damage he's caused to all these people. Everyone is like, \"Yeah, we understand that you haven't done those things. You're Tony before all that.\" He's like, \"No, I would have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">done exactly the same thing. I know that when I did those things I believed I was making the right choice, so I don't apologize for any of that.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: They kind of don't hold him responsible it, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, they want to let him off the hook, like you're not the Tony Stark who did those things. You're six-months before that. He's like, \"No, I'm still that Tony Stark. Those are choices I would have made because I believe those were the right choices.\"  It's almost like you're an asshole, Tony <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">Stark. Yeah, Tony Stark taught me the meaning of [pragmatism]. (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: To always make the correct choice regardless of the other factors. Let's not get tied up in right and wrong, just what is the correct choice? That's what he did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I see. Right. Those things are kind of threats to your integrity of yourself. If you can get off the hook you're kind of betraying yourself, in some way. He'd betray himself if he said, \"Yeah, I didn't do that stuff. That's not me.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: He's like, \"No, that is me. That's exactly what I would have done.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Ironman is such an interesting metaphor, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: It's true. It's flawed. He was an alcoholic for a long time and had to fight that, a little demon-in-a-bottle series, as he fights the alcoholism in the '70s. That's when Marvel did a big push against drugs. Spiderman had a whole thing where drugs where bad and you shouldn't do drugs. Ironman <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">had a little alcoholism, like \"alcohol can be dangerous.\" Ironman taught me to be careful with alcohol. (laughs) It helped. That's what I learned from Tony Stark.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Someone I could take [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:30). I read that being a very important concept I think as early as I was nine, I think, I remember actually putting that into those words; such as there was this guy who ran Webelos. Do you know Webelos?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It sounds familiar. What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: It's the step between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: It stands for \"we be loyal scouts.\" You can earn a medal, a little badge called the Arrow of Light in Webelos, if you ace Webelos. It lets you skip the first rank of Boy Scout. I did it.  I fucking nailed it the only one in my whole church troops to get the Arrow of Light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because I wanted it. Also when I got to Boy Scouts, I was like, \"I don't want any of this. This is dumb. I don't like this.\" The guys who ran it weren't the guys from Webelos. He was just in town to run Webelos and then he moved away afterwards. I really liked talking to him. He took me <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">out to a movie once. My mom was like, \"Would you please take him out to a movie? He respects you so much for your leadership.\" And we talked about him leaving. He was like, \"Yeah, I like you, but I also have to go. I have another thing I have to do.\" And I remember being like okay, I need to take bits <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB2\">of him that I like and do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: What did you take?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: I don't even recall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: There's something you've taken from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Something. Something. Probably the nurturing aspect. That might even be where mentoring started; my ability to be there and be an example for the people might have come from that. Yeah. I took so many things from so many people over the years, it's hard to remember necessarily where that came <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">from, you know? I took the honor code directly from the academy and from [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:40), the headmaster of the academy [ ].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You took that, kind of to heart?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, because the academy ran on an honor code. There were no bells; there were no locks on the lockers.

You know when you get to class, it's a class. You get out of one class; you have three minutes to go to the next one. Be on time.  It's not hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: We don't need bells.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: We don't need bells. We don't need locks. Just go in your locker. Don't go in other people's lockers. Simple. This is your cubby. We're passing out various assignments and keeping snacks in there or whatever. Don't take stuff that's not yours. Simple. This is the library. We had free periods. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">I don't know if high schools have those, but it's like you don't have a class right now. You're a junior or a senior. Now you have a free period. What do you want to do? I don't know. Just don't leave the school grounds. Just don't do it. Simple. Simple stuff. Don't cheat on tests. Don't do it. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">had an honor council. We had three. We had steering council, sports council and honor council. I was in the steering council the first couple of years. It was fucking boring as hell.  It's like how do we spend the entertainment fund? What kind of dances should we have? I got to be on the honor council <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF3\">the last year and that was interesting. The honor council had to represent every class level, five future levels. When someone broke the rules they went before the honor council and we would hear what happened and we'd listen and we'd determine what the appropriate punishment should be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: It's student determined? Council determined?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. There was a faculty advisor and when it came down to when the kids were selling acid on school property, that didn't go to us. That was just no, you guys are out. You're gone. But when it came to stuff like that, like okay, you guys were all caught drinking on the ski trip, so now what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">would we do? They were all in trouble and then it would also go to us for the civil suit, pretty much. What do you owe us now? Because of you we don't have a ski trip anymore. It just doesn't happen. That's too bad. I first gave a woman an orgasm on our ski trip. It was a great time. There was a boy's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E32\">section and a girl's section. One was supposed to be between them. [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:20) once you follow all the rules you can break the rules whenever you want to because they're not looking for you. I was like no, Fred always follows the rules. It was one of those times when I was like there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E33\">was a woman over there and she wants me to make out with her so I have to do this. That's what I did. I felt amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: You did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because I had been reading all these books, Changing Bodies, Changing Lives, this big, fucking tome of puberty. What's happened to you and to women? I'd been reading this and studying this and be like how do women masturbate?  What are the mechanics involved and how does this work? How <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">would I find the clitoris just by touch? How would I do this. And when it came time, I just knew. I just knew how to do it. I was like, \"This is the geography. Ahh, okay. If I'm here, then this there we go.\" I never had a hard time finding the man with the boat, as they say. I've never been [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E72\">at 00:27:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You felt what did you say? Amazing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, amazing. I was incredible. I had this ability, this thing I could do that she said other people couldn't do to her. I tell you, her outlook changed after that. It had been very like, \"Oh, we should kiss. You can touch my boobs.\" But as soon as I made her come, that was it.  It was different. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">She was like, \"We should be totally having sex now.\" Not that we ever did have sex, because that would have been stupid. I must have told you this. We were hanging out naked. I was a junior in high school. She was over and we had the house to ourselves for the day and we were in my room naked and were <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB2\">doing sex stuff to each other. I've got a drawer full of condoms so I put on a condom so we could have sex and be relatively safe. She was on the pill at that time (snickers), even in high school. We're rolling around and I'm above her and she's totally naked and I'm naked. I'm like, \"I kind of want <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB3\">to have sex with you.\" She looks in my eyes so intently, so serious she becomes, and she says, \"Make love to me.\" At that moment I was like, \"Nope. Nope.\" Because I realized and I understood that this is huge.  This is a huge step. There's a lot of responsibility in this step. I was like, \"Nope. I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB4\">done. Never mind.\" Let's just jerk off with each other instead. It's like, \"We've been doing masturbation. Let's stick with that. That seems safe.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Keep the intensity down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, down. And a year later she was pregnant. A year later she was pregnant. She called me on my 18th birthday to let me know she was sleeping with this other guy named Harry. Yeah, she got pregnant right afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Was it out of spite or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: I don't know, but she moved in with him, with his family because she had a hard home life and she kept trying to kill herself and she was anorexic. I remember when I broke up with her the last time she tried to kill herself and she went to the hospital again. It was like her third attempt to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">kill herself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: No wonder you must have known something about her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Probably right. So she was in the hospital and I called her at the hospital and said, \"I'm upset. Is this my fault?\" and she said, \"Yes.\" And again at that exact moment I'm like, \"Ahh. No. This is not my responsibility.\" I was like, \"No. You tried to kill yourself. That's actually not on me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">I can't take the blame for this. I won't be assigned the blame for this, just like I won't take responsibility for having sex with you because that's a stupid idea, so let's not do it.\" I won't let myself feel that you tried to kill yourself because of my actions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: No, you had some sense that if you did that you might have felt more responsible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Oh, I would have responsibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: You would have? What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: Once done it can never be undone, right? You can always kind of walk away. If I get you pregnant I can't walk away. The consequences are bigger than you. [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:23) walk away from that unless there's DNA, for instance, being able to prove very easily who the father is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: Were you feeling kind of that having sex with her was kind of equal to impregnating her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Not necessarily, but there was a possibility. Yeah. I just weighed it and all the possibility scenarios and ways it could go wrong flashed in my head and I was like, \"No. This is it.\" My uncle was so grumpy about the whole thing because he made sure I had condoms. I was living with my uncle <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201031\">the entire year.  He made sure I had condoms and made sure I had the various books on sex. I had The Joy of Sex. I had The Sensual Man. I had a lot of porn. He got me a subscription to Playboy and everything. He made sure that I had access to that sort of stuff, which was really useful. All of it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201032\">really useful. So when I got to college although I hadn't actually serious sexual relationships, I was good at what I was doing because I had done research. I had looked at the mechanics of it. I knew how everything worked. I was a quick study, too. A quick study. Every woman was different. Every human <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201033\">is different. Every lover is different. They all need to be manipulated in their own way, so it's a matter of learning that. But knowing the language, knowing the mechanics made it very easy to do that and very quickly.  So I was popular for those reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: Did you feel that kind of exhilaration, the feeling of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's power, isn't it?

I think in seven years, six <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">years actually, being in college there, not counting the summer that I was gone, there were only six months where I had to sleep alone, where I didn't have the option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: The total?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, where I didn't have the option of sleeping with somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: Sleeping alone what about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Well, I was always in some relationship with someone.

In the course of the night I roll all over the place until all the blankets are around me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you're trying to just establish space, your own cocoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So now I sleep in the big bed and she sleeps in her bed, which is full sized. I sleep in a queen size. Her bed is a [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:12) bed. It's an Amish bed antique. She sleeps in her room and I sleep in the bedroom. I've got my own office. She has her bedroom; it's her office. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F1\">We have our own space and it works out really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: And when she's gone, you'll know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, when she's not home or she's gone for the evening like on the weekend, I sleep on the couch downstairs with the stairway light on. It sort of casts some light. So I sleep with a nightlight, essentially, when she's gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it brings up some fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I sleep on the bottom floor near the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: Is it to leave or is it to protect the place? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: It's both. There is the [fierce logic that I don't need to be] (ph?) anxious to get out of the house, regardless of who else is in their house. It's sad, but if someone was to have your child with a knife to their throat and said, \"Stop or I'll kill your child.\" Well they were going to kill <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B1\">your child, so either they're going to do it slowly while you watched or they're going to do it quickly while you're out of the house going to get the cops. They were going to kill your child anyway. When somebody breaks into your house when you're there, the only reason is to kill you slowly. That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B2\">the only reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you want to just get the hell out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah, you just get out. You just get out. Yeah. Don't track through the house after intruders yourself with a gun because when the cops come they will use five police officers with body armor working in concert to clear your house of one shooter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yeah. The thing, too, is it sounds like just Ginny's presence is almost a psychological protection in a way. You feel like you're not invaded by all that terror and all that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: She'll hear it if someone comes to the house, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: She'd hear it before you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: She's a very light sleeper.

When she's not there it's nice that this is the house now. This is mine. I kind of move into the living room for the most part. I order pizza and rent movies, hang out on the couch, stretch out into the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Be a dude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah, be a dude. I revert. I go feral almost immediately. A wild boar. A pig is a wild boar. There's a difference between pigs and wild boars. Pigs are domesticated and wild boar are wild.  This is the interesting thing I learned on the Discovery Channel. If you release a pig into the wild, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F1\">it becomes a wild boar. It grows hair; it grows tusks; its DNA activates. It's like literally there are genes you weren't using. Let's turn those on and it grows tusks and it grows hair. It becomes a wild boar. Two different animals, essentially. A pig becomes that. We don't do that. Ancient DNA doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F2\">awaken in us if you put us in the woods. We just die. We don't become a creature that can survive in the woods. We just become another [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:48) in the woods. People who have training can do it, but like dogs. Dogs don't do that. They don't even become a dog that can survive in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F3\">wild. They just become a stupid dog.  [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:01) that they can't possibly understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: Once you're domesticated, you lose it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: Close. That's why I look at these prostitutes and I'm like \"no.\" I keep having these dreams where I have this really close relationship with a woman. It's always different. One was a zombie apocalypse. There was a post-zombie apocalypse trying to find a place to live and there was this gated <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201431\">community and a there were a bunch of people in the group that were like, \"Oh, great. We can move in with those people in the gated community.\" I'm like, \"That's a good zombie snack-fest right there just waiting to happen. That's not safe. There are a bunch of people in one location.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">THERAPIST: Oh, because they'd want to eat everybody there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. There's this woman that I was with. We held hands [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:52) we spoke to each other. [ ]  They've been pretty frequent lately, these dreams of this close physical contact with a woman. And she's always someone really important to me. She's always some long-term relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">THERAPIST: What about her? Is there anything about her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's a different woman each time, but it's the same sort of closeness. There's this importance in her touch, you know? The most recent one I was trying to figure out how I was going to tell Ginny. I was like, \"This is something I need to do. I love you and you're my wife, but she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B1\">a part of my life now. This girl is a part of my life.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559985\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">THERAPIST: In the dream you're thinking that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I don't want you to be mad or upset, but she's part of the deal now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">THERAPIST: It's got somewhat of a parallel to the chat room, the woman what was her name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">CLIENT: Helen. Helen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">THERAPIST: Helen, yeah. There was something really important about the sexual, but it wasn't purely sexual, clearly. It was something that was going on there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah, there was some kind of connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">THERAPIST: And something that you find is missing with Ginny in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah, we talked about that. I'm not [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:36) it seems like there is always some reason that we don't have sex that often. There's always some reason. She's like, \"But how will you know that you're desired and I want you?\" I'm like, \"Well, you could act on those things.\" She's <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B1\">like, \"So what about right now when I physically can't because of this yeast infection?\" I'm like, \"Well, did you ever go to the doctor?\" She's like, \"No.\" I'm like you need to get on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">THERAPIST: She still hasn't gone? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">CLIENT: She has one lined up now. Her friend, Darcy, has this doctor and she's really good, but that should be for her. If what you're saying is true and you really mean it and you're not just saying it because you want me to hear it, then you should do that. I was thinking to myself that if I had enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F1\">money I would really consider paying for sex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">THERAPIST: You're not getting any sex?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20163\">CLIENT: No. I mean there's some but still . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20165\">THERAPIST: How much has it been lately for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20167\">CLIENT: If it's four times a month, that's a good month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20169\">THERAPIST: And what has that been like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B\">CLIENT: How has it been? It starts out fine and then it kind of feels so one-sided I feel like a pervert. I'm like, \"No, it's just me, huh?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D\">THERAPIST: You're not seeing her there in it, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not connecting.

She seemed invested in it. She seemed to understand. And the idea of Anat, the love priestesses of Anat, back before the oldest god on record was Anat, the love goddess.  Love and sex. The very oldest god we have on record. This is before Judaism. Judaism <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201871\">fucked everything up. Honestly, Judaism fucked everything up. Judaism [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:18) worship and love their gods.

Anat was the mother of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is the oldest book we have on record. Gilgamesh was one of the few people who survived after the flood, who traversed the flood. Gilgamesh who raises up Enkidu and can't save him. He does <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2018F1\">everything he can but cannot save him.

Gilgamesh is a child of Anat. He is divine, actually. He is kind of a mortal divine. He a divine mortal half-breed and he's a fucking hero. Gilgamesh kicked ass. He meets this beast man named Enkidu who lives in that house. He gets in there and they wrestle and they fight <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201931\">and everything and they become best friends. It's a very interesting mix between this man who is divine and this man who is a beast. They learn [ ] (inaudible at 00:46:49) and Enkidu becomes more like the [ ]. Enkidu is killed somehow and Gilgamesh has to travel across this river to go get this lotus <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201932\">because if he can bring the lotus back then he can bring Enkidu back to life; but there is some trick to it.  It turns out he was tricked. It turns out the lotus won't actually do it and he fails. He fails to bring Enkidu back to life and so the lesson is that people die. It's like Gilgamesh doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201933\">die, but people die. No matter what he wants to do he can't change the fact that people die. (pause) He can't fix it. As powerful as he is, he can't fix that. It's a real interesting story.
