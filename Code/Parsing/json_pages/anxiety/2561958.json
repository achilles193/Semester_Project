Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: And does that mean that any other time is free that you\u2019d want to try to maneuver, or what? What do you \u2013 yeah, what are your thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean. Out of class at 10:50. Conceivably, if there is something outside of that period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Maybe, even then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve got to be back at school \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve got to be back at school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: And what time\u2019s your class?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I get out of class at 10:50 and I have to be back for 2:15.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I think it just might be a little tight to be honest with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. That would mean you\u2019d come back here for \u2013 and then go \u2013 yeah, okay. I think the earliest I could probably due would be 1:15 which probably would be too tight for you to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. There\u2019s not much I can do other than \u2013 so maybe we\u2019ll just say for the time being that unless something else happens (unclear). Actually that\u2019s the thing. So that week is also Martin Luther King Day and also means I will be quite free on Wednesday, alternatively. That\u2019s when I would have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">the class. So I\u2019ll be out of class on Wednesday at like 1 \u2013 from 2 o\u2019clock, I\u2019ll be out of class for the rest of that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Okay. I might know more \u2013 I\u2019ll know more next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just wanted to get that under your radar as soon as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there might be a way I can do it. So it would be the 22nd?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Okay, there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll have a 3 o\u2019clock free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, that would probably work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Or even 3:15.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay. (Cross talk). Oh man. Had my first classes this week. Started on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m back. I\u2019m back in school. This break was really nice. It was sad to see break end. (Unclear) all the time, which was really nice. It just sort of happened that her schedule \u2013 saw her not working a whole bunch of days in a week so I wasn\u2019t even expecting it. We ended up having like a nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">little week together which was a lot of fun. And then snow days and stuff cancelled her work. So by the time class started in was definitely in vacation mode. But it was good. I started off \u2013 my classes, I have a bunch of new professors. I have two classes added to my schedule this semester. Which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">good because those are like the two only real classes of the year which I\u2019m like genuinely interested in in terms of the subject matter. So that\u2019s good. It\u2019s been fun. But yeah, right back into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right back into it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: I\u2019m already feeling extended thin and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: What did you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Just like I already feel like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Extended thin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, like stretched thin, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I thought you said \u201cextended fin\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Oh right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Sort of a nick name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: No. Just \u2013 that\u2019s funny. No I just already feel like it\u2019s going to be super, super, super busy and I already feel a little distracted in terms of \u2013 just in going from being able to spend so much time with Laney and talking with her so much and stuff to having to re-shift my focus. It\u2019s just a little frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: But it is what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561958\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Like kind of like student mode. I think the way you depicted it is kind of like a very stark contrast to what it might be outside of school, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just kind of feel like in a way it makes it \u2013 you know I want to be in school and I want to be a student and I want to do this and I don\u2019t have any regrets about doing it but in some way makes it hard. I feel like it\u2019s very difficult if not ultimately impossible for me to do a really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">good job of being a student, but also being the type of person that I want to be you know, in terms of my relationship with Laney or something, you know? I just feel like those two things are constantly pulling at me from different directions and giving to one is taking away the other or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I could talk about that for a long time. So I just feel like coming from the period where I was able to just spend lots of time at home and everything, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really only with Laney, though. It really doesn\u2019t play out in any other aspect, any of the relationships I have right now. Even in just little things, you know, like just really busy and really rushed and I wouldn\u2019t clean up the kitchen before I go to bed. And I feel bad because then Laney <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">has a messy kitchen to wake up to or \u2013 you know, these are all things that I did a lot of when I was on break. Keeping the house really clean. You know, there\u2019s a way to try to make it more pleasant for her when she came home and saw it. I feel like my kind of hectic-ness is kind of spilling over into her life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it impacts her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how it impacts. I know the ways I think about it might be impacting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a better way of putting it. [0:08:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: So there\u2019s that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: But other than that, it\u2019s right back into school. This will be a busier semester than last semester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You added to your classes. Do you lose any?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: So it will be like one extra class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: One extra class. But how many is it? Is it four then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Five or six.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh wow, five or six, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: And one of them is well I\u2019ve just not ever had assigned so much nightly. I never had a class where I had to spend as much time preparing for class. So that\u2019s effectively like two classes in a sense, I mean the time I spend on it. A really difficult professor. Everyone\u2019s very scared of him. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">it\u2019ll work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: But why? What does he do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: He \u2013 like did you like the Socratic Method cold calling? He\u2019s considered to be a bit more kind of aggressive and abrasive with his questioning in terms of if people seem unprepared or like they\u2019re not getting something right. People have the impression of him being like a blow hard, aggressive <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">with his questioning. Some people I think that have a hard time speaking in public find it extremely scary and stuff. You know, like the way my professors have been? He reads, he reads stuff like this and people feel like he\u2019s a pretty terrifying person. He\u2019s very demanding and whatnot. Which is good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B2\">and I\u2019m glad that I have that type of workload and a class I\u2019m interested in. It\u2019s just a lot of work. So in general this semester is going to be a lot of work \u2013 a lot more work than last semester. But I think it will be fine. I got the last paper that we did in writing. We got that paper back in our <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B3\">first class of this semester on Wednesday and I got an A on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561958\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Which was really nice to see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. I got an A minus on the last one. So this one actually I did a little bit better on. Which was very reassuring in a sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Although I can\u2019t really tell if my professor hates me or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: What do you mean? What did he say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t know if he likes me. I have no idea really. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t know \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: I guess I feel like when I do well in a class there should be some kind of reward that comes with it or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Approval that she likes me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: There doesn\u2019t seem to be any of that I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Even if you get the A it doesn\u2019t mean that she likes you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Do you have any sense of how she feels about you? How does she come across?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: She\u2019s very stern. Very, very stern. Very (unclear) Although last semester when I had trouble \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I talked to you about it but I had trouble \u2013 it was actually this paper, the first draft \u2013 I didn\u2019t hand it in on time. And I sent her just like a kind of a roughish draft and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">I resent it to her and then we had the meeting and she was extremely understanding about it. We had a really helpful conversation and whatnot which was really nice. Yeah. It just was kind of like I\u2019m coming back this semester it just feels kind of, it still feels kind of vacuous in terms of \u2013 I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F2\">through this semester but I still feel kind of just floating around in there, you know. [0:12:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: just like some of those things like that I would suspect would come with like being somewhere for a while. Those things that make you feel comfortable with a place like that you felt a rapport with your professors. And you know, all that seems to be just this kind of \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">much different than when I started school, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: But in a sense it\u2019s kind of like a developing kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: It still feels like it\u2019s kind like a cold place in that sense. And I kind of noticed that a little bit this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: How many students are in your \u2013 they count up the total 2013-14 incoming class and how many \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: There\u2019s three divisions of 60 students approximately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And do all divisions of those 60 students take class together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So each division, like my division is D2. There\u2019s three of them. Last semester we had all of our classes together with the exception of legal research writing which like because it meets in groups of six or really 12 students. That\u2019s the only one like that. But all the other classes, same <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">students, same room, same seat. Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a pretty common thing in school, from what I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019m not really sure why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: In a sense at this point, I don\u2019t know what their reasoning is behind it, but there\u2019s definitely some benefits to it in terms of like you know it helps you kind of just connect with people \u2013 get three classes with 60 people in it. You feel you\u2019d be lucky to like make a connection with anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: That makes sense, right. You see the same person next to you every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561958\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: I have to imagine on some level there\u2019s a benefit to that, but I also think it helps with the grading, to control for certain things. I don\u2019t know. [0:15:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I asked maybe just to get a sense of how well one can get to know the class as a whole feels like and then also the professor. That\u2019s a pretty big class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s a big class. It\u2019s a big class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So it feels a bit impersonal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: It feels impersonal in that sense but like socially and it\u2019s also just like I haven\u2019t even gotten any grades back yet. And I\u2019m already starting my second semester. You know, there\u2019s also this like \u2013 it\u2019s also structurally set up to just really facilitate a feeling that you have no idea what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">the hell is going on. I could have failed all of my exams. I (unclear) feel like dropping out, you know what I mean? I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re in the dark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Most likely there is along with this professor, there is a kind of way you\u2019ll know what the place really, how it feels about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I was just, I liked spending that time at home with Laney. And I think that I\u2019ve been thinking about this so much against the backdrop of that, you know? The way it didn\u2019t really feel like that when I was at home with Laney so much spending so much time with her and you know with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">our cat which has been a lot of fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: I just really like, I would like to have more time like that. It made me happy, you know? It made me feel good to be able to put my energy in that direction, you know? And I was able to be like a better partner and companion for Laney for the last couple of weeks than I am, that I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">I can be right now. You know? And that made me feel better about myself, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What did you feel about it when you have that time to devout energy to be there? More available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: It seems more right. It seems like \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to say it. I just feel better. I feel more confident. I feel happier. I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s also just like \u2013 plus it\u2019s demanding. Whatever. It\u2019s not surprise or anything, but I guess sometimes it feels even weird to me that I get a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">frustrated when I know I have to make this decision to like have to focus my energy in this one sphere and just want to see her because it just requires that. But I\u2019m also noticing how little I feel I get back from it. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Like I have to focus energy on this thing and I feel lost in it. In a way like a formula in my head that just works out like it just seems to make more sense if I put it somewhere else. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Is it kind of captured by that feeling with the teacher, with the professor that you know you worked hard, you got the A and at the end of it you really don\u2019t even know where you stand with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Why would someone need to focus their energy on that? You know? Wouldn\u2019t it just make more sense to invest yourself more in doing things that you get something back from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: You get a return.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:20:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. No I see it. Yeah. I mean it\u2019s interesting. I guess the way you put it. Just thinking about how much you have invested into this past semester and how impersonal it still feels to you. I mean maybe partially there\u2019s something that feels like you\u2019ve gotten something that degrades \u2013 if <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">you get good grades it\u2019s something like a reflection of hey I invested this and I got this in return.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561958\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: No, I think that\u2019s right. I think if I had my grades from last semester right now and I got really good grades in all of them I think I would probably feel a little bit different about it. You know? But I almost feel like if I got really bad grades like this wouldn\u2019t be the first thing I\u2019d think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">of but I\u2019m so (unclear) that I would even feel worse about how I used all that time and energy, you know, with respect to Laney or something. (Pause) I guess it just takes a lot of time and energy and I\u2019d like to be able to use that for other things. Like one thing I\u2019d really love to be able to do would <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E32\">be to be able to work that divide more effectively, be able to do both of those things better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Oh, I know, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I feel like I hear about people being able to do that really well and stuff and for some reason I just shouldn\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Do you have a sense of what\u2019s complicated about that, how it\u2019s challenging for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even know if I would like want to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What about it doesn\u2019t seem right to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: I guess I just feel like that\u2019s something I couldn\u2019t do or something. Sometimes I think about things that way, you know? Like I have this like assumption in my head that it doesn\u2019t seem possible that other people can do things like they, this is not something that I would be capable of doing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">you know? And I don\u2019t even know where that comes from but I think about that kind of stuff sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there is some way that it does seem like you know there\u2019s a very strong divide between schoolwork and being at home or schoolwork and being in kind of work mode and off work. Almost like it\u2019s two different worlds that you\u2019re in. One is a world with Laney and the other being school and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">I mean I will say that it does seem to be that somehow the line seems to get a little more fluid as opposed to it felt like even a stronger divide in the past, I think when you were at Providence College.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, like at Providence College Laney was hyped about it. They were both the same. My school responsibilities and my concern about keeping a connection together were both achieved through my schoolwork. The way I see it now is like now they\u2019ve been kind of disaggregated now they\u2019re in two <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F31\">different places that require different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s interesting, too, that in saying all of this I still don\u2019t freak out too much at all about my schoolwork. I get anxious about this stuff but I\u2019m not like anxious about how I\u2019m doing in school which is worth noting. [0:25:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s definitely changed as we\u2019ve been saying. But you know just to say how kind of, I don\u2019t know, like an enduring characteristic of the way work and not work, outside of work structures, I just remember it makes me think a little bit about what it was like meeting or talking while <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F91\">you were working at camp for instance. Your description of like being not only talking to me but before that over the years how separated you felt like your existence at camp was from everywhere else. You know, some of that is kind of like it comes with the territory of camp. It\u2019s kind of the idea of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F92\">camp anyway is to get away, but there was something kind of striking like you noting like, \u2018wow, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking to you on the phone while I\u2019m here at camp.\u2019 And the thought of doing it before that seemed like really unimaginable in the sense that you maybe never even imagined it, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561958\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: No, absolutely. I can remember that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and so it\u2019s almost like there\u2019s this way that it\u2019s not like a really interwoven kind of experience that you feel or that you go from one world to another world and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s part of the territory but I also hear you say that maybe for other people it\u2019s maybe a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">little bit more. You know, the transition isn\u2019t as stark or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a possibility to wear both hats or something. Like if this is something like if I wasn\u2019t talking to you, you know, if I was talking to Eric or something, I would preface it by saying, never repeat this but I won\u2019t say that to you obviously I don\u2019t have to, but sometimes like a lot of times <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF1\">the way my schedule works a lot of time when Laney is working at the grocery store which is not too far away from my school, you know, when she\u2019s getting out I like 7 or 8, I\u2019ll just stay at school and study until then, and we\u2019ll go home together and I\u2019ll carry groceries and stuff. There\u2019s times when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF2\">I have a lot of work to do and I\u2019m not done and I know I\u2019m not going to be done by the time Laney gets there, and I\u2019m wanting to be working on it because I want to get my work done at night to be prepared for class \u2013 I want to do it, I want to get it done. I mean I want to meet that goal of this assignment <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF3\">and finish it. I think in my head sometimes like kind of like in an abstract way like a feeling in these terms I almost kind of like wish I wasn\u2019t with Laney in moments like that. I think about like imagine if like I wasn\u2019t with Laney and all the time I would have for school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be with Laney, you know what I mean? But I think that. [0:29:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: And it feels like a treasonous thought. You know what I mean? It feels, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: Disloyal or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: It surprises me sometimes that I think that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: Because I know that I don\u2019t literally want that but I do at those moments. I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s the point at which I see those things conflicting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: At times with Laney I don\u2019t want to be in school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right. Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: But it seems more, I\u2019m personally scared the more I think about it in terms of not wanting to be with Laney when I kind of like fantasize what I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of more acceptable to you to deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: (Unclear) the relationship for school. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Right. What \u2013 is it that it\u2019s more acceptable to think that about school rather than say, Laney, for yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: Like if someone came up to me right now and put a gun to my head and said you can have school or you can have Laney. I would say I would still stay with Laney. You know what I mean. Obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561958\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I think that I do that calculation in my head sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: What, if you can kind of get into that mindset that t you\u2019re in in those moments, what\u2019s kind of going on for you? How does that enter your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: I mean I feel like it\u2019s a big secret on the one hand that I even think it. It\u2019s like a secret conversation that I\u2019m having with myself. That\u2019s one big thing that I feel. But there are times when I\u2019ve thought that a little bit and then I\u2019ve even got a sense of myself like if what you really need <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201271\">tonight is another two hours to study, I mean, the alternatives aren\u2019t be with Laney and don\u2019t study for two more hours tonight or study for two more hours tonight and don\u2019t have your relationship with Laney. I mean I think that sometimes. Maybe your finishing your studying tonight is not possible only <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201272\">if you aren\u2019t in a relationship with Laney. You know what I mean? Like I\u2019ll study at the library tonight to finish my work and I\u2019ll see you at home. That\u2019s obviously a possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t think about it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no. What is it instead? What does it kind of set up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: I guess in some sense I kind of feel like if I take those extra two hours and I don\u2019t have a relationship with Laney or something, I\u2019m hurting my relationship. What if I didn\u2019t have this thing I have to protect?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yes.

You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah, it would be that kind of like I have this feeling of wanting and needing to protect this other relationship with Laney but I don\u2019t want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: I kind of don\u2019t.

You know? What if I didn\u2019t want to do that? Like how good would that be in a way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s interesting you know, I\u2019ve got to just share with you that I certainly can\u2019t imagine this is all \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to suggest that this is all it is to you because I can\u2019t imagine that it would be. But it\u2019s interesting when you describe the time with Laney, what was most salient <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D1\">to you at least in your description earlier today, what was important about being with her was the sense that you were really able to take good care of the relationship and really tend to her and have a relationship. It was almost like some sort of feeling of you were able to be responsible in the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D2\">you wanted to be. It was a particular \u2013 that was the most salient thing you described about it. And I was thinking about how more generally one of the more salient things about the relationship is the responsibility component of it that I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s worth unpacking but like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D3\">ends up being kind of like, again, reiterating, one of the more salient things was the responsibility you feel towards her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: No, that resonates. Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s like the currency.

The ability to be available and the ability to prioritize. The ability to do those things.

Who knows if Laney even noticed? I don\u2019t know. In a way it doesn\u2019t matter, you know? I still felt good in a way that I don\u2019t on a weekend or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of similar I think in terms of how you felt about \u2013 and again this has changed since school, like how you\u2019d feel about grades in a way. It was like \u2013 or your work. It would be just kind of like \u2013 the payoff would be in all that hard work was really you would end up feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201491\">like, okay, I did a good job here and that\u2019s what becomes very salient to you as reflected by the grades and now it seems like the pressure is a little bit more relieved, it\u2019s not as strong. It actually opens up, \u2018what am I doing this for?\u2019 And being in a way, opens up other possibilities of what it <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201492\">does mean to you, more clearly in some ways. Is that making sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s interesting. I thought you were going to \u2013 I thought when you started that sentence you were saying something totally different. And actually, I wasn\u2019t really paying attention. I just am saying I\u2019m sorry. I thought that you were initially going to draw an analogy between the way that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">used to feel like I have to put everything I have into my school work because that\u2019s the only way I feel like I would be able to handle whatever the consequence, whatever the outcome of it was. If it was a good grade then great! If it was a bad grade then at least I did everything I could, I mean I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B2\">(unclear) you know? At least I can say I did everything I could. At first I thought you were going to draw an analogy between that and like my approach to my relationship with Laney. I feel like I\u2019m opening myself up to the same criticism by not being able to do those things, to uphold all those responsibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: Because initially I wanted to say that no I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the same thing at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: Because they don\u2019t feel that way to me but it just was interesting. I never thought of it that way. Do you know what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like if you didn\u2019t put all of yourself into Laney and something went wrong you\u2019d feel like you\u2019d only have yourself to blame kind of thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I thought you were going to be suggesting \u2013 like a similarity between those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re sort of saying now that you look at it now they\u2019re not analogous?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">CLIENT: That doesn\u2019t really \u2013 well I would say that but it\u2019s interesting because you didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t say that I was thinking that. I ended up thinking that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: Ultimately. On my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: But that doesn\u2019t really ring true to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: That wasn\u2019t what I was going to. But I see where you\u2019re going with it. But anyway, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What did you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: I guess, in a way they seem similar. I don\u2019t know. I guess in some sense they might be similar in that I just, I worry a lot about maybe like me hurting Laney\u2019s feelings or something, hurting her, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">THERAPIST: UN huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">CLIENT: I think I alleviate some of those concerns by doing certain things, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: Which may or may not have anything to do with it but for whatever reason give me a sense of calm, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: And feeling good, I guess, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20170-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20170-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561958\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: I mean I\u2019m feeling like feeling good is not feeling (unclear) because like I feel good when I check the oven because it\u2019s (unclear) than the way I feel when I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: I feel like I\u2019m saying the same things I said last semester in a way. I feel like I\u2019m being repetitive or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: What if you are?

I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Well, one thing that was coming to mind was that you felt, you\u2019ve expressed kind of concern about that here that what are you bringing in, how much effort are you bringing in and if you don\u2019t, what does it do to the relationship, you know? Yeah, like if you\u2019re not tending to the garden, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F1\">know, are things going to rot or something and I think like you\u2019ve even expressed concern about that like when you come here and you feel like I think you mentioned last semester a bit like I haven\u2019t been able to think as much as I would if I wasn\u2019t in school. How does that impact this? How does that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F2\">impact us? How much does \u2013 something starts to emerge in you like a kind of a worry, a danger or something about the \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve also fantasized about not coming here anymore in those moments, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">THERAPIST: Um hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">(Pause): [0:43:08 \u2013 0:43:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">CLIENT: That generates a conflict between those sets of demands and whatnot. I mean I feel like those are \u2013 I feel like that\u2019s a very common kind of way in which things play out amidst different spheres of my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think in a lot of ways at least it bothers me a lot of different ways. I think it makes it difficult for me in a lot of ways for me to enjoy things that could be really enjoyable like I mean all the things that we\u2019re talking about right now are incredible things like my relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D1\">with Laney, continuing to do this, being in school. Those are all fantastic things, you know? I guess it would be really nice to be able to enjoy the most fantastic things in my life instead of letting them just turn into these sources of negative energy or something, that make me feel bad about myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">CLIENT: Are more than kind of cursory, service level engagements, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Like you\u2019re very aware of the kind of like \u2013 and one thing that becomes very (unclear) and salient to you is the kind of investment that one has and one must make into things that one really cares about.

Like, is it a zero sum game? That\u2019s what it feels like. Sort of what it always comes down to. You know, like I got like 100 units of energy and I feel like all of the things in my life require 75 of them or 100. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">CLIENT: In a sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they might be all things that you have in your life because you wanted them, but it still takes a \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t require energy and work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">CLIENT: I mean yeah, that\u2019s it. Nothing \u2013 I feel like the way I think about things is that there isn\u2019t anything good that doesn\u2019t require that from you. They\u2019re all unique in that sense. I would love to be able to find a place where I could be where I could just enjoy those fantastic, awesome opportunities <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A31\">that I have. Which they are. You know what I mean? They\u2019re in many ways \u2013 I\u2019m the luckiest person in the world to be able to do these three things the way I am. You know what I mean?
