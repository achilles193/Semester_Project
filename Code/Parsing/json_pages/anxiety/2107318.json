So we're on for today and then we're on for Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Friday, yeah. (pause) So I'm sick still, but I think the stomach problems are stress, and I really had a lot of trouble producing going into this trip for the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: The first trip.

I'm just \u2014 like I'm not \u2014 I don't have much appetite. I'm a little (inaudible at 00:02:32) (pause) It's like the kind of connectivity is attenuated. I'm very familiar [with that]. (pause) And I guess what's interesting is that at least this time, my sense is that it began with that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">kind of attenuated connectivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">In other words, it wasn't like the stress of doing something made me feel like some kind of disconnection from the project. I don't quite know how to describe it. But it's just hard for me to get my head around what I have to do. It's not very \u2014 like what the burden on me to produce is not actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">that great. It's a short piece and if I were to produce it, everything would be fine. But there's something, there's something in the way, and I don't quite know what it is. But there's a feedback loop, and it kind of moves in lock-step with this sense of disconnection. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Or rather, there's a sense of disconnection and it's associated with not being able to deliver, and associated with not being able to deliver is very familiar. Stress and difficulty eating and kind of interruption of daily routines and all of that and they reinforce each other. So like I can see the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">mechanics of it. There's nothing new about it. There's no real insight to be gotten from it in that sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Or rather, the model doesn't get, you know, filled out, in an especially novel way. But I can see the way they interact. And there's no real reason that I can \u2014 you know, where before I think we were, you know, looking for some rationalization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: (laughter) Hopefully a rationale more so than a rationalization. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Rationale, fair enough. Freudian slip, right? That's \u2014 I'm pretty self-critical. Yeah, rationale. Some rational basis for understanding it, that's what I meant to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Literally, rationalization. I don't see one here. (pause) The one thing that's different is this one is actually [for Kevin], so maybe there's an unusual amount of something associated with it. It's like directly. I mean, all of them are but somehow \u2014 I don't know. I don't know why. No, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">is really no different than other \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I think what I gather is different about this one from things you've had to do recently is that the stakes are high.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: And you're kind of really beyond this \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Maybe I'm choking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: But that doesn't fit in with how we've understood \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: \u2014 these recent instances of your having difficulty producing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: I mean, only if we're looking for kind of a single factor analysis then yes, there's no reason why the same phenomenon couldn't be promoted by \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107318\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.

I don't. We have just gotten through a rough patch whose resolution is, you know, kind of \u2014 (pause) Just that I'm handling things, and the idea that I can't handle things is hard.

I feel very capable of doing it, but I'm not doing it. I feel eminently capable of doing it. I feel as if it would not take, you know, an impossible effort to do it. It's still in plenty of time. It's a little later than I said it would be, but you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">know, certainly not fatally so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: At least I'm scheduled to leave tomorrow.

And it doesn't have to. Like I feel \u2014 I kind of feel it turning in my hands and yet it's not turning yet. But there's something very very powerful. It's a very powerful countervailing force to this sense that all I need to do is just sort of take it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: There's something very powerful countervailing right now, and I don't really know what it is. (pause) Like I see the model, I see this tension, I see this \u2014 you know, the way that these phenomena interact, but I don't totally understand what this countervailing force is and I don't know how <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D1\">to arrest it. It's really where I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: And it's something that's kind of dead-set against your taking this opportunity, against your being productive, against your being connected?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: (pause) (coughing) Excuse me. I don't know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">When you say it, I feel resistant. (pause) But I called it a force, so you know, you're just using my metaphor. I guess you're giving it kind of \u2014 you're anthropomorphizing. I don't know. I mean, you know, it's appropriate. It's anthropomorphic. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: (laughter) Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: But I don't really understand it, understand what it is.

(pause) I don't feel, actively right now, I don't feel fear. You know, I know that it's very frightening. I know that an hour ago, I felt very frightened and was, you know, engaging in the usual kind of dissociating, looking for some activity to \u2014 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107318\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">But Jennie (ph) \u2014 I'm sure that Jennie (ph) knows that, frankly she's seen it before. She knows that it's stress. (pause) Anyway, I don't feel frightened right now. I feel actually a sense of well-being, talking about this. I think because I'm not running from it. It's the running from it that's really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">upsetting, discomforting, discomforted. That's what really makes me feel just inconsolable, is the running from it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">It's kind of weird to realize, and yet I mean here we are. The purpose of this discussion is to talk to you about it, whereas I can't talk to Jennie (ph) about it, I feel right now. I mean, I feel as if I could do the thing right now. It's almost as if the running from it, that's a very strange kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A51\">of fractal image. You know, the fact that I can't talk about it with Jennie (ph) makes it difficult to do. There would be no id if it were done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">So it's almost as if the difficulty that I'm having with this is not about the task itself or the job itself, it's about Jennie (ph) in some way. I don't know. I feel tangled up as I try and tease all of these threads out. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Like I gather the disconnection is with her.

That, you know, what you're going through will make sense to me, I mean to the extent that it makes sense to us at this point, and that I will listen <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C91\">and there aren't the kind of concerns there are now with talking to Jennie (ph) about it. I'm not saying I'm performing some amazing function or have some special insight.

But it sounded to me as though a few minutes ago you were saying that you didn't feel it although you know you obviously did <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F1\">at home and so forth.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">CLIENT: I fear that it doesn't matter, as you were completing the frame.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">CLIENT: The thoughts that were in my head were all about, you know, what happens even if I deliver it now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD\">Like are they going to be able to get to it and have I screwed it up already.

The question isn't what the \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B3\">THERAPIST: So there two questions. One is whether either of our work is worth anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, touch\u00e9.

I mean, a few minutes ago you were kind of like \"hey, we don't know what's going on, this is new, it's different.\" Then you were like \"maybe it's this thing with Jennie (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201C11\">and the disconnection there is part of it which actually is like things before.\" And then we kind of independently hit on the same new thing and very quickly.

I mean when I said the fear is somatically directly over a sense of well-being, that's it. So the well-being is \"Oh, well that's interesting. I can look at this and I can call it for what it is, and I can say okay that might be it and that might be it and that might be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201C51\">it.\" And then the fear is that it's completely irrelevant because I just have this thing to do and either I can do it or I can't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C9\">CLIENT: What intrudes is the sense that the work of our conversations is moot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CD\">CLIENT: Either or both, because \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CF\">THERAPIST: [So we're in tune] because again just a few minutes ago \u2014 this is tricky. Sorry. I need to be very clear what I'm making an argument about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D5\">THERAPIST: And actually it sounds like we're kind of the same page. A few minutes ago we were again both, I think, sort of feeling some sense of what's going on here. You can come in, you can talk about it, you can feel reassured. Yes, we both know that doesn't necessarily mean you can produce. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201D51\">I had the feeling, maybe incorrectly so, that we're both seeing that as sort of a good thing and probably a stepping stone and something, as you pointed, out relates to the work we've done together.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107318\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">And then now the other side of it really emerges very strongly, the sense that \"well, maybe none of it is worth anything anyway and if I can't write, I can't write.\" So this is where I get to what I'm making an argument about which is that how you're experiencing this seems very much to do with what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201D71\">we're talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">CLIENT: I hope I'm experiencing this seems very much \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">THERAPIST: One moment this seems helpful and sustaining and the next moment, eh, it's probably irrelevant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">CLIENT: So repeat what you just said a second ago.
