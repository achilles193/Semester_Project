I was going back and forth between feeling really good and positive to the middle of the day where I just felt really down and sad. I went back and forth. I don't know if it's as I'm thinking about work and things are cropping up. I don't know.  Micah calls <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">me in the morning to reschedule the appointment from Friday. She was like, \"How are you doing? \" I was like, \"I feel great.\" I went to the registry and was in and out in five minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Whoa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. We all know what was there. (laughs) I get to the office and I didn't quite do everything I wanted to do, but there was just a point where I was going to Staples to do a file and I felt really down. But on the way home I perked up again. I went over and saw the kids. Ian just doesn't listen <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">to you anymore. \"Don't do that,\" and he just laughs at you. He's driving Jess crazy. The interaction between the two of them is driving me crazy. So I go over there and Lucille is playing on her little computer asking me, \"What's this? What's this? What's this?\" It was Ian's computer and he's watching <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">TV. It's just \"Arggh.\" Then when I left I was like, \"Now I've got to do work.\" I said, \"I'm going to get some Chinese food.\" I didn't do the work. I kind of have a client meeting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Sorry. Which day was this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: This was yesterday. Last night. I was exhausted most of the day, but still stayed up until 1:00 in the morning. There was a two-part episode of Criminal Minds on ION, so if you watch the first part at 11:00 you've got to watch the second part as well. I watched one at 10:00, too, so I saw three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">straight. I don't know why I'm kind of obsessed with that show now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What's it about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It's about the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI. These are the top criminal profilers in the country. They don't really try and solve the crime by the crime scene. They use the crime scene and how the body was positioned and get all these different things to set up a profile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Like a psychological profile?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. And they use that psychological profile to catch the person or find the person. Some of the episodes are just really done well. The first one \u2013 I actually think I saw it before when I didn't know what the show was about. Keith Carradine played this serial killer and he was just an awesome... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Who is Keith Carradine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: The Carradine brothers are actors, famous actors. One really famous Carradine...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: There's David Carradine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, he's the Kung Fu guy. This is his brother, Keith. There was an excellent movie, if you like westerns, The Long Riders. It's a bit violent, but it's the story of Jesse James. It's the James brothers, which is Stacy Keach and his brother, who plays Jesse James. The Youngers, which I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">is the Carradine brothers, and then there was another set of famous brothers. This gang was actually real brothers, and it was a great, great movie. A little long, but it was a great movie, really well done. Like my all-time favorite western. But he was great. Mandy Patinkin was on the show for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">first couple of years, and he's the best. He's awesome. This was an episode with him. The last six seasons he hasn't been on. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098634\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: \"My name is Inigo Montoya.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: (laughs) Princess Bride?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That was him, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. He and Carradine are sitting at a table at a diner and Carradine is telling him, \"I'm going to get out of here. When I finish my strawberry shake, I'm leaving.\" But he's interested in how they found him, so they tell the story in flashbacks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Right. Patinkin works for the FBI? Carradine is the serial killer? There sitting in a diner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. The local sheriff's department is all outside wanting to go in and kill the guy because he's captured the sheriff and he's like, \"I'm walking out of here when I'm done with my strawberry shake.\" \"You ain't going anywhere.\" He actually does walk out of there and goes free. It's really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">well done. The two of them \u2013 just two great actors \u2013 they keep showing close-ups of their faces and just the little tics and facial expressions were really well done.  So I don't know why I like it. I don't know if it's just the analyzing crazy people thing. They all have demons. There's this one guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">who's a genius whose photographic memory knows all the statistics \u2013 everything, you know? He was captured in the two-part series. There was a guy with multiple personalities. The son that was trying to help him was injecting him with dilaudid or some opiate to calm him and, again, after he kills the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">guy they all show up and he's like, \"Can I just have a moment alone?\" They're like, \"Sure,\" and they walk off. Then he goes back to the guy and he pulls the little vials out of his pocket, suggesting that he does drugs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So the dad with multiple personality disorder is a killer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: He's the son who kills his dad so he continues being his dad, so he's three people. He's an archangel, Rafael; his dad; and then himself. He's a tech-service support guy and so he goes into people's computers remotely and turns on their web cam. When they sin, he goes and kills them. It's one <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">of these biblical things or whatever. He just happened to catch Reed. He tortured him for a while and at the end they were going to shoot him. The FBI came. They had the camera. They gave the camera of him to the FBI. He was giving little clues. Interestingly enough, he goes and takes the two vials <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">of dilaudid at the very end. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, he needed a moment alone to grab the drugs. Pretty interesting. They all have some kind of demon, you know. Something's happened in their past. Somebody gets murdered and later \u2013 good show. I watch it an awful lot because it's on ION all night long. There's nothing but crap on TV. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">morning didn't stress me out too much. I get frustrated with people who mark their parking spots. There's a woman who's doing it right outside our house. She's got a fricking Subaru. You can't pull into any spot, you know? Now it's clean, but the spot wasn't completely clean. I understand someone who's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">gone and made a spot immaculate. If I come home tonight and that spot is there, I'm going to park there and put a little note on her chair that I know her car and I know who she is and if she touches my car \u2013 I know who you are. I'll make it mine. But there will be spots. I'm just saying \u2013 I won't do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200413\">something like that. It's not good to get into conflicts with people like that. I shun conflict. The town has no school until Thursday. They've announced no school through Wednesday. They haven't announced school on Thursday. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098634\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Oh, my gosh. Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Number one: They use the school parking lots as emergency parking and they've just done such a horrible job of clearing the streets, so they've kept the parking ban on. Jess says it's because they've got to clean up the school parking lots, but I think it's just that they still have a parking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">ban so they've got to use the parking lots. There are going to be a lot of hell raised after this and I don't want to be the mayor. They did a poor job. Where the cars park it's actually kind of a little in-cut, so they're not right out there. There's a bike lane and then there's a regular lane. A snow <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">bank four-foot high from the plows goes all the way out into the lane and leaves about that much room between the yellow line and the snow bank. So these cars are in there for good. You would think, because this is a major artery in town \u2013 there are not many of them. This is it. You would think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200453\">this would be their first priority. Get the main streets cleared and then worry about the side streets. It's just a mess. Then the rain comes and...  I've just been making an effort to get home in time to get a parking spot and just walk over to see the kids. We're filing a financial aid. Jess wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200454\">Ian to go to this private school, so we both have to do an application. She wants to go over the application together so we're on the same page and are consistent. She wants to do it Thursday. I'm going to see Big Head Todd and the Monsters on Thursday. I'm by myself. It's Valentine's Day. Why should <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200455\">I take someone, not that there's anyone to take. So I was like, \"Can we do it Wednesday?\" Now I'm thinking she probably thinks maybe I have a date or something for Valentine's Day. It was really weird because I brought the tax forms. She has trouble understanding that the partnership file has its own <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200456\">tax return but doesn't pay any taxes. They issue a K1, which we file with our personal tax returns, and that shows our income. She's upset because it splits 50-50. They're looking at us together. They're not going to say, \"Oh, you made less money, but he made more money so we're going to give you financial <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200457\">aid. We're married. I don't think they care that we're separated. We're paying the taxes half and half which, actually, we're not because she doesn't pay for the state tax; so I pay an extra $120 every quarter. It's not like we're keeping track of every penny. She spends for day care and all of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right. You just kind of work it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I dropped $5,000 on the attorney and our CPA, snowboarding lessons. I'm going to pay for half of camp. With what money, I don't know. I do have some loan funding this week, but most of that's spent. That struggle is going to come up eventually. I've got a meeting with a client today on a landlord\/tenant <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">security deposit; and it's just one of these classic Cameron-is-not-competent...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098634\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Is this the one that you were mentioning on Friday where it's a slam-dunk \u2013 but you're nervous anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm like, \"What is going on here?\" He doesn't even address the fact that it wasn't kept in a state bank account; and that's a big one. Segregated funds in a state bank account. If you don't do that, it's automatic treble damages, automatic reasonable attorney's fees \u2013 no ifs, ands or buts. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">And you can't do any counter-claims, because they filed counter claims; some of which weren't even valid. You can't subtract maintenance from a security deposit. They claimed some damages. But the way to cure that is on demand, you return the security deposit. Well, they sent a demand, certified mail, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">as the lease says \"notices are to be certified mail to the address on the front.\"  They followed that and they never picked it up. Even if they say, \"Well, I was out of town,\" whatever excuse they can come up with for not picking it up, the filing of the lawsuit is considered a demand and, once again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D3\">you should immediately return the security deposit. He's offered to return the rest of the security deposit, but they haven't returned it. Making the offer to do something is not the same as doing it. So, even if for some reason they don't find that the original demand was valid, the filing of the lawsuit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D4\">was a valid demand. I'm going through every little piece here and reading the statute over and I've got a book this thick on tenant's rights and a bench memo from the housing court judge and I'm just like (sighs).  The guy has no landlord\/tenant \u2013 he's got dozens of continuing legal education things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D5\">and nothing on his website says landlord\/tenant. You'd think he'd pick up a damned statute and read it. Google it. You can just Google it and there's a ton of stuff out there. It's on the Attorney General website \u2013 being a landlord. He gave us a check from what they deducted; the remainder of the security <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D6\">deposit that they did return was from a bank out of state, the account from the landlord. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Right. So you won it five times over. The question is why you're so anxious, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Right. And he doesn't even address the bank account in his answer. He addresses the fact that he didn't sign, he didn't give a list of damages, and you've got to sign it under the pains and penalties of perjury. He didn't do that. He thinks that's a technical violation, which I don't know if <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">not subjecting yourself for criminal prosecution for lying is a technical violation. If you sign something under pains and penalties of perjury and there's a material fact in there that you lie on, you can go to jail. I'm going to tell my client. I'm like, \"If something's too good to be true, it can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">be.\" I don't know if I should tell my client. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: I do this on everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you generally feel like somehow you fuck up. Whatever is going on, whatever the reality is, that you kind of fucked it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: I think a lot of my anxiety comes from this kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think you sort of maintain this sense of yourself as a kind of slacker and somebody who fucks things up and \u2013 I can't quite find the word I'm looking for \u2013 if there's a mistake somewhere, you probably made it. You were the slacker. You didn't do what you were supposed to do. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">weren't responsible in some way. I think you just generally kind of walk around with that. Even to the extent when you know full well in your head that that's not what's going on, you feel that way anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098634\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I think it makes you pretty anxious to actually take yourself seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: I do it with non-work-related stuff, too.

I was just thinking about the possible significance of your not having noticed that the chair goes back, even though I'm sitting here like this and do all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Can you see the felt on the back of my collar?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Very slightly under the collar. Not unless I was paying attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: This suit is so old it's starting to fall apart. I never wear it, but I'm like \u2013 you know. It had to get in the rotation. I put some double-sided tape back there to hold it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: I think that projection is exactly the sort of thing we're talking about, because I think that suit looks fine.  I think it makes you feel really anxious and really responsible when you take yourself and your points seriously. That was true with Jess often, and you always felt like she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">winning. It didn't matter if she was arguing that 2 + 2 was 5, you kind of felt in a way that she was right. Even if she wasn't right, it didn't really matter because she was right. I think it makes you anxious to take what you know or your point of view or your competence seriously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: What pill is there for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: (pause) So you know I've mentioned the counselor in the E&amp;G (ph?) group, and it's like sometimes she looks attractive and sometimes she doesn't. [...] (inaudible at 00:23:32) She's leaving the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: This is not the auto-body woman, who is also attractive and is also leaving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yes. The counselor is single, but she lives in the suburbs and I think you mentioned, \"What's the big deal about living in the suburbs?\" I have a sinking feeling in my stomach. I don't know if that's because she was leaving or we were losing another member; because we're kind of, once again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">in that spot where they may shut the chapter down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Right. [...] (inaudible at 00:24:13)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: I really didn't get a chance to say good-bye to her, so I sent her a note on Facebook. I've read it several times, thanking her for \u2013 she does the educational moments, and they were good. She gives good health tips that, if I ever get my act together \u2013 you know. And then I threw in there that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">I was going to miss her and her lovely smile. I read it several times. I keep thinking it's creepy, but it doesn't seem creepy to me; but she's not responded. She read it Saturday afternoon. It tells you when people read it. I just thought that was odd that I haven't gotten a response back. :Oh, thanks <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200812\">for getting me $20,000 back from my landlord. Blah, blah, blah.\" She's having a party in a couple of weeks at her office for E&amp;G, even though she's leaving the group and I don't want to go now. First of all, it's the suburbs. Having a couple of drinks and then driving home... Once again, I'm just \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200813\">why no response? The only thing I can come up with is that I creeped her out in some way. I mean, when someone sends you a message, you respond to it. (pause)  Initially I was expecting, \"Can I make you dinner and have sex with you?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098634\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: Right. Naturally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: But that didn't happen. Nothing's happened. That makes me think she's interpreted it in an uncomfortable way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: I get it, but you're sure you've creeped her out. You're sure that means that you've fucked up, and that, therefore, you'd be ashamed to go to her office because she rightly has found you creepy or justifiably has found you creepy. (pause) I don't know. It doesn't sound creepy from what you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">describing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: I thought about what I was going to say. I didn't just fire something off. I wasn't drunk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and it's one line like that when she's leaving the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: It was a complement. Ian and I are playing this game on the iPhone. The way that you get extra money to buy players and all these cards and stuff like that is you can go and watch videos of games and then have a chance to download the game or you can go to websites. It gives you all these opportunities <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">through co-marketing to get money. One of the things was to sign up for this free dating website called Zoosk. I did a quick profile. I didn't upload a picture, and the first flirt that I got was from some morbidly-obese woman. This morning I got one from this woman which I think is, once again, way <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D2\">the fuck out there, maybe it's in the County or something. Her picture is like she would be attractive, but she's trying to look sexy and it just isn't coming across. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Not working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: (laughs) I didn't read the message from the fat chick \u2013 not that I'm one to... but I'm not Jabba the Hut. But it was something like, \"Oh, I just dropped something. It's my jaw.\" I'm like \u2013 my picture is not on the website. (both laugh) I don't want to say, \"Do you say this to all the guys who <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200911\">don't have pictures on the website.\" I've got to get off that website. It's kind of funny, though. I'm entertained by it to some degree. I've got my name, where I live and all. (pause)  Something that I kind of thought defined Jess and what her main problem is \u2013 one of the libertarian things that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200912\">follow on Facebook had a cartoon of three soldiers. The first one was a woman carrying a gun. They're combat soldiers. She says, \"I hope that I'm not distracting to you.\" The second soldier says, \"Don't worry. We're married.\" And the third soldier says, \"To each other.\" So here it is, women in combat, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200913\">gays in the military \u2013 whatever you think of the military, this, to me, is a positive thing. I shared it and I said, \"What a country.\" Jess was completely offended by the whole thing because it's military. She's anti-military. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: What does that mean? We shouldn't have one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: Anything military. It's like she just gets so negative on things that she can't see through and \u2013 you know. I mean I don't think we should be in wars. This is a libertarian website that things we should cut back on defense and get out of all of these countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098634\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: Right. The point was in part about the military; but in part just about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: The advancement the country is making in equality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. For us it's social values. So you're saying the point it makes about who she is, is that she's so focused on what she's focused on, that she couldn't get the point, couldn't just laugh and enjoy or appreciate it or see what you're trying to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: It's like an inherent negativity in her. She's being awful nice to me, though, which I don't know if it's because I'm [...] (inaudible at 00:32:31) and coming over and spending time with the kids. I come to the door and Lucille is not crying. She's like, \"Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy.\" She made <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">me leave the other night. She was like, \"Go home.\" She wanted to go to bed. She was like, \"Go home, daddy. Go home.\" I don't know. She gets upset when I want to leave. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: She's being nice to you probably because you're kind of like being helpful and there with the kids and nice to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: I'm not being mean to her. (pause) I don't know what to make of this Adderall thing. I see benefits from it, but I'm wondering if I should be seeing more benefit from it. Like yesterday was kind of a low-motivation day, you know? I went into the office. I left because I wanted to get a parking space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You take your weekends off the Adderall?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: I'm trying to, but I was like, \"Well, for shoveling I probably should take one to get off my ass and go shovel,\" so I took one on Saturday. I don't think I took one on Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You started pretty recently so I can't imagine you'd be desensitizing yet, but you may want to check with Micah about how often to take holidays so that you don't upset the balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: I took it out West, too, because of the time change and everything like that. And then when I'm [burning down an objective with PCP.] (ph?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: What about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: I was just thinking that a guy on Criminal Minds became a drug addict because his dad beat him, burned a cross in his head...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: This is not one of the FBI agents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: No, this is the serial killer. They talked to his Narcotics Anonymous buddy and he was saying how he would take dilaudid and mix it with a psychedelic; just get as far away from reality as he could. That's where that came from. I don't inject myself with medication or drugs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I get that. I kind of knew you were kidding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: I don't even know where one would get PCP. They probably don't even call it PCP any more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Target?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: Target. What aisle? (both chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I think the Adderall is helping significantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: I was worried because last night with all the noise and the kids and Jess, it's been two nights that just haven't gotten to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Even with Adderall there's still real life. I guess what I feel like I don't understand is that Ian is driving Jess crazy, the two of them are driving you crazy, Lucille, as two year olds do, is wanting your attention every three seconds...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: \"What's this? What's this? What's this?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah and that sort of thing \u2013 well, of course, you've had enough after however long. It feels like the Adderall should be doing more for that or you should be more patient or resilient to it? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098634\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel like, with all the medication I'm on, it just felt like I'm letting so much stuff go, especially with the storm and people being assholes. There is a lot of stuff that bothers me in these storms \u2013 people who won't walk on the sidewalk, you know? I'd much rather slip <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C51\">and fall on the sidewalk than get hit by a car. That's my preference. It freaks me out when I'm driving and there are people walking in the street. Who knows when the car all of a sudden could skid, you slam on the brakes and the car skids? People are marking their spots and that kind of gets to me <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C52\">a little bit, but I'm not as angry as I used to get over it. I guess maybe it's just too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe it is too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: I literally wanted to get up and leave. I was downstairs looking for a file. I was very frustrated because I was hot and sweaty. I just walked over in my heavy jacket, which I shouldn't have worn; and couldn't find the file I was looking for, and was just very frustrated. When I leave, Ian doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C91\">say he doesn't want me to go, but it's clear he's bothered by me leaving. Extra hugs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling sad or guilty that you didn't want to stay longer or felt so much like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">CLIENT: I stayed, but eventually I left. I actually started feeling sick a little bit, but then I went and got Chinese food, which I didn't eat all of it, most of it. I don't know. (pause) I don't know if I'm expecting too much because I have seen improvement, but I want more. At the same time, I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">want to go tell Micah this stuff because I don't want her to stop weaning me off Wellbutrin. I just don't see any point in me taking that, especially with the Adderall and the Prozac. (pause) I just feel like I'm going back and forth a lot. I want to be more level, you know? Things have definitely improved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess it sounds though like you're kind of getting used to like a bit of a bumpy ride, figuring out what's going to be better and what isn't. How do you feel better one minute and then feel shitty the next? What's going to throw you and what isn't: the traffic \u2013 not so much, but being <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF1\">with the family for a little while did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: I couldn't figure out why all of a sudden I was sad yesterday at the office. I don't know if it's just lack of talking to people and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Well we have to stop for now, but that's the sort of thing you can try to figure out, what was happening, what was going on in your mind. It's not unusual for somebody to have a change \u2013 even an intense change \u2013 in how they feel. It's because of something that's going on kind of in the back <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D31\">of their mind or is related to something they're upset about, but isn't front and center as they're going about their day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">CLIENT: Because Doctor Grace won't respond to my message.
