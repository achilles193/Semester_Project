Or how I went from basically I think benignly following along to having a wrong idea that I think, then, made you feel vulnerable to me thinking something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B91\">inaccurate. And that also felt hurtful.

Where I think pretty quickly, I went from seeming more benign as you were <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">talking about things that I think do make you feel vulnerable.  Your anxieties, your uncertainty of how to deal with them, the time pressure you\u2019re feeling. That\u2019s stuff you\u2019re worried about it. And you\u2019re being open about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">But then, I think it got dangerous, there, when it felt like I had a view of that might have been off. And I think in a way that you wouldn\u2019t have felt good about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that you thought that maybe I had the wrong idea. But also that you don\u2019t want to think I see you as somebody <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">who doesn\u2019t want to be vulnerable. You didn\u2019t want to think that I see as you somebody who isn\u2019t interested in connected with people. That sucks. I can understand that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">But I think that made it feel a little more dangerous. Made me feel a little more dangerous or threatening or something like that.
