Jessa, how are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Hi Debbie, good how are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Good. Before I ask you about your homework and anything else, I just want to mention something in relation to a confusion you\u2019ve shared you feel, something you are confused about that you brought up last session but also during previous times we have talked. You have expressed that you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">not sure about the difference between a feeling and a thought. (Jessa agrees) That is at times you say \u201cI\u2019m think that \u2026\u201d and other times you say \u201cI feel that \u2026\u201d, because it\u2019s a common use of our language to say \u201cIt feels to me that \u2026\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Generally speaking, using the word feeling refers to emotions like anger, shame, guilt, fury, what\u2019s another hot one on your list? Oh yes, anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: How do you say that in a sentence? My emotion is\u2026 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: \u201cI feel angry\u201d and so forth. But when describing your contemplations \u2013 \u201cI think that his means \u2026\u201d, instead of \u201cI feel that it means\u2026\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh I see, ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s see if we can clarify that as we go along. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Ok.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: In general, the words emotion and feeling can be interchangeable but if you\u2019re confusing yourself about is this a feeling\/emotion I\u2019m having or just a thought \u2013 remember \u201cI feel...\u201d refers to emotions. Incidentally, when I say \u201cjust a thought\u201d I don\u2019t mean that thoughts are any less significant. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">Not at all. (Jessa says yes, agrees in background).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: It does clarify a little but not really. Because I\u2019m thinking about like what about when people say, not when people say, but when I have more of a gut instinct, what\u2019s a gut instinct vs. a thought? I don\u2019t even know necessarily that there is, I mean there could be a thought like, \u201chmm that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">not a good idea, don\u2019t do that, and don\u2019t go there\u201d. That might be the thought that you have, but yet sometimes there\u2019s something in your actual gut It\u2019s like a guttural response that you don\u2019t even think about, and I feel like I have a lot of those. I feel, that\u2019s where I get into some trouble because, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">I feel like or I think that \u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: \u201cI think\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I \u201cthink\u201d yeah, I caught it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I think in a way that I tend to run with my emotions as opposed to thinking, and then reacting. And so that is why I think I get confused about sometimes, when you\u2019ll say, \u201csit down\u201d, I think the reason why the homework is difficult is because sometimes I don\u2019t even necessarily know what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">thinking\/feeling. For me, it\u2019s probably more thinking because the feeling part would come thereafter. You could probably be a little clearer on what you were feeling if you knew what you were thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Now I\u2019m confusing myself. In other words, I think that sometimes I\u2019m doing things throughout the day and I\u2019m not really thinking, the thought, it\u2019s probably subconscious so I can\u2019t really get it out to know exactly what the (in the back ground she says something inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">Now I just lost my train of thought? Oh! That at times I\u2019ll have a thought throughout the day, I\u2019ll have a feeling throughout the day but it\u2019s hard for me to stop and even know what the thinking is behind it. So, and then that\u2019s the other thing, that sometimes there\u2019s many, many, many thoughts, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">I think that\u2019s where it gets difficult because you\u2019ll say well \u201cwhat is it that your thinking?\u201d but there\u2019s like 16, 17 maybe even 100 thoughts that go at one point. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to always know and I don\u2019t know if you have any advice for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well, my advice is careful that you don\u2019t get hung up with the need for certainty. Careful that you don\u2019t think that I need to know exactly and perfectly: \u201cwhat is IT that I\u2019m thinking that is creating this, or what are the 7 thoughts I am thinking that are creating this emotion?\u201d As if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">there is a certain right answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: At times when you experience an intense emotion, and it\u2019s not clear exactly what you are thinking, in all likelihood you still will be able to identify that you are on your way to creating panic, that you feel anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Then what I recommend you do is to hypothesize\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: About?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Think to yourself something like: \u201cIn all probability, I\u2019m telling myself, my mother shouldn\u2019t treat me like an imbecile\u201d or any other probable \u201cshoulds\u201d that you are thinking. Even though specific thoughts aren\u2019t clearly identifiable by you, as related to your \u201cpanic\u201d, you can usefully hypothesize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Exactly, ok, I see what you mean. Have fun with it I guess, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well if you can have fun, have fun. The important thing is to identify the probable irrational ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve had some fun with some of the identifying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s great! Very good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Even with the homework, I was like oh boy, here we go and the \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d and yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Good, very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Good because your saying that you had fun indicates that you might be taking it less seriously, which we\u2019ve discussed and if that is so could be very helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I see good positive results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m looking forward to hearing about those positive results. I\u2019ve observed some also. I want to hear what your experience is, but first does our conversation so far today clarify the confusion somewhat for you? Don\u2019t expect any \u201cperfect\u201d thought matched with your emotion when you are looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">for the irrational beliefs, just do the best you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: The best you can, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: And a word that might be good for you to use more frequently is \u201cimperfectly\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Imperfectly<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to do anything perfectly, whatever that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Enough to be useful is sometimes enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Enough to be useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s interesting because I think the more that I do these sessions with you, I just don\u2019t think I realized how hard I was or am, am, not was, because I still do it; on myself. I don\u2019t think it even ever occurred to me consciously maybe I knew it on some level but I don\u2019t think you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">realize it until you break down the thought or demystify what the actual thought is and that you don\u2019t have to have that thought, like it\u2019s empowering to realize that ok, you don\u2019t actually have to have that thought. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: And also that the thought that you\u2019ve held for decades may not have any truth to it \u2013 which you can only discover by thinking about that thought !...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s the other piece to. That it might not actually be true. My belief though always before, was that sometimes you\u2019ll have a thought but it could be a cover up for another thought. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense, but to me it does. Because I think that there are thoughts that we <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">don\u2019t always want to look at. It\u2019s like what\u2019s the underlying thing behind the thought that you think that you\u2019re upset about or you\u2019re upsetting yourself with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s more useful language. And hence the benefit of taking time regularly when you\u2019re experiencing unhealthy emotions to sit and contemplate and preferably in the early stages, write down the answers to \u2013 \u201cWhat am I telling myself, thinking that is, to make myself feel the emotion I want to change?\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Before I get, I thought you were going to say before it gets really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well, certainly before the unhealthy emotion escalates. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve used a lot of this stuff in my sessions but I used the horse example the other day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: The horse is running free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Which sessions, with your students?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah I used what you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I compared it to the horses running free<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And wild!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: And wild! Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Anyway, I don\u2019t want to go off on a tangent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Alright, no that\u2019s fine. So, does that help a little bit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: A little bit, yeah. I think I\u2019m always gonna have my curiosity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Curiousity is fine, healthy, as long as it doesn\u2019t become obsessive and unproductive. Just watch your language when you think, and when you\u2019re saying \u201cit \u201cfeels\u201d to me like\u2026\u201d \u2013 change it to \u201c I think that\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And regarding the question that you asked a few minutes ago, about having a gut feeling and you asked \u2013 \u201cWhat do I call that?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Call it a gut feeling! What do you call your gut instinct? Call it your gut instinct!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT :(Laughter) I get it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: And, can you not distinguish between gut instinct and anxiety?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Those are two different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Are they not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: No, they are yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Gut instinct and panic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Gut instinct can at best inform you. It may be accurate, it may not, but it can be perceived as offering information. It need not be disabling. Anxiety and panic are crippling at worst.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Um, Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: And even when anxiety is feeling less extreme, it doesn\u2019t contribute anything positive really \u2013 does it? I mean one can say there is healthy fear, such as one can feel if there\u2019s a poisonous snake nearby, and there\u2019s a certain amount of fear, although in our REBT approach\u2019s  terms, concern <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">would be the most helpful experience to have emotionally because with concern you\u2019re still alert, your adrenaline runs, you are more likely to take effective action but you\u2019re not going to be paralyzed as panic can allow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You THEN, feeling healthy concern, can still be motivated to move your ass!

See you caught yourself! Good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: I know, I know, but it\u2019s -I\u2019m not used to it so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: No you\u2019re not, and you often say that. It is accurate \u2013 you are not used to thinking in this way. So expect, without judging it as bad, to not to be used to it. Till \u2013 after some time \u2013 you may become used to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s like I\u2019m trying right now, really hard to like say the right thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Careful about \u201cright\u201d \u2013 about NEEDING to say the right thing. Better try to say the beneficial thing for your process and development. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Ok, right, so the beneficial thing, cause it\u2019s yours but it\u2019s not my feeling but I think that just as the brain is so complex this is really multi layered REBT, only because, I\u2019m thinking about what you just said, but then I\u2019m thinking about at the same time, I\u2019m thinking that the need for approval <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">that people have, and then I\u2019m thinking \u2013 well wait, if you think about the need for approval, in other words there are so many thoughts right? So then if somebody has a need for approval, then you go back and then you reflect well, wait, it\u2019s a \u201cshould\u201d and then it goes back to a \u201cshould\u201d but then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B92\">it could be something else. So it\u2019s like, just life and then REBT, I\u2019m not making sense but I\u2019m making sense in my own head. (laughs) In other words, I feel like, how do I explain it all, it\u2019s complex, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s simple at all, basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I think of it differently. I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yes, please share it with me. I want to be able to see it in a different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: You have told me that you are experiencing benefits when you watch your thoughts, and catch the unhelpful ones so you can change them. You said you feel you are benefitting and that\u2019s the proof the proof is in the pudding as they say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: We have a semantics thing going on here, but I feel that the REBT approach can be described as simple, because you don\u2019t need to have a massive intellect to understand how to apply the tools, do you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: I guess not, I don\u2019t know (quietly)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It seems to me that you\u2019ve comprehended the difference between demanding and preferring, the \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d vs. the \u201cI wants and preferences\u201d \u2013 haven\u2019t you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: No, I, I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And so, if on some level if you don\u2019t like the word \u201csimple\u201d, fine but it\u2019s not a complicated theory. Now, I think I understand what you\u2019re saying, that if someone is using REBT as you have been, it would be good for them to be willing to investigate thoughts as one might peel the layers of the onion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I mean, layers, lots of layers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Not all people see layers of thoughts \u2013 they think of different thoughts. If you want to use the word complex, okay, or you could use the word substantial. What REBT is not, is superficial, which some critics have called REBT. It\u2019s certainly I think can be called a depth therapy, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">it really does invite one to do that. To think about their thinking. But I think at this point we are getting into talking too much about the theory and I want to hear about you now. Last session we didn\u2019t really have time to talk about the homework of the previous session which you said you did, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF2\">was doing the ABC\u2019s, and at the end of last session you thought, and I agreed, that a useful homework might be for you just to focus on one self-help form thoroughly on your ABC\u2019s. That was the main homework and also the recommendation to not only do as homework now, but for the rest of your lifeto <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF3\">really have the intention to practice more compassion for yourself, in your life. There also was the suggestion that if you can find a photo of yourself as a child to frame it and have it around for you to look at as a reminder. Especially any time you are being tough and rough on yourself to remind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF4\">yourself: well if I was dealing with a child in this case, I would be softer, kinder, gentler and more compassionate. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: I did do my homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: So, tell me about your homework, and also when we first met tonight you also said you wanted to tell me some additional things. But first your homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: I did. Ok \u2013 so well I did a piece of the homework, but I didn\u2019t do all the homework I was really looking forward to doing the one that I was going to reflect on, and I think that today it is a little bit of a better day. The past two days since I\u2019ve seen you have not really been that wonderful, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">pain wise. It\u2019s misery; I\u2019m not going to lie. My pain level was through the roof, absolutely through the roof. I don\u2019t think I have ever had so much physical pain since I can remember, and so I was really having a hard time with just sort of even being like I couldn\u2019t settle in, I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D52\">was up till three a.m. one of the nights, just tossing and turning, not being able to find a comfortable position. Because as I mentioned earlier, I had shoulder surgery so I can\u2019t lean on my shoulder. I have this neck issue going on, and so just to even get comfortable was really hard.  So, the past <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D53\">two days have been really, really challenging for me, the good news is that though I haven\u2019t really done much of the writing, I\u2019ve done a lot of thinking and just really working on just perspective taking and trying to keep a better perspective and be kinder to myself, I watched a video of myself because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D54\">I don\u2019t have any pictures from when I was younger, but I do have videos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have ANY photos anywhere?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Not here. Not from when I was little, no. Not HERE, I mean at my parents\u2019 house maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Perhaps you could ask your mother to send you a photo? We can go back to that. Keep talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: So (small laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t look thrilled about it (getting a photo from your parents).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: NO, I\u2019m not thrilled about that suggestion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Which might make it good homework for you to push yourself to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Ok, so what I did instead was I watched, a video of myself that I have here that was from when I was about nine and it helped a lot actually just to watch the video and to actually see myself. It\u2019s not just a picture, I was actually watching myself live, and what I was doing and saying and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E51\">was good to, because I observed different things that I didn\u2019t as a child, you don\u2019t say back. You know my parents were on the video and so you don\u2019t say anything back as a young child but I was thinking oh, I could also when I watched it I remembered, if you can believe this, I remember all my thoughts, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E52\">when those things were happening and what was happening in the video, I could remember what I was feeling and I empathized with myself.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you wanted, I had compassion for what I experienced as a young child as opposed to not, and kind of sat and had a little chat with myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E53\">and said, Wow Jessa, you are really a survivor! (laughs) because it was a lot, it was a lot, and it was subtle. It was really subtle of what occurred in my home because there was so much love. But there were some subtleties that occurred, that I think were, really, really, nestled in and hard to unearth, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E54\">and so I was proud of myself for taking this step because I said you could have just lived a life and just continued like what I saw in the video, which is was a vulnerable, very, very vulnerable, scared really scared little girl who just wanted to please mommy and daddy and didn\u2019t want to, didn\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E55\">to say anything that was gonna rock the boat in any way. But there was some commentary that was put on the video and it was just the subtleties and the commentary, and I said wow! That is like amazing, that is it right there! That\u2019s it!<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Give me an example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Oh, here I have, not \u201cperfect\u201d example but a good example. (laughs) No, I was joking, I was gonna watch it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Good!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: My, father, I was actually at camp, I was actually at a summer camp and my parents came up to see me for visiting day, which is what they have in these camps that they do. They came up to see me and he was taping me pretty much from the second they got there and everything. Hi Jessa, how are <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED1\">you, and then my father says, I can\u2019t see this because I\u2019m now in the bunk so I didn\u2019t hear it but it was on the tape, He said Marge to my mother Don\u2019t look in the cubbies, you know it\u2019s not a good idea! And I was like laughing about it because it was so at the time, I felt it was just so damaging because\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Hang on; hang on, your laughing about it, it is not clear about what\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Well, I wasn\u2019t full laughing. At first I saw it and I said, Oh boy, I said this is it, because those critical comments were persistent and you know it was relentless, those comments were relentless, the commentary, so I didn\u2019t hear that particular comment because I was in the bunk, but then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">the actually went into the bunk and it was a lot of, maybe I\u2019ll share the video with you one day, but it was a lot of criticism you know, with \u201cwe know best\u201d and here it was visiting day and it was a month, and you only see your children one time in that summer and I didn\u2019t really, I felt that I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F12\">slightly ignored to be honest, in a way, my feelings were ignored, this is really hard to say by the way, for me, it\u2019s really, really hard to acknowledge it. Anyway, I just think that it was really nice cause you see a video and you see oh they were taking a video and it\u2019s what the family does, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F13\">I don\u2019t think that they ever really stopped to listen to my opinion, to what I felt, I think it was theirs rammed down my throat, and it\u2019s still that, it still goes that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">So I can look at it and take a step back now a little bit differently, in fact they just called right before our session, and you know they were sharing their thoughts with me or opinions with me about something and I said Ok, I\u2019ll take that into consideration and was really able to be calm about it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">instead of getting that AHHH.. which is why I think I personally get very confused with feelings vs. thoughts because I just jump to feeling as opposed to thought because when it was coming time for me to share my opinion it was generally tended to be not really heard very well, and that was kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F32\">common in my house growing. So, I am recognizing a lot of different things and I am coming to terms with a lot of things that parents aren\u2019t perfect and that they do the best that they can do and<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: SOME do the best that they can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yes, some do. Mine did. Mine definitely did. But you know I think that the REBT has helped me to take a step back and to be able to see that I can empower myself, I don\u2019t have to listen to everything that they say, that what they say is not the be all, end all and in fact I know a lot of things <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F71\">and I think I never believed that I was smart, and it was hard too, because I my teachers would always tell me, you know you\u2019re really bright, I would get that a lot, but I would go home and I would never ever, ever believe that I was intelligent because really my opinions were not really warranted <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F72\">in my house. It was just my parents conveying \u201cwe know best\u201d. So I just thought well I have some really smart parents but they created a dumb kid, that was, and I knew that that wasn\u2019t really the case but after a while that started to become the way that I spoke to myself; was you just don\u2019t know, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F73\">just don\u2019t know.  So, it\u2019s the language that I use with myself, which I understand now and it\u2019s been some really, really, harsh language that I have used over the years with myself of attempting to be a perfectionist and there\u2019s no such thing. I am seeing that as well, that we make mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: No such thing as perfection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Perfection, perfection, yeah. In fact, its making me question so much that I am like well if I have to have this neck surgery, Shit! I wish there was such a thing as perfection! (laughing) If somebody\u2019s going to operate on my neck \u2013 I want that surgeon to be perfect, but then this is the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">I thought about it. There\u2019s expertise and then there\u2019s perfection, and they\u2019re two different things and there is no such thing as perfection but there is such a thing as expertise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: And striving for excellence. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: That was how I tried to break it down in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: That makes good sense to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Alright, it seemed logical and comforting to my own self at the time and I was watching a surgery on the video, going you might be getting this so, you know, and I wanted to face it forward and just really see what were the possibilities in front of me and doing my own research and all that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201031\">kind of stuff, so it has been empowering in a sense and obviously nobody wants to have these ailments and these issues but I\u2019ve been taking it upon myself to do my own research, to look into different options, to see what\u2019s out there for me and I\u2019ve never really done anything like that. I\u2019ve always <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201032\">done, \u201c\u201cMom\u201d, \u201cDad\u201d, what do you think? What\u2019s your thought?\u201d (in a high voice) and they don\u2019t have any thoughts this time around so it\u2019s actually better, in a sense that I can do it and I don\u2019t need their approval. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a major change, isn\u2019t it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: It is, it is. There\u2019s definitely been, and I continue to tell myself that this is a life long journey, it doesn\u2019t end with, you know because those thoughts creep in throughout the day, it\u2019s not like I am sitting here like Jessa had a perfect day, with the perfect health and back, I\u2019m not sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">here saying that I didn\u2019t have that, but it\u2019s putting them into perspective and being able to check the thoughts I guess when they creep up but the past two days have definitely been you know a really big struggle. The interesting thing is that at work, I think some of the students; I\u2019m getting even <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201072\">better responses than I thought that I would get. Well, in some ways yes and in some ways no, I think that some of the students have noticed that there are little small changes besides the fact that I am in pain so I\u2019m probably more of a bitch. Can I say that on tape? I am a bitch, like I don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201073\">the same tolerance that I had last year or the year before. My pain tolerance is not, you lose a little bit when you\u2019re in chronic pain. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever had chronic pain and I don\u2019t wish that on anybody, but from a chronic patient to another they can look and say are a little more of a bitch, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201074\">you\u2019re a little more on edge, you\u2019re a little less kind, and I\u2019m a bubbly personality, I\u2019m a lot less bubbly. So I think that they might be noticing a little bit of that, but I think it\u2019s more than that. I think it\u2019s me actually being a little clearer and today one of my students said something where <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201075\">they picked up a table and I was like ABSOLUTELY NOT, and I said, \u201cyou might not have your strength, but you have your brain\u201d, he was angry, he was very, very angry and I said, \u201cyou DO NOT do that in my office\u201d. I said there\u2019s no way! And I said because of that you will not be invited back for two weeks <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201076\">to group. I said you will sit and reflect and think about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">CLIENT: And this kid has anger, like a whole lot if you can imagine. He got angry at another student and that was in the group and it was my job to protect the other kids, but I felt a lot of that had to do with REBT, because in the past, I might have said to myself, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have told him that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201091\">he can\u2019t come to the group, that\u2019s not right. I didn\u2019t do any of that. I was like; you\u2019re not coming back to my group, for two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Well, that sounds very constructive. It sounds very appropriate to me. You are teaching the child there are consequences to actions. I didn\u2019t hear you putting him down. You just said no, absolutely not little man, and presenting appropriate boundaries. Now I want to ask you about your evaluation <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B1\">of yourself as a bitch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">CLIENT: Oh, why am I evaluating myself as a bitch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Why did you label yourself in that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">CLIENT: Well because I just feel I don\u2019t have the same tolerance I think for things. So is that equated as a bitch? I\u2019m not a bitch. I know I\u2019m not a bitch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: The example you just gave me of the way you behaved with this boy who was acting out in anger \u2026. CLIENT: (inserts) Right<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: \u2026didn\u2019t sound bitchy to me, it sounded clear and definite and appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: Because of your role as counselor with children frankly I would feel very concerned, which I don\u2019t at this stage, if I thought that you were allowing yourself to act towards them based on unhealthy emotions. Which I\u2019m not getting that you are, but I didn\u2019t want to let go this opportunity <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201191\">to look at your use of the word \u201cbitch\u201d, which was your self-evaluation. A harsh one. Earlier in our conversation you were telling me about, and giving me an example of, your being clear, and definite in setting boundaries, and not giving yourself a guilt trip afterwards and not giving yourself a lengthy <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201192\">postmortem of should I or shouldn\u2019t I. Now, I would hope if you had let\u2019s say, smacked the boy, which would be highly inappropriate, unethical and illegal, if you had really acted out inappropriately in anger with him, I would hope that you would do a lengthy self-evaluation of your inappropriate \u201cbehavior\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201193\">and take appropriate action following that to prevent your doing that mistaken behavior again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: You know where I think the bitch thing came from? I think sometimes it (laughing) I\u2019m not gonna say it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Please say it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: MMM. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really, I don\u2019t (stumbling) Just say it? I think my mom\u2019s a bitch sometimes though and probably when I feel myself saying something or doing something I think it brings up maybe, Oh shit, your acting like your bitchy mother right now, because that\u2019s what I think I sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F1\">sound like. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it\u2019s a little more complex because I want to say, you\u2019re being a bitch and I feel I can\u2019t say that to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: Well, if you did say that to her, there would be consequences, and then it\u2019s for you to evaluate. Are you willing to take them or not? And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: No! (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: By the way, no one is ever \u201ca\u201d bitch. Someone may act \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: Like a bitch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yes they may be superbly talented at acting in bitchy ways. Just as no one is good or bad or evil 100%, no one is 100% a bitch. Maybe 99.9999999% (joking) but again with the REBT rational ways of thinking, we watch out for absolutes. Saying that someone \u201cis\u201d an anything means, they are that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201291\">and only ever that. Which is not humanly possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: Can I say nasty though? I feel that about her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: She acts nastily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Right, so sometimes, so saying acting, right, I mean<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: Acting in certain ways, or saying they are behaving in such ways, as opposed to saying they are being those ways, which is a statement about their personhood, when you say they are something (nasty or a bitch)\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: No I get it. I get it. I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: A good habit to get into, to distinguish, to separate the behaviors of a person from their worth \u2013 and that applies to you<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: (cuts into therapist\u2019s sentence) because you can accept people more and yourself<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: And yourself. Unconditional self-acceptance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, no absolutely. Yeah, I agree with that, and I get it. I just think that, I was angry at my mom the other night and so that\u2019s why it\u2019s coming up for me a little bit now. I was REALLY angry the other night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: You mean that you felt angry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I felt really, really angry at her. Can I just share it for a second? I was angry, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it might be coming up a little bit for me right now but, I was on the phone with her and something came up about the fact that she had reached out to me, I\u2019ve been really trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">hard, NOT to call her because I don\u2019t want to deal with her, by the time I get home, Oh my God, I\u2019m like, I haven\u2019t been like this. Sorry, so by the time I get home I happened to be having a good night right now, because I came from physical therapy, but I\u2019m usually not in the best of moods, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F2\">I\u2019m not feeling well, because I\u2019m not feeling that great by the time I get home, and so I avoid making phone calls to very many people because I just know that I don\u2019t always have so many wonderful things to say, except that I\u2019m in a lot of pain. That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve been feeling lately. So when <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F3\">I was talking to my mom, she said How was your day or something and I said, I\u2019m in a lot of pain, it\u2019s really not a great day and I said I was trying to get a hold of dad, to ask my father a question about something and she said, she said, I don\u2019t really want to hear about your pain she said, you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F4\">your girlfriend to talk to about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2013E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">CLIENT: And I was like, you are a bitch. That was the word that came to my mind. And I was like this! And I said, ok, have a good night \u2013 see you later. So that was what you know, really, thanks for the unconditional care, because I don\u2019t really say it to her that much and so that was, that has nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201411\">to do with this boy and yet you know there\u2019s a part of me that feels I was still unconditionally accepting him despite, despite his poor behavior, and I made that very clear to him, but I think because it\u2019s something again that\u2019s still new, it\u2019s even for myself. I\u2019m a little bit more inclined to say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201412\">Oh, your father\u2019s in town, and you don\u2019t see him very often and it must be really hard, you just threw a table but you know, that must be really hard. And now I\u2019m seeing the effects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">THERAPIST: How would THAT help him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">CLIENT: It wouldn\u2019t. It would not. And I don\u2019t generally tend to do that and children don\u2019t generally tend to pick up tables in my office either. This happened to be a more unique situation today. But, it was a challenge for me to learn how to approach it, because I know that I\u2019m his guidance counselor <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201451\">and I know that I\u2019m there to help him with his feelings but at the same time I know that that behavior is inappropriate and makes other people feel, it creates an unsettling feeling with other children in the room. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">THERAPIST: Right. Didn\u2019t you handle it well in retrospect?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">CLIENT: I think so, I do, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Did you handle it in a bitchy way? Get clear here about your self-evaluation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">THERAPIST: And yet, your self-evaluation to me said unthinkingly minutes ago almost was, \u201cOh, I\u2019m like a bitch, my tolerance is low, my frustration tolerance is low\u201d. I think that the way you said you handled it, sounds like a very healthy appropriate way to handle it. The reason I\u2019m stopping on this <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F1\">situation is to have you see how quickly you evaluated yourself negatively, and inaccurately. With awareness can come change. Also, the nature of your mother\u2019s response to you on the phone does not, it seems to me, seem similar to the way you responded to the boy today. Does it? You indicated that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F2\">wanted to say to her \u201cyou\u2019re a bitch\u201d after she told you to tell your girlfriends about your pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2014E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">CLIENT: I did say it, I went like that (gestures).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">THERAPIST: She can\u2019t see you give her the finger over the phone. I see you do it here, but she couldn\u2019t see it. But you expressed for yourself. You were likening your behavior today, to that of your mother\u2019s, calling the behavior of your mother \u201cbitch\u201d-like and saying that you were acting like a bitch <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201531\">with the boy. But now, as we stop and observe, as we reflect back: Did you behave like a bitch towards the boy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">CLIENT: No, I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">THERAPIST: Right. Ok, so notice how quickly you did that, and the reason I point that out is not to reprimand you, but to have you stop , to watch your thinking and irrational ideas therein \u2013 and if you\u2019re willing to continue to be watchful and to catch yourself if you are being cruel to yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201571\">then you have an opportunity to stop it. Make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">THERAPIST: See how you were being kinder to the boy than you have tended to be towards yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">CLIENT: Kinder to him? I don\u2019t know that I was kind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Alright, let\u2019s use the word appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20163\">THERAPIST: See, how you were more appropriate with him than you are to yourself when you call yourself a bitch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20165\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20167\">THERAPIST: So how about a little democracy here when we\u2019re able to use it? Make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20169\">CLIENT: (laughing) You\u2019re a character. Yes it does. You make me laugh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Good! Good! I hope you can at times appropriately make yourself laugh about the foibles of human nature and our tendencies. (laughing in background) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016D\">THERAPIST: So back to homework, which, I\u2019m not getting a clear message about whether you did it or didn\u2019t do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016F\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t do it; I didn\u2019t do it (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20171\">THERAPIST: I thought I that you said that you did one part of it, and watched the video of you as a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20173\">CLIENT: Oh that part. My time has really been usurped with just basically getting up, going to work and coming back and doing a lot of research for, I\u2019ve been researching surgeons, I\u2019ve been researching and so not to say that I didn\u2019t have time, because I\u2019m sure that that we can always find time, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201731\">I really did not, I\u2019m being completely honest, I didn\u2019t sit down to do it. I\u2019ve been just trying to remind myself. I\u2019ve been using the, I have you in my head and I have the different thoughts that I have and I\u2019m trying to stop and think and I was doing it at work today. Even after the kid left, I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201732\">because the \u201cshould\u201d started creeping in so I said, Jessa, sit down, reflect, so I mean, if that you know is, which I do all the time, but I think I REALLY calmed myself to do it today, with this particular situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20175\">THERAPIST: I think you did very well today. And yes it\u2019s very good to think more and contemplate more and reflect more and catch the \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d, to use the more accurate language. So that\u2019s one thing and well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20177\">CLIENT: But I did not sit down to do the homework, and I beat myself up about it too, that I knew I was seeing you tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20179\">THERAPIST: How does that help, to beat yourself up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017B\">CLIENT: Um, it doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017D\">THERAPIST: What were you telling yourself in terms of beating yourself up? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F\">CLIENT: Oh, my goodness it\u2019s a lot. Jessa, I told myself, you didn\u2019t do the homework, and I have a session with Debbie tonight. That was really lazy, you had time even though you were looking for surgeons, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d use the word lazy with myself, I said you are avoiding, that\u2019s what I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2017F1\">saying. And then I was saying I can\u2019t believe that you did that. Other people would have had the homework done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2017E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2017E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">THERAPIST: Other people, the royal superiors; meaning everyone else but you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah, everybody else but me would have had it done, Debbie\u2019s not going to be happy with you, she\u2019s<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20185\">THERAPIST: (In exaggerated and joking form) Oh no!

I said it\u2019s late, why would you<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20191\">THERAPIST: You got angry? NO. You made yourself angry , because you were thinking what ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20193\">CLIENT: Because I was thinking that I made this time for us tonight but that there really wasn\u2019t a lot of, oh because that was the other thought that I had. I said to myself Jessa you asked Debbie for a session soon, to do it now before the next time because you needed it and then I thought how selfish <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201931\">that you know you were wasting time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20195\">THERAPIST: Hmm. I\u2019ve just heard all of this self damning talk, but a few of the comments may have been accurate.  Some of what you thought is descriptive. You could say to yourself that\u2019s not a self damning comment. It\u2019s actually accurate; but then when you put in the other ones, those that then lead <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201951\">to your feeling guilt or shame and all that. They are self damning. Why do that to yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20197\">CLIENT: Punishment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20199\">THERAPIST: Well yes. Unconditional self-acceptance doesn\u2019t mean allowing yourself to work against your interests and be a lazy one at catching yourself thinking in harmful ways. That\u2019s not the goal of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019B\">CLIENT: No, I feel like it actually probably does the opposite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Unconditional self-acceptance<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like it probably encourages you to be less of that, because if you\u2019re sitting there and you\u2019re beating yourself up, chances are you\u2019re doing the, it\u2019s the self-fulfilling prophecy and then you\u2019re gonna screw up even more, in some way. You may not screw it up to the outside world, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F1\">but eventually that\u2019s going to catch up to you and you\u2019re going to screw it up another way. So,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s highly probable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">CLIENT: I think you become a more effective person when you don\u2019t self-damn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">THERAPIST: When you said become a more effective person, a preferable way of expressing that is that one can function more effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Remember, not to confuse your worth with your performance, good or bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB\">CLIENT: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">THERAPIST: So, you\u2019re still a worth-while human despite the fact that you didn\u2019t do what you committed to do.

I think I\u2019ve been a little overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D7\">THERAPIST: But you told me a few minutes ago, that you probably could have done it if you set your mind to it. So what did you possibly, probably tell yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D9\">CLIENT: I really just told myself I wasn\u2019t I really haven\u2019t been feeling well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DB\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t feel like it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DD\">CLIENT: No, didn\u2019t feel well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DF\">THERAPIST: But you still did the research for the surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E1\">CLIENT: Well because I feel like my, that\u2019s where my<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E3\">THERAPIST: priorities -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E5\">CLIENT: priorities are, right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E7\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m not disputing the value of researching doctors and the like that right now. If it had to be either or, I think you were wise to choose researching your medical issues. My question is was it really an either\/or? Or could you not have done, even imperfectly for 10 minutes, a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E71\">bit of the ABC form? Could you not have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E9\">CLIENT: Oh, I guess I could have. I just thought we had said a \u00bd an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB\">THERAPIST: So there was that need to do it perfectly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201ED\">CLIENT: Perfectly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Perfectly or close to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Ok, so the good news is, I\u2019m going to suggest that you do that homework again, and see how you go. Either you are going to do it, or, if you don\u2019t do it, it will be interesting to hear what excuses you\u2019ll come up with then. (laughing) This is time for you to deepen your acceptance of yourself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201F11\">your awareness of yourself, which clearly you\u2019re making progress with. To enhance your life and the first clear stated goal, way back when we started, was around the anxiety issue, but this approach applies to many other issues as you\u2019ll discover. Now, was there any anxiety you felt in recent days?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N201F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201F3\">CLIENT: LOTS!

What did you do in the early hours of the morning when instead of sleeping, which you tell yourself you should be doing, you are awake and uncomfortable \u2026 and I\u2019m not meaning to sound like I\u2019m trivializing your pain. I do know it is very difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20207\">CLIENT: That\u2019s good, because my mom trivialized it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20209\">THERAPIST: If that is so, let us for now leave discussing that. I\u2019ve acknowledged you before, for your courage and carrying on as you endure intense physical pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2020B\">CLIENT: Intense way beyond belief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2020D\">THERAPIST: I believe you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2020F\">CLIENT: Alright, I\u2019m glad you do.

That has good dramatic affect. (both laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20217\">CLIENT: But people DON\u2019T know what they see. Sometimes, not all the times, but sometimes I think that when people see an image, it\u2019s confusing because you know, I do put myself together well for the most part, that\u2019s what actually keeps me going throughout the day. Well I say I have a nice outfit, pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202171\">jewelry, my makeup is on, but I feel like crap!

NO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2021F\">CLIENT: But any way, why did I bring that up? OH! because I was really having a hard time settling in and then I started in with telling myself: you should be asleep, you need 7 hours, you need 8 hours, if you don\u2019t get 8 hours your gonna be a mess, if you\u2019re a mess this is what\u2019s gonna happen and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2021F1\">was like the next and the next until I did lie there till three a.m. I eventually was able to sort of self soothe I guess, and I don\u2019t remember what I was telling myself, because it was a long time of the worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20221\">THERAPIST: What might it have been that you told yourself to self-soothe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20223\">CLIENT: You will eventually fall asleep because you\u2019ll be really, really tired, what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20225\">THERAPIST: Good, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20227\">CLIENT: I was you know, so you\u2019ll lose a little bit of sleep, you\u2019re not going to die, you know, the walls aren\u2019t going to come crashing down. What I actually did do was I put on an inspirational video, just because I was lying in bed, so I wasn\u2019t going to get up and do anything, so big and significant <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202271\">like run a marathon, but I put on a video that I would like to share with you at some point just because the girl in it she was one of my students actually who just recently passed away in July of cancer, she was so positive, so spunky, just had such a way of being positive she would be a really <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202272\">good if she had survived and carried on with her life, I feel like she encouraged a lot of people to be inspirational too and despite what you\u2019re feeling, physically or whatever it is to carry on and so I put her video on. I watched her \u2013 it was about a 10 minute video and I felt her with me and I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202273\">like that\u2019s it, I said to her, \u201cyou\u2019re amazing\u201d, and then I fell asleep so I don\u2019t remember anything after that till I woke up.  So I feel that a part of that had to do with everything, I\u2019m sort of, because I was able to really listen to what she was really saying as opposed to just watching this cute <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202274\">little bubbly girl and saying oh she\u2019s so bubbly, she\u2019s so great, I really heard her in what she was saying and the things she was saying and she was expressing like ok I got basically a death sentence from the Dr.\u2019s. They told her she had such sentence from the cancer, and she said But I\u2019m not listening <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202275\">to those Dr.\u2019s she said, I\u2019m still here and she was, oh she\u2019s adorable, so, it was really, really inspirational for me to watch that at that moment. And also to know that she suffered from some really serious physical pain which no child needs to go through.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20226-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20226-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20229\">THERAPIST: Yes.

So I will be a bit tired, I will be a bit weary. Then you watched an inspirational video which, one of the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2022D1\">it possibly did, was remind you, as you mentioned a few months ago, it could be worse, you were in pain, but so was she and yet, not only is she a great model for you, in terms of carrying on regardless, but you don\u2019t have that same illness. You have an issue that\u2019s in all probability can be helped <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2022D2\">to some degree.

(both women exclaiming)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2024F\">CLIENT: I did, because I realized, I said, that was, I don\u2019t have dreams like that normally and it was boom, boom, right in my arm two booms right in the arm, I mean right in the shoulder where I had the surgery and I got up and I said alright, I\u2019m not happy about this and it\u2019s not the best thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2024F1\">but I\u2019m gonna get up and stand up anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20251\">THERAPIST: Well ! I can understand why you would want to sleep more often, you are very rational in your dreams!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20253\">(laughing) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20255\">CLIENT: It just reminded me when you said that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20257\">THERAPIST: Very good, very good. Well done Jessa. Time moving, we\u2019re winding down now, we\u2019ve only got a few more minutes for our session. I would just like to share something with you. Disclose something with you in relation to what we\u2019re talking about and about the importance of maintaining a healthy <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202571\">perspective, and then let\u2019s talk about homework that you will or won\u2019t do (laughing) before we next meet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20259\">There no doubt is a biological reason for why humans do better with a certain amount of sleep. I mean it\u2019s a provable scientific fact that there are circadian rhythms and so forth. On the other hand, humans are very resilient, we\u2019re very adaptable. We can go through traumatic times and recover and heal <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202591\">and start again in a healthy way, and what can hold us back from recovering more quickly is catastrophizing, and what can make times that are filled with traumatic situations easier is keeping a healthy perspective. So, my personal disclosure, that I want to share with you is the fact that for the last <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202592\">15 months of my husband\u2019s life he was in hospital, and then rehab with a hope of getting better and going home, but then there would be a relapse and it was back to hospital and then back to rehab, and so it was for 15 months it was in and out of hospital and rehab, and then only as he was dying in <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202593\">his final weeks did we get to go home, because I didn\u2019t want him in a hospital environment in the end. And so wherever he was, so was I. So when he was in a hospital they let me set up a cot next to him, I would sleep there. Sleep: Hardly. And then when he was in rehab there was in his room a recliner <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202594\">chair that became my bed. I\u2019m highly sensitive to noise, a light sleeper, and was aware of people around us in that place, and very much attuned to my beloved husband and what he was feeling and going through. And so for 15 months I doubt that there was even one night in which I got more than 45 minutes <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202595\">sleep before being woken up. By a nurse coming in, by Al\u2019s saying \u201cwater, water\u201d, or groaning in pain. And if there was something I could do, I would get up and do it. I might get up and stroke Al\u2019s head till he seemed to relax. Then I would just allow myself to just go back to sleep. Al was in a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202596\">of pain, I mean really most of the time. And I would get up and I would stand by his hospital bed and he would love his head being just gently touched and stroked and I would do that and sometimes I would fall asleep, literally standing up. I don\u2019t know if it was for five seconds or five minutes, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202597\">I would wake up and there I was, with my hand kind of on his head, I had been asleep. Standing. It appears that my brain was forcing me to sleep. Or could no longer keep me awake. My point being, for a very long period of time, I didn\u2019t get enough sleep. And I survived, I got by. It may have affected <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202598\">short term memory awhile, but not in any significant way. At times from sleep deprivation I was probably a little foggy, but I got by. Now before that had happened, if any had said to me: \u201cyou know, I\u2019m a psychic and for the next year and a half you will get hardly ANY sleep\u201d, I could have easily created <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202599\">anxiety within myself thinking it was going to kill me. I am telling you this six and \u00bd years after the fact. So there have been no apparent long term consequences.  If there were, I would probably know them by now. So, I shared this with you to give you the message that we humans are resilient (and <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2025910\">I could give you very many other examples of people in more dire straits than I was in). My situation was not exceptional. It was damn hard. A lot of people don\u2019t go through such hardships, but a lot of people do go through such dire events and worse. My point being for you, in the context of what we <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N2025911\">were talking about, that we can handle a lot, we humans, and if we tell ourselves we can\u2019t and when we think in awfulizing ways, then we really limit our enjoyment and capacity to cope with hardship, and we are telling ourselves something that usually is false anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N20258-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20258-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2025B\">CLIENT: And thank you for sharing that because it, it\u2019s, I mean it was a nice picture for me to see in many ways about the sleep but also to just hear about Al and also somebody who I know, you know, to see him as human in a way I guess, even though he did, obviously he was the one who came up, devised <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N2025B1\">this whole concept of REBT, but you know he, he was human as well and, and had experienced pain and physical pain you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2025D\">THERAPIST: Oh, very intense and agonizing physical pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2025F\">CLIENT: And I understand that and I think right now, maybe pain looks different for everybody but you know pain has been a part of my life for months and months without a break from it really, without really saying oh I feel great, you know so, It\u2019s really just interesting how you were able to sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N2025F1\">of able to keep things in perspective because he was the patient but you, I don\u2019t think people always take into consideration the one whose caring. No, no, no I mean I am saying it in a way that it makes it, it makes me, and it makes it easier for me not to beat myself up so much that I am in pain. <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N2025F2\">I\u2019m in pain that\u2019s not fun, nobody wants to be in, yeah but I know, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being clear, but it\u2019s clear in my head and I\u2019m gonna use it and also with what you said about the sleep that you survived it, that was whole point of your story, was that nothing so bad happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P17-N2025E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"16\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2025E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":18,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561798\" data-realpage=\"18\" data-page=\"18\">\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20261\">THERAPIST: Worst case, you\u2019re foggy the next day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20263\">CLIENT: Well that was what happened, because sleeping from 3 a.m. to you know 7 is not a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20265\">THERAPIST: It is probably not life threatening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20267\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not life threatening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20269\">THERAPIST: Unless you walk in front of a bus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2026B\">CLIENT: Then of course it is! Yes, I think the funny thing is though that the body, and know we are wrapping it up nowend of session but the body does have a way, if somebody goes for like a day or so, your body can just sleep, like you don\u2019t, like I\u2019ve had the thoughts before, oh if you don\u2019t sleep, <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N2026B1\">then what happens if it\u2019s like two days and then three days but I think you sometimes, just, you are human like you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2026D\">THERAPIST: There are mothers who have screaming, crying babies, who also get extremely little sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2026F\">CLIENT: Exactly! That\u2019s what I thought!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20271\">THERAPIST: So anyway, you did well,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20273\">CLIENT: Thank you. Sorry, I\u2019m getting tired myself now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20275\">THERAPIST: No, no need to apologize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20277\">CLIENT: But thank you for sharing, I appreciate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20279\">THERAPIST: Alright, no problem and in Al\u2019s biography and in a few of his books, you can read that he was very ill and in pain throughout his life, but he did not catastrophize about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2027B\">CLIENT: Yeah I know, I read that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2027D\">THERAPIST: One of the issues was he would have debilitating headaches especially as a boy and teenager, and young man. Before he was diagnosed as a diabetic he probably had issues that contributed to migraine, and sometimes as many migrainesufferers share, the pain is so intense they want to die. <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N2027D1\">I mean they think in those moments that they would rather die than bear the pain. The good news is that core part of the carries on because they remind themselves that the pain will pass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2027F\">CLIENT: Exactly! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20281\">THERAPIST: And let\u2019s not forget that persistence which you\u2019ve been practicing. Jessa . I think it\u2019s an easy question, but what do you think would be good homework for you to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20283\">CLIENT: The homework I didn\u2019t do before!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20285\">THERAPIST: That might be a good idea.
