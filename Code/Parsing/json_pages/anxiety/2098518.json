I rush to Dunkin, I run to my friend who, like I can't just, I gotta at least chat with him briefly, so like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">fuck, fuck, fuck.

Like maybe that's part of psychoanalysis or whatever, but, maybe I'm at that part where I'm like it's not causing me more anxiety in a way? But it is causing me more, like I don't know what I'm supposed to talk about, or I feel like, oh, there's deep things I'm not getting at, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">or I don't know.

I think that was kind of technically, like today, usually I have like three alarms that, you know. So, because there was really no alarm, I just, once I get into that deep sleep it was just, I woke up right at like one. Although I did wake up with a start. I mean I suddenly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">remembered and then I woke up all panicky and I was like, fuck me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: But you also didn't set your alarm which is important, so even the night before (cross talk) (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, well the night before was kind of a weird, it was an unusual night. I don't think it was I really think I just forgot, like I had a little too much to drink. I mean I was fine, but I was, for a Monday night I don't do that very often. I was a little buzzed. This chick tried to kiss me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">twice and that threw me off a little bit. I resisted. That was never happened in my life I mean unless they're disgusting and I'm not attracted, but an attractive girl, like I fended her off. It was pretty awesome, I thought. But, and then I went to see Dave. I didn't drink at Dave's, but we had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">like a long talk. We hung out. It was nice but didn't get home til like 4:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: This was Tuesday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I'm sorry, Tuesday night See?

(cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I think it was a build up to an excuse, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Um hmm. The mind is tricky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I've been getting more headaches lately, too. I used to get chronic headaches, really bad ones back in, between \u201899 and 2001. You know, one of those cluster kind of ones that are right here. And that's been happening not every day, not so bad but, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Like migraines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I don't quite think they're, I mean I don't throw up, or I don't, but yeah they're on that, yeah, they're similar. I mean my eyes get a little sensitive to light. I just feel kind of wacky and stuff. And again, I think it's just because there's so much, I don't know. And a lot of it's good, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">that's the thing, but it's just a lot, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">(Pause): [00:06:45 00:06:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I was thinking yesterday when I was thinking about it, it was like, god, maybe I'm not even prepared, or maybe I need to work on being okay. I mean that sounds simplistic, but even like physically, like do you know what I mean, if you don't know what it's like to be like, \u2018oh, wow, I guess things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">are pretty good,' but I don't know if they're good today I guess they were good yesterday.

Yeah, I think I definitely feel anxious and nervous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Do you know about what you think of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Well, unfortunately, I think sometimes like it's, sometimes it's getting to feel like because now there's so much on my mind, this is almost starting to feel like one of those things. I mean it's hard to explain. Like I want to be here, but then it's something like, \u2018wow, it's another thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">I've got to do' and like it's psychoanalysis so I can't and there's nothing I really can complain about per se. it's not like before where it's like, \u2018oh, today this happened.' You know what I mean? So, maybe it's just, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Where it feels a little bit more like it's like a drag, or is it something you have to check off the list kind of in your day? As opposed to ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Well no, not that bad. Not that bad. But it's like other things on my mind. It's more kind of anxiety producing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Um hmm. Instead of the place where it used to just be, \u2018okay, I'll go there and I'll feel better.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Or, it's scary like, or what if like, \u2018man, if I don't feel better here, like, it's like I'm fucked.' Like, no wonder my head starts hurting. Then you feel like, \u2018Jesus, this used to be the place I come to and then I leave and I feel better.' But, lately I just feel like I'm so on edge, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">mentally on edge that it's just hard, you know.

I'm worried because I'm still, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C71\">like I feel like I'm doing all the things, and I'm feeling the way I wish I would have felt when I was 30 or 25, you know? So, I'm a little worried that like that part of me isn't going to want to settle. Do you know what I mean? Even in a (inaudible). You're in like the prime. Chicks are into you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C72\">You're doing shit. Things are happening. Like you're really living now. So, why are you settling for do you know what I mean? There's like a voice like that, or that's just scared that, \u2018yeah, I do really, really care about this person, but that I'm weak because of this deep feeling that, that some <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C73\">amazing girl, if some other amazing girl came my way it would be hard for me to resist. I don't know. Like, do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I do. And it, there's some, the feeling that if only, god, if you'd felt this way about yourself when you 20 ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: ...what then, what would be the possibilities then.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098518\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. By now I probably would have like had kids, you know. Because I would have been able to, I would have felt more okay about committing long term because, you know. But, yeah, I just worry that like it's like, I mean. That girl, my friend who tried to kiss me, like it wasn't completely her <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">fault. I mean, I'm a flirt, man. You know like I wasn't going to do anything, but that started it, like man I just can't help it. I cannot help it. You know? I just love that feeling of knowing that, you know, I could have this person, you know. Because I'm trying to make up for years of feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF2\">a fucking loser and hating myself and, you know, just. I don't know, it just worries me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Also to the degree that the feeling that you still have to prove it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: ...there means there's still some (cross talk) (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: That still there is a kernel of it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: ...there's still work to be done and to understand...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Because, in other words, there must still be some feeling which, of course, how could there not be, in a way when we're just scratching the surface...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: ...that you're not quite sure: are you or are you not worth this person somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So, maybe there's a part that it feels like, \u2018well,' I mean ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">(Pause): [00:16:24 00:16:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Or it is that there's a part of me that's like, \u2018ay, you know.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">(Pause): [00:16:51 00:16:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Like (Pause) Yeah, it's serious but, you know, would it be a big deal if I saw somebody else like I mean, if you see someone once a week and you're just ti I don't know, like my mind is playing tricks on me like with that stuff, ya know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: You know I wonder, Brian (sp?) about whether there's something, there's something that seems like is happening here and also happening with Kelly. The way you're talking about her and I was just thinking about how you were just talking about this place, like \u2018ay, you know,' like it's becoming, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">rather than being really important, that something's happening where I almost get the feeling that it's just one of those things or what's the big deal if I did something else? What's the big deal if I slept in. You know? That with her there is also, there is some pulling back going on inside you and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF2\">is not totally clear why, but there may be something about, like if the next step was being more intimate and more vulnerable here or there in different ways...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's scary. It makes me anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Terrifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Lying on a couch is not and taking the relationship you have with Kelly to it's going really well and to have it continue being well and deepened is really new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Um hmm.

It means that the essence of what's going on inside starts to get brought here more and more and more. Your functioning is going a lot better. But like everything's foreign, I mean outside, and now you actually then begin the get steps of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF2\">what happens when you're still in yourself. What comes up and that's what would come up here. It doesn't really happen that much out there and it's good that it's here.

It's at the manufacturer as we speak. I did that event. It went super well. Even little things like I got the DVD and I couldn't figure out how to just save it as a file on my laptop so I could send it to my you know it like took two fuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F1\">I just couldn't figure out, for some reason on Google, it wasn't super clear, whatever sites I found. So even that, like it was like I didn't give up. Like for two or three days I kept trying, I kept trying and I figured it out, you know. And, not only that I like edited it, so I made an edit for <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F2\">my publisher that's just me reading so it's not the whole hour and a half of chitchat, you know. That's like a little thing, but it's not. Yeah, that's huge. Or like I got my thing from the loan, like you know in 15 days they're going to consolidate all the loans and even now, I have to call them because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F3\">the monthly payment is ridiculous. I don't know what's going on there. The whole point was that, whatever, I think that can be totally sorted out, but like all that stuff, you know what I mean. The record release, show, I'm starting two businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: You are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: I'm starting two fucking businesses, yeah. One of them with my friend from the magazine. So, yeah, she's always had this idea to do a tee shirt business where it's you know that artist, Jenny Holzer, you know, just those sayings? We're going to come up with things like that. We'll just have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">really cool, nice cotton, form fitted, stylish tee shirts maybe with a very simple, some kind of thing and sell them. Have like a nice online source for that. But my other big thing is I'm always talking about clothing, right? So, I'm starting an online high end boutique for ties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Humph!

Like there are like big places like \u2018shit load of ties,' or whatever, but like really a cool, like high end web site like I'm into fashion, whatever. So, like, the thing about that is that in the past I might have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201231\">thought about that, but now like I have a whole file of wholesalers and I already looked up prices and that in of itself makes me anxious. Do you know what I mean? The fact that I'm doing these things is like unnerving me, like it's making me feel weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: That's almost not you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I think I have a fantasy that if I lay down suddenly it's going to be something awesome, you know, but it's not like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">THERAPIST: Some awesome what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: It's that some awesome things are going to get speeded up and it's going to be, like I'll feel a lot better and less anxious or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: If that's the only fantasy you'd have of it, I don't know that you would not do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: Well, well, yeah, plus, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's the other stuff, too, but I don't know what I'm saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Oh, but maybe even that, you're saying even if you did speed up and it got better and better and better, that's very disconcerting already.

So, that my reading of them I noticed <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C71\">just very, a lot of confidence, like the diction, the way I was like just calm, like it was just perfect.
