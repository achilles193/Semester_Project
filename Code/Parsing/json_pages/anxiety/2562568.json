It looks like it is just raining now. (sigh) I woke up at six-thirty, I was at the cafe at eight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Wow!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Finished the blog post by ten-thirty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I wrote a pretty good blog. I mean, I hope they like it but I wrote a blog post about pretty much my favorite poet for the website. I didn\u2019t really get into any analysis. It ended up just being like a, you know, my teenage year or two when I discovered this guy. Coming to the Square and hanging <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">out at all the used book stores for hours and hours. You know, whatever. I hope they like it. I don\u2019t know. I like it. I don\u2019t care if they like it. But, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT\u201d Yeah, so yeah, so it was cool. It was kind of weird too. I didn\u2019t even struggle much. I just wrote it. I didn\u2019t over think it. I like it and I hope they like it. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really care. It came out nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And then I told Chuck, I told my former professor, my supervisor at UConn about you writing the letter. And he was like, I think he was like, \u201cThat is all we need.\u201d (laughs) He is like, \u201cThat should be more than enough.\u201d I was like, \u201cI guess I could get a death certificate.\u201d I said, \u201cI said I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">really like to avoid having to do that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">He is like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. That should be more than enough.\u201d So I guess what I will do is maybe get you whoever it has to be addressed to if that is okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. And also if there is anything more specific about what they need it to say. Does it have to say, \u201cCouldn\u2019t be enrolled.\u201d Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it basically has to show that there, in your medical opinion, there are clear reasons why I wasn\u2019t able to just consistently see it through and had to drop out or whatever happened. Or that I couldn\u2019t register. But I can find out though more if there is something specific, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">wording or whatever. Yeah. But that is pretty cool. It makes it a lot easier. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So, yeah, pretty good. (pause) Yeah, it is very interesting how it has just been a getting shit done kind of week. So different from You know, like yesterday I changed my light bulb in my car. I changed the windshield wipers. These are such little things but it has just been a lot of these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">little thing, you know, throughout. I am just checking things off, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">And some big things. I mean, getting an airline ticket and this, whatever, UConn. Pretty good. I am even kind of excited and hopeful now about going to Assyria. Not too excited and hopeful (laughs) but excited and hopeful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Ordinary excitement and ordinary hopefulness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What do you make of getting so much done all of a sudden?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I think last week, like I said, that was just a major, you know. You know what it is like? What was it two Septembers ago or whatever? When I just had that volcanic eruption at my Mom. That was with my Mom. And I think this one was with the whole family. They clearly don\u2019t get that, of course. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">But for me, something in me just shut down in a good way. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">It is like a river that the water is being directed a certain way but it is being wasted. You know? Now that that is shut down it is being channeled properly. You know? Yeah. I just, I don\u2019t know. So like now my Mom, she is complaining or whatever, if she sounds like, \u201cblah,\u201d you know. I just kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">don\u2019t care. That part of me is shut down. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562568\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Now the only thing that sucks is I also have nothing to say to her. I feel bad kind of. Like I am suddenly just not even sharing certain things. But, you know, I even thought about that. I was like, \u201cOh, I kind of hate that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Well who would? I live there? Do you know what I mean? It is different when you don\u2019t live in the same building. You don\u2019t see each other that often. You don\u2019t talk that often. So then of course you have things to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:05:41) and catch up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, you kind of want to catch up and you kind of enjoy it and you know you are going to be out of there. But when you live above your parents, I mean, what the fuck is there to talk about? It is just, it is too much. It has served its purpose but You know? So, yeah, I think that is what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">happened. I just think once that part, you know, got shut off all this other stuff got reenergized and focused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: It is funny because I was writing this thing and it is supposed to be 500 to 600 words, right? So at the beginning I was like, \u201cOh, 80 words.\u201d Then I just stopped. I don\u2019t know what happened. It wasn\u2019t even conscious. I just stopped looking at the word count and I just didn\u2019t care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">And the next thing I knew it was like 780 words. You know? I don\u2019t know. I think I just kind of don\u2019t care anymore. I don\u2019t care if sounds academic or this kind of analysis of that. (laughs) I am just going to write about it the way I want to write about it. You know? I am not a moron. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Whereas, in the past I am like, \u201cOh, I am an idiot. What is the insight of these poems. I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know how to talk about them. Mm.\u201d Fuck that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: It is like trusting more in your own mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, why do I have to sound like some academic? I don\u2019t want to sound like that. Part of me envies, but it is like envying anything. It is like saying, \u201cWow, Claire, is such a good \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean I want to be a psychologist. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, just because I am a writer doesn\u2019t mean I am going to write every genre of writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Who the fuck gives a shit. I don\u2019t want to. I envy others who write amazing academic papers that are But I don\u2019t want to do that. Who reads their papers anyway? Nobody. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So it is like, what am I I am all caught up in something that is just ridiculous. So. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: As opposed to being yourself and letting out what comes from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. That is all. Yeah. That is it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Whatever style that comes out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Trusting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well and also, not only trusting but being like, \u201cWhat?\u201d It is like, I mean I am not comparing myself to any great writer but it is like a really good writer who is like, \u201cOh, geez. Well, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I wrote this great collection of short stories but could I really write a history <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">of Darien.\u201d Like what the? Who cares?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Those people want to write these short stories. Don\u2019t worry about that. Just do what you do. So. (pause) I wrote an e-mail to London, to the registrar. I was like, \u201cLook, I was a student done with all the course work. I just need to reregister and finish my dissertation. You know, this guy is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">my supervisor,\u201d blah, blah. You know, \u201cWe just want to know how to proceed.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562568\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: It sounds like in part it becomes clear that those things are really what you want, as opposed to doing something that someone else wants you to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Like as opposed to the Brown thing. I don\u2019t have any interest really in going back, finishing. But these two things are in my field, they are with people and professors I care about who have been good to me. You know? So I just want to see it through. And obviously it will <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">help me professionally. Especially when you are that close. They are both about handing in your final piece. So. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: And they both will help you with what you want to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Not what someone else wants you to do. But what you are increasingly (ph) wanting to do yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It is even good in the sense that like today at the cafe I was feeling a little bit like restless energy. Like kind of antsy and a little bit (takes a breath). But I am able to catch that and be like, \u201cWell, you are going to feel that way because now you are doing things.\u201d It is called energy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">and adrenaline or whatever you want to call it. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">So it is like you\u2019re up at fucking You are at a cafe at eight a.m. And you are writing and you are focused. And it is just a little bit You know, like I am even just instead of saying it is unnerving or it is rattling it is just, I don\u2019t know, whatever you want to call it, just living or just being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">very productive. And when you are very productive you feel a certain energy. (pause, tapping sounds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">It helps to call it something different. You know what I mean? Instead of calling it negative things. Well if that is the case I am always going to feel rattled and unnerved. I mean, if you are going to be doing things and feeling that way you have got to change how you view what that feeling is. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">know? It is the feeling of someone not familiar with those feelings. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (laughs) Like feeling awake, period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It is filled with lots of pulsing energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Right. Possibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It could even be hard to sit still -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: because there is so much energy. And writing, you have to sort of own (ph) that and focus it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: But that is a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is like, you know, it is just like the physical sensations they change. Do you know what I mean? Like I feel more tingly and, do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: And even that I have to be like, \u201cAlright. Well, that is, yeah, because you got up at a different hour. You are up and about doing shit. You are hopeful and excited about stuff. You are \u201c You know? A lot of possibilities and this and that. Of course, if you are not used to that kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">But you are also trying to temper it. You know what it is? It is hard to know what is normal in a way. I am always very hyper vigilant about that. You know, I don\u2019t want to go either extreme. So for the time being I feel like I have to be a little hyper vigilant about that until, I guess, I don\u2019t think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">about it anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562568\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: You know, Brian, the things you are doing do not sound Like you don\u2019t sound hypo-manic, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201chyper vigilant\u201d to there being too much about it, for example, it sounds like this is what it feels like when your body starts to become more alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, I just mean hyper vigilant just because I am not used to any of this. I am kind of like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: So hyper vigilant to what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Just making sure that it stays the way it is. (laughs) That I don\u2019t go to any extremes. I mean, I am not that type anyway, I guess. I don\u2019t have that in my history to become manic or this or that. Right? I don\u2019t think so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah, when I use that word it loosely using as a kind of in a personality defense way. Not, you do not have bipolar disorder. You have never had bipolar disorder, for example. Like true mania, that is not you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: People can have manic defenses though where it is a kind of retreated place into a kind of grandiose fantasy place that protects them from deficits in self-esteem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: That is different than a formal Axis I disorder. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Right, right. Yeah, it is different than what Terry used to do. Like cleaning your apartment at three a.m. or doing different projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That has never been you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, yeah, I see what you are saying. What you are describing is true. And, yeah, and I am not doing that. I am not doing that. So I guess what I am saying about hyper vigilant is staying in this healthy It just feels good and I worked too hard to get here. So I feel like until it becomes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">second nature, which maybe it already has. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">Maybe I am over thinking it a little bit. But I can\u2019t help it. I am just like, \u201cAlright.\u201d This feels good. I feel even keel somehow, whatever. I got to this point. (laughs) So I am just kind of like, \u201cOkay.\u201d It is almost like checking in with myself. You know, like, \u201cOh, yeah. I am still even keel. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">Alright. Great. Keep going.\u201d I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I just don\u2019t think you can go backwards from here. You have done too much. It is in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: In other words, once you know what know about the manic defense you can\u2019t make it unconscious again. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: That is true. Yeah. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: It might be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Once you open that door you can\u2019t just That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: You might wish you could know less because ignorance is bliss sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I mean it could go there for five minutes or an hour or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: But you know too much about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, that is true. Like with music, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: That is just done. Like now it just seems like a healthy Like I am always going to do music. I am always going to take it seriously. But who know what that means? Do you know what I mean? It doesn\u2019t mean necessarily I am going to tour or do this or do that.

Right. And then what happens is Like today she called me in the morning, she is worried, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d You know. But, dude, what the? I have stuff to do. And she is so concerned about the weather. It is like, how? We are from here. I mean. It is like that is not really helping anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F1\">You are just annoying the shit out of me.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: See I think even deeper still than saying, \u201cOkay, they are old, they are stuck, they are not going to change now,\u201d is your recognition in yourself that you don\u2019t need to take care of her anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: In other words -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: Or feel guilty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: Or feel guilty if you don\u2019t. I think that has been so sewn into the fabric of the relationship with her in ways that are still coming to light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: That you haven\u2019t even realized how much you have been doing that since you were a child. Like her call, \u201cI am worried about you in snow.\u201d What is happening in that phone call is you are taking care of her, not the opposite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: And now you imagine that anxiety, that neurosis, that stuff getting played out in a five year old and a ten year old. When you are actually a kid still, I imagine. And she is turning to you in ways to work out things that are about taking care of her mind. So you have been so pulled into that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">You have talked about this. I mean, this is the dynamic of your relationships with women for a very long time. Getting to know them. Helping them, their minds. And you are hidden. And I think this is sort of another layer of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need to do that anymore.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: Right. Right. And the unfortunate thing is they are all like that. So it wasn\u2019t like, well at least I have my other aunts and uncles who are like, \u201cCome on, Ginny, don\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: They are all in some ways worse and in some ways not worse, but they are all I mean, my uncle is like Between him and his wife he is the one that smothers his children. I have told you before. Like he used to be up all night ironing their shit and this. And it is like, \u201cDude, what the? Tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201891\">them to iron their own shit and take out the garbage. What is the matter with you?\u201d You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20188-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20188-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562568\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">I don\u2019t know what it is. It is just obviously something with their parents that they have that is passed down. I don\u2019t fucking know. But, yeah, when you put it that way, yeah, it is intense. When you think of it that way, that each one of those interactions is about their own -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is about them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: Including something like I mean, think about ironing a shirt. It can look like I am doing this favor for my child but actually what is happening is you are not allowing the child to learn the responsibility to go iron the shirt himself if he wants it ironed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then now a couple of years later, now you are all stressed and freaked out because your oldest kid can\u2019t deal with college. Well, why do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: Guess why. (laughs) It wasn\u2019t good for him that you were ironing his shirt at that age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: Right, right. Or constantly getting them take out. Come on, you know? But, yeah, no, they all have it. I mean now with my other aunt, after this whole thing, I kind of hate to say it but now I understand why I think her children kind of can\u2019t deal with her, I think. She is so out there. I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201971\">I love her, I love her but I am not her kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">And I wonder if maybe they just can\u2019t take it anymore. You know? A lifetime of that level of paranoia and she has no fucking friends. She has no life, kind of. (pause) So, yeah it is just <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">(very long pause, sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">CLIENT: That is a really good way to put it. That is very helpful. That each one of those interactions is about her grappling with her own anxieties and weird fears and worries and this and that. That then I had to take all these years to try to, you know, overcome. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Well there is no creative space then to just form your own identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Because you are constantly being smothered by her brain (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Even in ways that would look like taking care of you it actually was still neglect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: And that is what is funny about a thing like ironing a shirt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: That can be a form of neglect because it is neglecting taking care of the child\u2019s needs to learn to be responsible for certain things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: To be individuals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: To be individuals.

And the thing is, you know, it is not just my family but I have noticed a lot of these kind of immigrant, extended family, tight night, whatever. Anything like that kind of what you just said, I mean, it literally means nothing to them. Because do you know what they will say? \u201cOne day <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B51\">when you have kids you will understand.\u201d You can\u2019t win.

It is never even a conversation. They just listen and then they overreact and get defensive and this and that. And then they just end up by saying, \u201cYou have no idea. When you have a kid then we will see how you do.\u201d You know? It is like, alright, then I guess there is nothing to talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B91\">about.

I was like, wow, I used <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD1\">to be really concerned. Like, \u201cIs he going to write about us?
