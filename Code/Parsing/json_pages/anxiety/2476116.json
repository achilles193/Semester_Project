some of the sessions, or did it lightly, or made some last minute <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E1\">effort in order to please me (the therapist). We discussed these matters in a productive way.

This was probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E2\">due to her not having\/making time to more thoroughly read material I had given her about them or to question me more fully about them in earlier sessions.
