data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I... (inaudible at 0:00:06) I just wanted to remind you that I'm out next week...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Son of a bitch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: And we haven't talked about that for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh, that's next week? Son of a... that's cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I don't know if you saw the paper I gave you a while ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: You said you thought you'd lost it, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's all good. That's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I realized it didn't sound like it was in your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, no. Okay, cool. No problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I'm here Monday and Tuesday, but unfortunately we don't meet those days. (Chuckling) So it's only the second half of the week, which covers our days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. No, that's fine. (Pause) So going to the dentist Tuesday. (Pause) [0:00:57] It's a guy I know, so... and my... we have... one of my really good Assyrian friends talked to him for me. And so, if you can cut him... so that's really nice. And he does cosmetic as well, so I'm going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">see if he can just take care of this shit so I don't have to worry about it again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Cosmetic meaning...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: So after they do the cleaning... they gave me an hour or two. So they're going to clean and all that. But then whatever this gum thing is here... I'm just wondering if, instead of having to always wear this retainer several hours a day or whatever... if there's a way he can... the gap is so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">small now, and just put a veneer thing or... I don't know, just be done with it. Anyway, I'm doing that. I heard back from London. She basically just told me to get in touch again with the creative writing... because I haven't heard back from the new creative writing... who I know, but I haven't heard <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">back. [0:01:58] I don't know if I... they just didn't get the e-mail or what. So I just wrote...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: The new meaning the new chair or administrative person? Chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, who I know. I mean, I know him personally. And he's a nice guy, so I don't... it's not a big deal. But maybe he just didn't get my e-mail or something. But I wrote to this woman who I really liked while I was there. She's one of the heads of the department as well. So I wrote to her. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">she was really nice. She's like, write to Walter (sp?) again. And... but she's like, in the meantime, yeah, I mean, I'd be happy to hear, what is your dissertation about and blah blah blah. But I kind of don't know what it's about. So I think I need to seriously figure this shit out. I'm really bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">at... I've not been able to figure out... you would think a guy that loves literature and creative writing... I can't figure out what my dissertation is about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: What's the format? (Pause) [0:02:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: The format is a manuscript but then a whole critical... so it doesn't... so the critical part is not going to be... is not as long as a general just straight PhD, hundreds and hundreds of pages? You have your manuscript, which should be over... for poetry should be over 50 or 60 pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So your manuscript though could be 50 or 60 pages of poetry? You are poetry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Basically you have a book. If you're a fiction writer you have something, poetry, whatever. So a poetry manuscript is usually 48 to 60 pages. So then... but then you do need a critical component that is somehow related to your process or your thoughts about poetry. And for some reason I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">can't whittle that down. I don't know. It's very hard for me. I don't know why. [0:03:55] But... maybe because I just kind of don't care (chuckling). I care, but I'm not... and I'm intimidated? I just don't write scholarly papers well. I don't... footnotes and all... I'm just not... it's [not an innately] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">(ph)... it just annoys me. And I don't understand it very well. And (pause) I've just gotten away with it for a long time. So I don't know. I have to decide something, because then I feel weird trying to explain to these people, who... you know what I mean? I feel like I'm kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560550\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like either a fraud or I'm just kind of saying some general shit that doesn't... (Pause) But anyway it was nice to hear from her. So... (Pause) And I heard back from Boston College, so it's too late for this year. He was like, I'll be happy to meet with you. But he's like, right <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">now is orientation. [0:04:59] So he's like, we could meet in September sometime, which in a way maybe that's good. That gives me time to really see what I could do with the business. Maybe I don't need it, do you know what I mean? I mean, that would be great to not have to go into more debt. So I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">going to think of it as a test period. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: That would mean you probably wouldn't then, even if you met with him in September...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: If you wanted to you'd have to wait until January probably to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: No, I think they have this weird thing where you start in the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And this is the following summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Okay, so you wouldn't do it this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: It was... so it would be 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Right. Okay. Not like, in other words... you originally were thinking you'd start actually right in September.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: No, I just... I think I had this idea that maybe they have either... not a rolling thing. But if it's not the fall it can be the spring or whatever, you know what I mean? [0:05:56] Boston College is sometimes like that. But in this case it's not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: That actually makes some sense. It's not what I would have expected. So every summer they start a new (inaudible at 0:06:06) class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So that gives you some time even beyond summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: And again, I mean, I don't know. Maybe... it's Boston College. I could tell them, well, is it okay if I take some courses? I mean, it's an online program. Could I enroll for a couple courses and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, and then transfer in if you get (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, do well, and do my application. So yeah, I don't know. But it's... so it's a test period. I'll be able to see if the business is somehow... I'm like, okay, this is kind of ramping up pretty good. Then I don't need that. (Pause) I don't know. (Pause) Then I talked to my friend Bernard about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">copywriting? [0:06:55] I have two friends... some of these guys in this bachelor party this weekend, they work in advertising, media stuff. And (pause) I've always thought... there've been times when I've been like, I think I'd be a good... what the fuck's copywriting? Hey, I have a Coffee Coolata, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">I don't think it's rocket science. It's just, I think it's a little hard to break into, you know what I mean, because every time I've looked at positions... send us a portfolio, send us this, send us... but I don't take it seriously enough to sit down and come up with my own fake portfolio and all that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200613\">shit. But I don't know, Bernard's going to talk to his people. I don't know. If I could do something like that freelance or contract or... those guys get paid well, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560550\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don't know. All these things are tricky though, because it's like, then your unemployment is gone. [0:07:56] I mean, as soon as you're making something that they can track obviously... so I just... that's the only thing that's... (Pause) It's a little scary, you know what I mean? If it's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">a permanent thing... (Pause) But whatever. You've got to look into different options. (Pause) [0:08:59] [This week's been] (ph) pretty productive, I guess. (Pause) Oh, then another thing... remember I was telling you that time there was a pit bull in my backyard? I guess it happened to my mom, too, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">recently. Now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: And unleashed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, this... I'm assuming it's the same dog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I'm assuming it's the same dog. I don't know. I kind of don't know why it's happening... I don't... if it's someone that lives really close by, I don't know why it doesn't happen more often in a way? Why is it happening every few months? I mean, that was two months ago now or whatever it was. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">But here's the thing, though. I got kind of upset about it? But it felt... when I look back on it, it felt good to not get too upset, you know what I mean? [0:09:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Like the time it happened to you. You came in and were sort of feeling (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was really annoyed by that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: You were annoyed... no, but you also said you felt like you didn't overreact either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, no. Even in the moment I was very calm oddly enough, whatever. But yeah, just... you know what? First of all... (Pause) I mean, first... my mind does... it's like, Jesus Christ. That's dangerous, and those... and also it's something I've always...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. It's illegal (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, illegal, and it's also my own... I have a... I mean, I guess it's not a phobia if I see a pit bull and I'm not freaked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (Laughing) Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: But I had some bad experience... I always have this worst case scenario, I'm just... I just don't like those kinds of dogs. I get nervous around them, whatever. But then part of me was like, well, wait a minute. I mean, if it happened twice, if it is completely insane, it would have already <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">bitten you kind of probably... I mean... you know what I mean? [0:10:59] If it's in your backyard and it has the opportunity to just (chuckling)... then it just kind of would, especially if it is one of those nut job ones. So I was like... so that was the first thing was, okay, well, wait a minute. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">It wasn't even there with its owner, you know what I mean? So if it really wanted to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Maybe (ph) it's just getting out (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, so if it wanted to there's no one there to control it. It could just... so that made me feel a little bit... not better, but I was like, alright, well, that's two experiences and twice where it didn't come charging, trying to take your head off or something. It could be that it's maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">some... pit bulls are just scary, you know what I mean? So even when they're being friendly (chuckling), they just look scary. They bark, and they... they're dogs., that's... they bark, and they might want to... they're greeting you, or they just want to jump or play or whatever. So that was one. [0:11:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560550\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">Then the second thing was, I just went online. I was like, alright, what can I do to keep dogs...? What do people do to keep dogs out of their yard? It's not rocket science. So I just looked that up, [and I do that] (ph). It's like vinegar, ammonia. (Pause) Worse comes to worst there's a natural kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">of... not pepper spray, but it's a spray. But it doesn't... it's just a temporary... it doesn't really damage them. Whatever. So in other words I was like, yeah, that is really annoying. But (pause) it's not like this guy's out to annoy me or my mom or whatever, our house, you know what I mean? (Chuckling) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">It's obviously going through other people's yards, too, if the guy lives around there somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's not personal. But it's still...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: It's annoying. Something should be done about it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: You could call Animal Control, too, next time you see it (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know what they would do if...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: They come get it for a pit bull and read the tag or try to find the owner. [0:12:59] And then the owner could get fined (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess, yeah, how would they know...? I don't know where this person lives.

Yeah, no, I'll probably call them just... at least, why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: You don't have to, but that's... I mean, that's (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: No, I think I might do it anyway, even for liability, because our tenant has a dog? I would feel really bad if (pause) it bit her dog and I hadn't said anything to Animal Control. Yeah, it's just annoying. I don't know why people do stupid shit. But again the other thing is, I don't get why <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">it's so intermittent. So it's on a leash sometimes, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Sounds like it's sneaking out of the house (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I wonder if it just gets our or something? I don't... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: And they don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Then I was like, well, I could even buy those fences at Home Depot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) It sounds like a lot on you for the owner not taking care of keeping their dog out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. [0:13:56] I kind of like fences anyway, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well then, that's different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Those kind of ornamental... not just chain link, but you can just hammer them into the ground. But yeah, no, I mean, I agree, that's... I'm not going to do that. But yeah, no, it was just like, yeah, that's annoying but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It wasn't personal anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I forgot about it. I mean, I just looked shit up, and then I forgot about it, you know what I mean? There was nothing to dwell on. It's like, alright, it's a dog. And also the dog, it doesn't mean... it doesn't know, you know what I mean? I don't like those kinds of dogs, but I'm getting... <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">maybe now because I have a pet, I don't know. But it's a creature.

I quickly went back in the house. She was like... but she didn't go on and on about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">it? But, I mean, I don't like that. She's an old lady, woman downstairs...

I just thought maybe you need some (pause) time to... I didn't want to be like, how are you, every day. [0:18:02] I don't know. I didn't know how to... (Pause) So yeah, now I feel odd (ph). But I've apologized profusely. I've been thinking about you. I feel really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF2\">awful, and... I don't know. But I also don't to... I mean, if she's upset, she's upset. I don't... what can I do? I'm very surprised though that... I mean, I almost feel like saying, well, I mean, obviously an illness is an illness. That's no... it's serious.

I don't want to... do you know what I mean? I don't want to say any of that. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">like, the best thing to do is just apologize, tell her I'm thinking about her.

It's like, that's great that you... I guess I did. [0:19:57] <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">But you've got to let people know, man. You've got to use your words. I mean... (Pause) Oh man. (Pause) Meanwhile, my poor cousin in San Francisco, the sister of the jackass at MSU that stopped talking to everybody, she... I mean, she has MS. She's falling down. She's in really bad shape, really bad. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB2\">She's kind of like me and my mom. She only has her son? Her husband who was a really great guy passed away, actually passed away when my second cousin was way younger than me. The kid was only 13, 14 or something. And it's all... it's just... (Pause) [0:20:59] I don't know. Because my other cousins <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB3\">were here for just a weekend. My first... two of... one of my first cousins on my dad's side, my... great people. And so I asked, how's Harold (sp?) doing? I was just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Here from where?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: All my first cousins who are on my dad's side are in San Francisco now, except for one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So they came here (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: So one of them... so the one I'm talking about with MS is one of my first cousins?

That's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Your dad's brother's.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Exactly. And then the one who is here is my dad's sister's... one of her... yeah. And these are all... these are the ones where I'm way younger than them? They're all... not way younger, but younger. Yeah, my mom and I were just like... well, I mean, we knew that it wasn't great. But (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D71\">I don't know. [0:21:55] And really I think... I don't know. It's like I want to do... I feel like, for my dad and my uncle, someone has to do something, you know what I mean? But there's nothing to be done, you know what I mean? But it's an embarrassment. That's a fucking... for our family has such <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D72\">an impeccable reputation because of my uncle, and not just my uncle, because they're just great people. It's just like, what...? That's such a fucking embarrassment. It's such an embarrassment. And I don't even mean embarrassment on a superficial... like, what are the neighbors going to think? I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D73\">a real... a moral failing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Wait (ph), what's an embarrassment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: This fucking asshole. The two brothers don't do any... they don't call her. They don't check in. I mean, they don't talk to any of us, including their own sister. [0:22:57] And it's just like, are you kidding me right now? So you're leaving it on your poor nephew? And they don't have a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB1\">money. They don't... they're middle class, lower middle class people. It's... I don't know. It's beyond words. And she's such a good person. And Melanie (sp?) was telling me, you know Harold. She still... but it's like, Melanie, but why is she...? There are all kinds of services for people. She could <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB2\">have a... she's like, I know. She won't do it. She's always like, I'm fine. It's very my dad's side.

That's... I was like, that's not right for her son either. She was like, I know. [0:23:56] She's like, we do... my aunt, who's 90 years old, takes care of her. That's... (Pause) Which... I mean, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">was like, that's... not that it's awesome. But that's why I love my... I mean, [both sides] (ph), look at what my mom's doing. (Chuckling) But on my dad's side they have such a much more... (Pause) They put a humorous spin on things that's so admirable, you know what I mean? My aunt still smokes, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD2\">drinks coffee. They just have this zest, you know what I mean, that's so awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">But that's ridiculous that that woman has to be... doesn't have to be, I mean. But she offers willingly, without... she wants to take care of her niece. I don't know. My mom and... I don't know. [0:24:56] (Pause) I mean, now I've gotten to the point where, when people ask me, now I don't hide it anymore. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">They're like, hey, how's your cousin at MSU? I just tell them. I'm like, you know what? I really don't care how he is. And they're, whoa, what...? I'm... he hides behind this position that he has. And it's like, you know what?

And he was such a sweet guy who loved them, loved all... you know what I mean? I don't understand the... that's some kind of... that's like a mental <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">illness. I don't understand that. My dad and their dad never had one cross word. [0:25:59] When their dad came to the wake, when he walked in there, I'll never forget. He ran to... he's way older than my dad, ran to the casket and picked my dad up, cradled him in his... I mean (pause), this is... there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E32\">a lot of love in that family. And it's just like, you're just being a fucking... beyond an asshole. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Just sounds (ph) selfish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's a very... I don't know what's happened, to both of them. That's the weird thing. Do they talk to each other? Or do they also not talk to each other now? I don't know. But yeah, I don't know. We're helpless. What do you do? I write to my second... her son once every six... I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">know what to do, you know what I mean? I'll just write to him and say, hey, [we can] (ph)... if there's anything I can do... there's nothing I can do. [0:26:59] But... I don't know. (Pause) I don't know. Just it really rubs me the wrong way. You cannot talk to us, but man, that's some really cold stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E72\">to do to somebody. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: It's an abandonment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, big time. The only... I mean, I was telling my cousin... I was like, well, the only... it's not a consolation at all? But I was like, just know that, I mean, he's got on one. He's got his wife, who I always thought was a really nice person. I don't know what her involvement is or isn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">in any of this? But I was like, he's on an island. He's just got his position. But I don't know him to have any tight, real friends, or... (Pause) [0:28:04] Yeah, I don't know. (Pause) In that way my uncle's being amazing, when I look in comparison? The guy's around. He does what he can. (Chuckling) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB2\">He's got type II diabetes. [0:28:56] I mean, he's doing the best he can. It's not perfect at all, but...

I just don't like you, I'm going to cut... and she's out in her professorship at... she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">a fucking mess. I mean, she's got issues. It's becoming more and more obvious with each year. But she calls. She... there's something. There's some semblance of still family-ness. (Pause) It's bizarre, absolutely bizarre.

I mean, I already feel... my mom's side, just all the shit we went through, the family just... it's as if it changed overnight. A lot of the men were gone, two of them, then my grandfather. My aunt was sick for all those years in such a terrible... it just was awful. Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">it... and now, like I said, with my aunt, that Portsmouth faction... (Pause) I had that cousin who... he stopped calling. Now he's around, and it's fine. We don't have an issue. But it's too late now almost, you know what I mean? And he still might (ph) make an effort. [0:30:56] He's here, he still... <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F12\">if I see him at a family thing, everything's fine. But it's like, I'm not going to kiss his ass. The guy didn't talk to me for no reason for two years. I mean, I'm being nice to him. He's got to make effort, but I'm done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">So yeah, there (ph)... but I always thought my dad's side was the (pause), what's the word, consistent, you know what I mean? Never ever... I mean, just always laughter and warmth and not taking things too seriously and... and especially because it's him, I guess? I mean, I did kind of look up to him, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">and fuck. Not one word when my book came out, tells me not to ever get in touch with him again, which I first... now I realize erroneously... because it just seemed like it was just me and my mom or something, you know what I mean? But then all this... I mean, just it's... the guy's cut out the whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F32\">family. [0:31:56] Your 90 year old aunt? I don't know.

You have these two old aunts. I mean... (Pause) But I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F33\">know. It's... yeah, it's beyond a disappointment, I think especially because my dad and his dad... even more than the aunts, they really had a special, I mean, just really tight bond, really tight.

But there's a lot you're talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">about right now in your family that... everything changed, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560550\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's similar.

So I think then I would miss this part, seeing you. And I look forward to that, so then... you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">know what I mean? I was thinking about that. I was like, I think that's one of the things I wouldn't like, that I can't have actual eye contact and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

[0:34:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: What do you lose?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, obviously it's a different feel if you can just look at somebody and... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: Of course it is. But I think that can mean different things to people. Eye contact can feel safer. It can feel like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: Well, it's more like a... yeah, there's a feeling of more intimate friendship kind of thing, instead of just a patient doctor thing. (Pause) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: It's so interesting, because I actually think there's a way it can get more intimate if you're actually a patient, where you get to go, instead of social banter. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, the feelings, the things you talk about get more intimate. Yeah, I guess I'm just talking about the actual interaction of it. Yeah, I don't know. [0:35:01] Or it could be that it's not a big deal at all. I'm just... it's just another thing that... excuse that I find to not do it. But... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Losing the fantasy that you're not a patient when you're sitting up (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: No, I mean, I... (chuckling) clearly I know I'm a patient. But yeah, it's like (pause), I can do all the patient things, but I don't think about it while I'm here, you know what I'm saying? I'm obviously working hard, but I don't think about that dynamic. I think about it when I'm not here. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">Like, oh, what Claire (sp?) said made a lot of sense, and she's probably right. I process it. But when I'm in here I don't... (Pause) [0:36:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: So much more for us to know about that. (Chuckling) And the bell's ringing. So tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Thanks, Claire. See you tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
