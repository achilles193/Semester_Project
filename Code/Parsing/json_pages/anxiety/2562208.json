I mean I know your usual view of these things is that doing that throws you and staying away from it helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not so sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying with a lot of certainty I know that\u2019s what happened; I don\u2019t. And I do know often that [thinking about] (ph) typical towards Xavier or anxious stuff like that does throw you at least for a while. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I guess what I have in mind is less of you resolved everything and I helped you feel better and more of it was a little more contained and a little easier to put down as a result. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. I think Monday I was kind of affected all day or not. I was turning over what we talked about yesterday typically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Anyway I know a lot of it was about feeling like moving, going to UNC, moving back to Boise, moving backwards. Actually it was something that ends like some many things feel like sort of feel like going backwards and forwards at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Yes, I mean I think maybe it felt more contained or I don\u2019t know. Or I could I guess more easily push it aside and not let it affect me. It just doesn\u2019t feel resolved or, I don\u2019t know, it just feels like something I don\u2019t want to deal with. That\u2019s what I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">about right now. At least this is just not as consuming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: And yet I do think you it\u2019s tricky. I think at the same time you do feel like it\u2019s encroaching and you probably [inaudible at 00:06:09] with wanting to talk about it or having to deal with it. I think you should talk about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Which I don\u2019t necessarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: What makes me think that is what you said a few minutes ago about feeling like you really should kind of build this shield around yourself, I mean as though this stuff were coming at you from outside, I guess in part from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It was, I mean it was that and I\u2019m trying not to get flustered or angry about stuff at work or I don\u2019t know and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I see, you misunderstood? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. But the stuff about I don\u2019t know. But I agree with you what you were talking about Boise and my parents. I don\u2019t really yes I guess I kind of don\u2019t really want to go into it more. I feel like going on I just don\u2019t have anything else to say and I don\u2019t really want to go into it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">or deal with it or I don\u2019t know. But I mean I think that\u2019s because my mood yesterday morning was just kind of [inaudible at 00:08:22] for healing. I was just wondering why can\u2019t it just be, why do I have to kind of focus on the terminal (ph), negative or just kind of always feeling dissatisfied. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Yes, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just easier putting some distance or just distracting myself from kind of why am I, the question of why am I unhappy or what do I want or focusing more on the work or class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">I don\u2019t know. I guess I mean I\u2019m starting to see this will come up again, [inaudible at 00:12:49] and I\u2019ll feel kind of overwhelmed with not having my I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562208\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I think what strikes me is you\u2019re telling me is that it\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t certainly seem okay to be feeling I don\u2019t know or more distanced from the stuff that was really troubling you the last couple of days. That I guess what I\u2019m saying is you seem to feel as you were feeling it was better <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">anxious that you\u2019re not doing something right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And I guess a little sort of focused on how you should be managing yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I mean I guess, I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s still not like, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still not kind of living the way I want to or I\u2019m still, I still think I should be doing things better and, I don\u2019t know. I guess throughout the day it\u2019s kind of like focus on, focus on what am I going to do out here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">sort of what am I going to do about whatever. And I just want to think. I need to be doing this or worrying about [inaudible at 00:16:18] looking right. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">But again I can say it\u2019s kind of, again I\u2019m not doing or I\u2019m not kind of functioning correctly like I should keep something in mind or I should be more organized or plan or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Today you seem like, to the core of what we\u2019re talking about, to be feeling more intense, more confused, more upset. And I just [inaudible at 00:19:37] pretty clear there\u2019s something in our interaction that\u2019s causing that; I got to try to get a handle on what it is. It seems that [pause] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">like there\u2019s something about you talking to me or the way that I talk to you, I\u2019m not sure, that puts you back in touch with ways you feel more upset and confused. And I can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s something in the way that I\u2019m talking to you or something that you project onto me. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">But to me it\u2019s either [inaudible at 00:21:22] I\u2019m feeling better, feeling easier, feeling a little more distant from the things that are upsetting me and I\u2019m having a relatively easier time focusing on the things I need to get through, relatively speaking. And somehow that erodes as we\u2019re talking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: My guess is that I still feel kind of what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m still, even though maybe I\u2019m functioning a little better, I\u2019m still unhappy or I\u2019m still kind of critical or mad at myself so I must be doing something wrong. And so I feel like the way I\u2019m kind of talking about it I need -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s like you\u2019re sort of taking a class where there\u2019s a typical door (ph) like a Sunday project you\u2019re feeling a little bit behind where you\u2019re supposed to be. And when you go to class it kind of reminds you of that feeling. Like oh shit, I really should really along (ph) on this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">term paper and I haven\u2019t really picked a topic yet and it\u2019s Tuesday, being a little bit like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I can also imagine that sometimes things I say feel like they kind of poke holes in ways you have been feeling [inaudible at 00:23:55] or feeling more okay. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do or that possibly that\u2019s what I seem to be trying to do but like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:24:29].
