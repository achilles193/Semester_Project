So, I had to take my mom to the ER yesterday. Yeah. Another time I was totally having a lovely time with two of my Assyrian friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: For anxiety, again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: She at first that\u2019s what I thought it was because she sounded fine. I mean so but her heart rate was abnormal. Turns out her hypothyroid medication is too high, the dose, so it gave her hyperthyroid. So luckily we were only there like two hours or whatever it was. But I was pissed enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">that I did text my uncle. I edited it; I didn\u2019t send it. But I kind of just I don\u2019t remember how I said it, but I was like you know I love you, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not blaming you, but this a lot of this has to do with how exhausted and stressed she\u2019s been because of grandma. [00:01:12.21] I was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">this just can\u2019t continue this way. I was like just like you\u2019re worried about your mom, I\u2019m worried about my mom. I was like I know everyone is doing their best, but my mom\u2019s in her seventies. This is so nothing\u2019s going to change. But I was angry with my mom. I controlled myself, but I\u2019m not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">to yell at my mom in the ER, but I was forceful. I was like because she\u2019s like don\u2019t get involved, don\u2019t get upset with your uncle, it\u2019s not his fault. I was like I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s my uncle\u2019s fault; it\u2019s all of your faults. I was like this is the most mishandled, in denial situation I\u2019ve ever seen <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">in my life. I was like put her in a nice home, fucking go visit her 8 hours a day if you want. [00:02:05.07] It\u2019s not a prison. You know what I mean? Take her to Hoag. I don\u2019t know. Do whatever you want. She\u2019ll have proper care so that when you\u2019re tired or he has fucking diabetes, you can take of yourselves. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200155\">That\u2019s all. But luckily I had initially sent a much more forceful text. I was like this is disrespectful and insulting. It\u2019s like unfair. But I was like you know what? Pointless. That\u2019s pointless to say all that stuff because my uncle, I think, really, the guy\u2019s not being an asshole. His heart\u2019s in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200156\">the right place. His heart\u2019s in the right place. No one\u2019s forcing my mom to do anything. My other aunt, I am pretty done with. That one, that\u2019s some selfish, weird shit there. But I was already kind of done with her anyway. I don\u2019t both I just wish my uncle would step up and but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200157\">[00:03:06.05] Then again, it\u2019s not my mom. It\u2019s my grandma. I don\u2019t know. You know what I mean? Like I the only thing well my uncle finally got there. He got there with his wife, even though I told him you don\u2019t have to come; I think they\u2019re going to let her go or whatever. But they came in. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200158\">only thing I did say was because his wife was saying that I guess my uncle, last night or something, wasn\u2019t feeling well at all. His sugar had gone too low instead of high. And so I was like you guys have got to take better care of yourselves. You\u2019ve got to be a little more and my uncle was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200159\">he was like yeah, I know it\u2019s a bad habit. We just kind of don\u2019t think. We don\u2019t I was like yeah, but uncle, you know what? It stresses the rest of us out. I was like I don\u2019t why am I in this situation right now. Yes, obviously, okay, it\u2019s the thyroid medication, right. But the last time when she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001510\">had that panic attack or whatever that was, I was like this is just it\u2019s not good for your kids. [00:04:05.17] You\u2019re not thinking that it really stresses people out and it\u2019s unnecessary stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561728\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel like this is more the stress on her instead of the thyroid medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: I mean okay, it\u2019s the thyroid. Obviously if the doctor said it was the thyroid, it\u2019s the thyroid medication. What I\u2019m saying, though, is that in general, if this was just an isolated incident, I\u2019d say, okay, I guess this is the thyroid medication. And I guess it is. In this case. But that last <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">time I had to rush over and she was having a panic attack, the general exhaustion and nervousness she\u2019s always feeling...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s complaining about that anyway, you\u2019re saying, all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: She says it enough to complain ph]. She just is. She even said something really heartbreaking in the emergency room. And she said it very matter of fact. She\u2019s like you know in the past, when I was younger, when I would feel a certain way, whatever, I would just cry. [00:05:03.01] She\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">I don\u2019t can\u2019t even do that anymore. She\u2019s like I\u2019m just my heart\u2019s just kind of like a rock now or something. So you know what I mean? The woman\u2019s been through a lot. They all have. They all have been through a lot. But my uncle too. The guy\u2019s a young guy. I mean why who should have someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">who\u2019s that successful, who\u2019s not a fat slob, why should he have type 2 serious diabetes. Like it\u2019s just I know it happens but they\u2019re just they\u2019re constantly, constantly fucking stressed over silly things. Or they mishandle things that could just be taken care of. Anyway, that being said, I\u2019m very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">proud of myself. I handled it on the way to the hospital I was telling my mom you\u2019re fine, everything\u2019s fine. I was coaching I\u2019m like can you take a deep breath. [00:06:01.16] I was like just try to take a deep breath. But I don\u2019t know. I gave her some other tricks too. I don\u2019t know. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: It\u2019s well you know what? It\u2019s just absurd. I mean even when they got there I was like I\u2019m getting really tired of coming to this hospital. And so the my uncle\u2019s wife, she\u2019s like yeah, really. This is just we\u2019re here way too often. People need to take better care of themselves. Things happen but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean it was a I\u2019m glad I told texting is a good way to not because I knew that if I talked to him it could go in directions I didn\u2019t want because I was feeling really upset and frustrated and but after, I just wrote everything out and I waited; I didn\u2019t send it, I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">send it, I didn\u2019t send it. [00:07:17.11] Walked around the hospital, whatever, checked on my mom, checked on my mom. And I kept editing it down to finally I just kept it to the main points, like look, grandma needs 24\/7 care, period. And my mom just can\u2019t do this anymore. I love you. I\u2019m not blaming <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">you. I just this is just really, really stressful and frustrating, and my mom\u2019s exhausted. And I just it can\u2019t go on the way it\u2019s been going on. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure nothing\u2019s probably going to change, which is why I didn\u2019t want to get because I also that\u2019s my mom\u2019s fault. If I got into it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">then it\u2019s a waste. I\u2019d be defending my mom. [00:08:03.20] But today, my uncle\u2019s over today. They\u2019re hanging out. So that means that I can\u2019t you know what I mean? This has always happened in our history. I stand up for people and like fucking just let someone have it or whatever, but then two days <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">later the pattern\u2019s back to what it was. They\u2019re so I think it\u2019s about me, maybe. I just have to be like you know what? They\u2019re content. My mom\u2019s not angry at her brother. And my uncle\u2019s a lovely guy. He\u2019s not trying to be a dick. It just is what it is. My mom happens to have more free time and is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200255\">a woman. And is the oldest. My uncle\u2019s the youngest. He\u2019s a guy. He\u2019s got a family and a very stressful business, and he\u2019s not able to 8 hours a day or whatever commit. But the guy\u2019s there a number of times a week. So maybe that\u2019s just is what it is. You know what I mean? I somehow so I guess what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200256\">I\u2019m starting to try to say, though, is that part of the thing that I\u2019m proud of is I did kind of let it go. [00:09:09.19] Like see today I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not my mom\u2019s fine. I said my piece to my uncle. I mean I love my grandma. It\u2019s not like I want them to throw her into a nursing home, but at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200257\">I said what I think needed to be said. Because it\u2019s also my mom. You know what I mean? It would be different if my mom really was being forced you know what I\u2019m saying? But the fact that she can\u2019t maybe she\u2019s getting better at it. I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s telling me that she\u2019s become more she\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200258\">telling them honestly that it\u2019s getting harder and harder and she can\u2019t keep up, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561728\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s been saying that to your uncle?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean and that\u2019s one thing about my mom. I do believe her on that. My mom is like my grandfather in that way. When something comes to a certain point she\u2019ll suddenly be blunt about it. [00:10:04.23] It\u2019s like this weird dichotomy. Honestly? I mean I saw my grandma today. I hate to say <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">it, maybe they\u2019re just very subconsciously they feel like there\u2019s not much time left anyway. Because I went down there today and she still doesn\u2019t have her dentures. She wasn\u2019t she knew me, but she wasn\u2019t very animated, and she didn\u2019t even really say anything. So I think maybe they just feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">look, this is this can\u2019t go on that much longer anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Maybe she wants to spend time with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: My mom? That was the thing, yeah. Because last night she was like we have to call the nurse because they\u2019re going to bring her over in the morning, bah, bah, bah. But as soon as she felt fine again, my uncle got there and she\u2019s like no. She\u2019s like Derek my mom\u2019s going to come over mom said <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">no, no, no. I\u2019ll take care of that. [00:11:02.18] I\u2019ll just go pick her up in the morning. My mom was like no, no, tell them to bring mom, but then you can and then you can come to our house and then you can take her from there. So yeah, there\u2019s definitely, I think, it\u2019s their mom. I mean I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s the practical side of which is so understandable about your wanting your grandmother to have [inaudible] care. She\u2019s at a point where [inaudible] dangerous for her too. I also think there may be some element in this, though, that you\u2019re saying [inaudible] speak to that. When you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">hear your mother needs to go to the emergency room, it is it\u2019s scary. And you may want to turn to someone, like if only your uncle would do this or if only this would change then this wouldn\u2019t happen. [inaudible] start thinking, for example, maybe she\u2019s doing better. She may be in a better place [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F2\">taking care of your grandmother. There may be something [inaudible] about that. A lot of these things could be happening anyway. [00:12:09.18]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561728\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, she\u2019s no, part I mean yeah, yeah. I mean but that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m saying, that I feel good not good, but I mean I\u2019m kind of ready. You know what I mean? We\u2019ve gone through enough that especially lately I\u2019ve been more my mom\u2019s in her 70s now. And yeah, of course, anything\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">she broke her hip, she I mean thank God she\u2019s okay, but she\u2019s in her 70s. I mean it is what it is. So I think it\u2019s that. It\u2019s also, I think, deep down I feel some guilt\u2019s not the right word. I feel sadness that she\u2019s had a hard life and she hasn\u2019t had a good stretch of just like, I don\u2019t know, no <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200312\">not that many issues. She went from her sister being sick for years and being around for that, after my dad, after my uncle, and then my grandfather. [00:13:09.07] And now I don\u2019t know. I just feel like shouldn\u2019t she have like a stretch where just every day she can kind of do what she wants and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200313\">I don\u2019t know. But you\u2019re right. I mean I\u2019m coming at it from my ideas about retirement and this you know what I mean? They are old school that way. So you know what I\u2019m saying? Like for her, yeah, maybe there is something about as much as it might drag her down sometimes, I think she feels very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200314\">proud that she and she loves her, obviously. My grandma\u2019s she even said in the emergency room yesterday, she\u2019s like I used to be so tough. She\u2019s like and so I was saying well, you\u2019re still tough. You just need to chill. I was like you don\u2019t know how to chill. So she said that. She goes yeah, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200315\">right son. You\u2019re right. [00:14:01.19] And I feel so bad that I stress you out. So I go okay, the first thing we should do I was like you see, you\u2019re doing it again. Now you\u2019re making a list of the things you should do to [inaudible] Oh, she\u2019s like, you\u2019re right. She\u2019s like why do I do this. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200316\">like why can\u2019t I be like my mother. She\u2019s like I\u2019m not like my mother. I was like yeah, none of you are. I was like I\u2019m like your mother. I was like yeah, you guys just aren\u2019t like grandma. You\u2019re like grandpa. He was a great guy but he was wound up and constantly pretty much negative. Anyway, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200317\">I\u2019m glad she\u2019s okay. I\u2019m glad I handled it well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the feeling coming up thinking about her, that conversation with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: What conversation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: What you were just relating about her saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: I mean my mom always when she broke her hip, when she that\u2019s always our most honest conversations. [00:15:02.21] That\u2019s something she just gets suddenly childlike. You know what I mean? I think maybe just that helplessness of being in an ER. She just says things. I don\u2019t know, the feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">is you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know. Just really it\u2019s like tell me things I don\u2019t know. Just fucking relax. Just relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561728\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it\u2019s another way to feel close to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s all of a sudden...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: I mean I feel close to my mom. I mean everything that I have issues with my mom, but I\u2019m very proud of the fact that unlike other people I know I haven\u2019t iced her out or I haven\u2019t my mom\u2019s a good person. Just we just as personalities clash. And yeah, she\u2019s not she wasn\u2019t always I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">she didn\u2019t know how to be the kind of mom I needed. But no, yeah, I mean yeah, when we went home I made sure I brought down Cecelia so she could have fun with Cecelia. [00:16:11.16] I made sure she ate something. We sat a little bit and went upstairs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: You take care of her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying. I mean I wish financially I could do more for her but I figure at least I\u2019m around. (pause) So that\u2019s that. The second thing is I think...I think... I\u2019m not saying definitely, but I think I\u2019m going to do an MS. UConn has an online program. [00:17:02.22] It\u2019s only $1400 per course, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">so 60 credits. So I don\u2019t know. So the whole thing, I don\u2019t think, should be more than $16,000, or $15,000. I think I\u2019m going to do that. I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: Master...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: MS. Master of Science.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Two years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: 60 credits. I don\u2019t know. It said that they if you already have a graduate degree they would probably wave GRE, MRE [ph] things. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just going to talk to them. [inaudible] the story, this is what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s a degree that could get you an LMHC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, it says something about how they they\u2019re certified to prepare you for either PhD or whatever yeah. [00:18:13.13] Oh, I see. So when you do an MS, you still need some kind of license after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a specific Master\u2019s level in counseling degree where you can that can be a terminal degree. So there are some like a social worker, like an LICS licensed social worker, clinical social worker. There are some people who do the two year Master\u2019s degree in counseling\/psychology that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">get a license in mental health counseling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: So what you\u2019re doing right now, could you do that with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You could get licensed in that. What the licensing will probably require is after you get the degree you might have to do a year or two of internship kind of training, but you\u2019d get some payment for that. I don\u2019t know the specifics, but like social work is three years and then you do two <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">years of paid. It\u2019s paid work but you\u2019re still under the supervision of someone more senior. [00:19:07.27] Once you fulfill those two years you can sit for the licensing exam and do this work. And the same so I think there\u2019s a similar pathway for mental health counseling. That\u2019s different than like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B2\">at BU they have a Master\u2019s in psychology, which is not mental health counseling. That\u2019s just like the first two years of a doctorate program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Like a PhD. No this is yeah, they have it\u2019s mental health counseling. Then they have one in rehabilitation counseling and a third one, I think child and adolescent something Master\u2019s. I mean I\u2019m thinking if nothing else just to have it. I mean I\u2019m thinking, again, for my business. Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">for my business. Then I can be like okay, now I\u2019m not so worried about liability of this. I really am qualified to...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561728\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And [inaudible] you\u2019ll get experience with the kind of things that you\u2019ll be dealing with all the time. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: And obviously I\u2019ve got to pay for it, but I\u2019m already in debt. [00:20:07.05] Fuck it. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to it\u2019s a practical decision because I think I\u2019ll I could do very well. It just seems like the thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] scholarships or financial aid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, it would definitely have to be like loans or aid or yeah, whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: You may want to make sure, for sure, it\u2019s a degree you can get the license for. Even if you decide you don\u2019t want to do that you have that option there. Rather than doing two years of a Master\u2019s that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: Absolutely, yeah, because if I did that then I could maybe work part time. Those things aren\u2019t all full time, right, you can find all kinds of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so if I was doing that part time, that\u2019s making me a little bit of money, and the experience, plus my business. [00:21:00.17] So yeah, I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m very seriously...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: How\u2019d you find that [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: I did research. Yeah, I was like what are the cheapest first I was like what\u2019s the point of getting an MA in psychology, right about that. I was like okay, what are the most affordable MA programs around here. And I\u2019d kind of forgotten about how big online courses are now. I\u2019m not a huge, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">whatever, I like to be in class, but that\u2019s perfect for my now I see why it makes sense. When you\u2019re trying to do other things in your life and start a business or whatever, or work, whatever it is, it\u2019s perfect. And it\u2019s here, so if I needed to go it\u2019s right here. And I know it well. So I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s exciting. [00:22:03.13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the more I think about it, I can\u2019t think of a more perfect candidate, really. I mean yeah, okay, my background\u2019s not in psychology, but Jesus, it\u2019s like my whole life is one big psychological adventure. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: They\u2019ll be looking for probably what your [inaudible] backgrounds [inaudible] way. Then psychology PhDs, they want like cookie cutter researchers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, it did say something about social sciences this or that. It didn\u2019t say it\u2019s a requirement but there was something about that. Maybe for the GRE. Maybe it was like we\u2019ll definitely wave test scores if you have a Master\u2019s in a social science or something like that. But I figure a Master\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">in PhD work, I think I\u2019ve proven my GRE ability. [00:23:03.05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: If not you could take the GREs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: I guess. I really don\u2019t want to fucking do that again. That\u2019s I just I feel way too old to do that again. That was such a fucking waste of time. But yeah, I guess. I guess if I had to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It was a bad experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: I just I think things like that are just an absolute waste of time. I don\u2019t believe in standardized tests at all. At all. I didn\u2019t do that great on the SAT or GRE. I just don\u2019t test well. That\u2019s one. Two, it\u2019s a crapshoot, right. When I applied to Brown, they take like 1,000 people out of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">10,000 applicants. So you\u2019re telling me like you know what I mean? That\u2019s all nonsense. On that day if the dude in the committee didn\u2019t fight with his wife or his boyfriend and he\u2019s feeling good and there are a bunch of people with pretty much the same scores, you know what I mean? [00:24:03.17] It <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200812\">just seems nonsensical to me. I understand they need some form of a cutoff point or something like that but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very suspicious of things like that. I just feel like people\u2019s lives are very complex and their minds aren\u2019t like robots. We just don\u2019t work in that especially when you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200813\">study for it. All you\u2019re studying is test taking strategies. You know what I mean? So yeah, hopefully they won\u2019t need me to do that, but we\u2019ll see. I think I\u2019m just going to write to them and be like look, I can come in and talk to you guys, whatever, just probably let them know I\u2019m starting this business. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200814\">Right? I\u2019d probably want to tell them that. Yeah, be like this is what\u2019s going on. Maybe it\u2019ll help that I went there undergrad and grad. I mean I\u2019m a little it\u2019s no joke. [00:25:04.03] I\u2019m a little nervous about the work that\u2019s involved and all that. But again, I think there\u2019s something about, when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200815\">I think of the practicality of it that\u2019s very motivating. Whereas when you\u2019re doing something like English or whatever, you\u2019re trying to do it for the love of it, but then when you\u2019re in the trenches you\u2019re like what the fuck. I\u2019m trying to do it for the love of it. There\u2019s no jobs. I\u2019m in debt. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200816\">I\u2019m trying to fucking write a 20 page paper on this fucking sonnet. Like it just gets a little absurd sometimes. But there\u2019s something about yeah, no, this is going to fucking pay off almost immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561728\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: You may be able to specialize your training [inaudible] on what topics you write papers on.

I could even do something about like trauma and creativity and you know what I mean? All that stuff. I also wrote to the English department. I was like I didn\u2019t hear back from you guys. I really, really want to finish <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">this. What can we do to I looked at her last e-mail months ago. And she\u2019s like I\u2019m going to look into the statute of limitations and we\u2019ll do what we can to help you finish. Statute of limitations? I was like that seems I almost feel like saying if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m just going to start saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200852\">I have a Master\u2019s. Like I\u2019m not going to keep not putting that up because that\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve done everything. It\u2019s a 50 page thesis. Like come on. Or I\u2019m going to be like can I take like two classes and just like tape it, just fucking splice it together as if I don\u2019t know. [00:27:11.26] It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200853\">so stupid. Or fucking just give me an honorary Master\u2019s degree. I don\u2019t know, whatever. I think we\u2019ll work it out hopefully. I think there\u2019s always a way to do stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t know until you try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Get in their face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, just there\u2019s got to be a way. I\u2019ll be like look, man, statute what is this, prison? Like come on. It literally doesn\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t even know what that means. All the work\u2019s done; it\u2019s not like the study of English literature has completely changed since 2002.

I guess I could be like hey, can I just start <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B92\">taking courses. It\u2019s UConn. Just pay for courses and just start taking them. Yeah, I mean that\u2019s the one thing I love about UConn, generally, at least in the English department. I don\u2019t know. People are very understanding and welcoming. And actually not even just the English department. When I came <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B93\">from UConn I didn\u2019t even apply to get in. I just went and paid for some courses and started taking classes and then did the paperwork. I don\u2019t know. (pause) It just seems right. [00:32:09.23] It feels right. That feels more right to me, by the way, than getting certified in coaching. You know what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B94\">saying. This is like I still kind of don\u2019t I don\u2019t know. I just feel like I think I get the coaching part. I can do that shit. Yeah, it\u2019d be nice like the only thing I would want with that is I\u2019ll get a mentor coach. That I can understand. Let\u2019s say like if I\u2019m studying psychology and I come to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B95\">you and you become like a bit of a mentor, that\u2019s different. That\u2019s different. I would like to do that. Be like look, this is my coaching practice. This I\u2019m going about it, this is kind of what I do in sessions. That\u2019s different to me. But going through a whole paying for a whole fucking thing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B96\">get certified, why wouldn\u2019t I want an actual Master\u2019s of Science to create psychology? [00:33:03.10] I think a lot of people respect that more than something from Bob and Tom\u2019s coaching school.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561728\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">THERAPIST: And it keeps the field, then, even more open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">CLIENT: It keeps exactly. Workwise, yeah, it keeps it open. And also with coaching certification there\u2019s a whole other thing where once you start doing it, you can eventually apply for certification based on your hours. Do you know what I mean? If even, let\u2019s say, you\u2019ve been doing it a year and you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD1\">got all these client hours, you can start trying to get certified based on the work you\u2019ve already done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">THERAPIST: No couch today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">CLIENT: No, I was going to but I felt too antsy.

Let\u2019s see how you feel Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">CLIENT: Okay, cool. All right. Sounds good. 1:00. Thanks Abby. Stay dry.
