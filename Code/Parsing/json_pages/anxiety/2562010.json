I guess it\u2019s not mornings because I had this trouble Friday evening also after work. I worked from home Friday because there was an event on the waterfront I wanted to get to at 5:30 and I thought if I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">don\u2019t have to commute all the way out to 495 and back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I was totally unproductive for work. I got literally nothing done on Friday. It was pretty awful. And then I felt bad about myself and told myself well I can\u2019t leave for this event I want to go to until I do something useful for work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: And so I just stalled and stalled and stalled and I wasn\u2019t actually getting anything done for work. If I had actually been in the flow it would have been fine but I was just making myself miserable until a friend of mine who was at the event texted me and was like, \u2018(unclear)\u2019s here. I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to see you. Please come out.\u2019 I finally showed up at 8.

I\u2019m sorry. I should have let you know what was going on.

Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, I ended up working from home Wednesday because I didn\u2019t get out of bed until 10:30 and that\u2019s usually when I arrive at the office. So I was like yeah, I\u2019m just going to work from home today and dialed in my 11 a.m. meeting because there was no way I was going to make it. (Pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause): [0:03:00 0:03:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean I sort of am in a way taking what you\u2019re saying, partly expressive of the shame you feel about \u2013 that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s this issue in general coming from difficulty getting out or just getting out \u2013 and in part of \u2013 help!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(Pause): [0:03:35 0:03:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I\u2019m late today because I didn\u2019t get out of bed when my alarm went off. I was just like (makes noise), even though I did go to bed at a reasonable hour last night and I took Benadryl to help me sleep which I probably shouldn\u2019t be doing that with a physician\u2019s supervision but it was something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">that my last psychiatrist suggested I should try because she really didn\u2019t like prescribing prescription sleeping aids. She thought Benadryl was safer which I don\u2019t know. Different people have different opinions on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: So I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">(Pause): [0:04:18 0:04:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: This past weekend was a big science fiction event at the waterfront that I was talking about a few minutes ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: And I wasn\u2019t going to go because it always conflicts with Mystery Hunt. Mystery Hunt is a big event of the (unclear) every year for like 12, 13 years. Like the year I was on my honeymoon and still had a team and logged in for the hunt from Hawaii like (unclear). (Laughs) [0:05:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: But yeah, the team I usually hunt with has \u2013 a lot of the people I knew have stopped hunting or have departed for other teams and my team is now mostly undergrads who I don\u2019t know and it wasn\u2019t really fun at all last year. I was pretty miserable for all of hunt last year. No, I\u2019m lying. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">sorry. Last year I was on silent retreat during hunt because I screwed up planning. The year before that was the year I was miserable during hunt. So yeah I was miserable in 2012 and 2013 I just didn\u2019t \u2013 that was just a legitimate like mistake when I was planning my trip. But I had a lot of friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200412\">coming in from out of town who were going to be at an event so I decided to give it a try even though like I hated it the first time I went back in like 2001. Yeah, I went with Ricky, who I was not dating at the time. Phil is the big horrible ex who raped me. But yeah, I hated Arisia the last time I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200413\">went. I think in hindsight, in large part, because Phil and his friends are just horrible human beings.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562010\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">But yeah, I went to the event with the intent of like finding my out of town friends and spending all my time with them and instead I spent all my time with a group of women I knew from Cheshire who like live right here and who I see fairly frequently. (Laughs) It was good. I had a good time. But I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">a little surprised at myself for the decisions I made. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: You mean, in particular, to hang around with them instead of people you don\u2019t see as often?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes. I\u2019m like, part of it is my friends from out of town are \u2013 this is actually relevant \u2013 are all people of color and most of them are writers and so the programming committee put them on panels and things that were very explicitly race related like how to write the other without being racist <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">or why is cultural appropriation wrong? Or, let\u2019s talk about sexism and harassment and (unclear) and how to end it. And those are all really very heavy topics that I\u2019m super-burnt out on. I didn\u2019t sign up for any programming at the event because when I do sign up for programming at Coms (sp?) I do get <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">put on those panels too regardless of what I actually express interest in and on one hand they\u2019re important conversations and usually I\u2019m willing to have them and consider it a service to the community to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">On the other hand I\u2019m burnt out and I needed not to be doing that. And since most of what I do at Coms (sp?) is panels, like attending panels, talking about panels with friends, there are other things to do, but they don\u2019t interest me. Like there\u2019s gaming and music and sing-alongs and dancing and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">don\u2019t know, there are a bunch of theater productions but my primary interest is in lived discussions and conversations with panels, mostly. So yeah, I didn\u2019t want to go to any of my friends\u2019 panels. I\u2019m just tired of those conversations right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">I guess part of it is there is this woman, Mickey \u2013 Mickey Kindle (sp?) who is enormously popular. She is an excellent writer. She\u2019s very smart. She has excellent things to say but she and I just don\u2019t get along \u2013 like oil and water and all of my friends are hanging out with her. All of my out-of-town <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">friends are hanging out with her. She lives in St. Paul. (Unclear) lives in Tucson. Wilson lives in Kentucky. And I just \u2013 for the most part I can hang out with them in a group with her and be civil and friendly and it\u2019s not a huge thing. We don\u2019t hate each other. It\u2019s just, nah. [0:08:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562010\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">So I ended up hanging out with this group \u2013 Matilda, Tracey, Lucy and Grey. Matilda and Tracey are married. Lucy is dating Tracey and she is Matilda\u2019s cousin and Grey has been best friends with Tracey for like 20 years since Grey was Tracey\u2019s babysitter and Tracey was a child. So like they adopted me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">They were like hey, hang out with us. So it was I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Cozy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: It was. It was very nice. I was shockingly not awkward. I was afraid I would feel like a fifth wheel like when they invited me to have brunch with them Saturday morning I thought, well I\u2019ll do breakfast with them. It will probably be awkward and then I\u2019ll disappear and find (unclear), Iris, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">Genevieve or Elsie to hang out with. But it wasn\u2019t. They were remarkably gracious in spite of the fact that they have decades, literally, of history with each other (unclear). [0:11:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">It was really weird. A completely different experience of a convention that I\u2019ve had before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You mean because you didn\u2019t (unclear) your usual panel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, I ended up attending all of Lucy\u2019s panels and about half of Tracey\u2019s panels. I mean, those four were often on the same panels. So I saw all of them on all the panels but mostly I was selecting for when there was a conflict on the one Lucy was on because she is incredibly smart. But it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">was a very different type of panel that I usually do. So they were on a bunch of the like lit crit panels and like let\u2019s compare such and such contemporary author to James Joyce and do like a literary analysis comparing contrasts or you know, (unclear) of Greek myth in contemporary science fiction and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">like so many of the classicists, Matilda\u2019s background is she\u2019s medieval European historian \u2013 not Matilda, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 Tracey. They just have a completely different background like a personal and academic, so you know, I typically will go to the panels about race and identity and anti-oppression because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200573\">those are those are the ones I get put on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">Those are the ones my friends are on and I want to support them because they\u2019re very important conversations and then when I\u2019m not on one of the panels I consider work. The ones I do for fun are usually science and tech related. So you know, let\u2019s talk about the latest developments in genetics and how <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">you can work it into your writing, like blah. So it was really weird in terms of the content that was consuming because it was not, I would have never put them together for a panel on \u2018Greek Myth Through the Ages\u2019. That doesn\u2019t interest me at all. But Lucy\u2019s a classicist and I was interested in listening <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">to Lucy, so there I was. And it was actually really interesting. I\u2019m glad I went.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">But also like my usual crowd that I run with if I can use such a phrase in that dimension \u2013 is mostly straight, mostly people of color. And this time I was hanging out almost exclusively with a group of white lesbians and it was just really different. People still stared at us but for different reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(Pause): [0:14:08 0:15:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Like did saying that bring you up short in some way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">(Pause): [0:15:09 0:15:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I apparently did because I\u2019ve stopped talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I was \u2013 are you familiar with the Yuletide fan fic writing exchange?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562010\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: So Yuletide happens every year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Around Christmas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Around Christmas, yes. It\u2019s an exchange where people fan fic for each other so you sign off what things you can write, what things you want to read and then you\u2019re matched with someone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s a circular exchange \u2013 A writes for B who writes for C and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Like Secret Santa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Except for fan fiction for obscure works, so not Star Trek or Harry Potter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: So if someone requested Lord Byron fan fiction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Lord Byron, like the poet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes. And so there actually was a ridiculous amount of Lord Byron fan fic this year. I don\u2019t know why. These things go in waves I guess. But there was one in particular that focused on Polidori who was Byron\u2019s physician and you know, Byron ran with a crowd of writers and poets, obviously. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">they were all remarkably talented. Like he was friends with Shelley. Polidori was his physician who traveled with him because he had (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Byron.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. He had to leave England because he was about to be thrown in, not jail, but wherever they put landed gentry who have crossed or violated their sexual codes because he slept with a bunch of married women and was accused of having been homosexual which was of course (unclear), I doubt at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">the time, which was how he wound up in Italy. But anyway they would do these readings and like dramatic presentations of plays they wrote and poor Polidori just desperately wanted to be a writer and would read utterly atrocious, like I\u2019ve seen a couple of samples of Polidori\u2019s work. It\u2019s really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) Byron and Shelley. [0:17:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Which is a little bit how I feel when I hang out with Lucy and Grey (unclear). And Grey who is, I don\u2019t know how to describe Grey except that she\u2019s very Grey. She\u2019s very eccentric but her writing is amazing. She\u2019s won several fairly big awards in the field. So yeah. And then there\u2019s me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: (Unclear).

It was created in the 19th Century and the person who designed it and cast it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">and used it in his press ended up throwing it all in the Thames because of an argument with his business partner. And that\u2019s very sad that (unclear) is lost forever. [0:19:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">He destroyed the original molds. Anyway, so we were talking about this because I had challenged Lucy to write a poem about it. And she said she would but only if I would write a poem about Medusa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: About Medusa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I can because she\u2019s a classicist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: She has a Ph.D. in Greek mythology for God\u2019s sake. Like, there is nothing that I could possibly say that I would be new or groundbreaking about Medusa. I\u2019d probably get it wrong because the version of the Medusa story that I know is the one from my 8th grade literature textbook which is probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">sanitized and not \u2013 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">(Pause): [0:20:06 0:20:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s really what matters in poems \u2013 historical accuracy and scholarly erudition.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562010\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Well, yes. In some sense. There\u2019s actually a poem I wrote that the editor of Mythic Delirium bought and it\u2019s going to come out in August. But I made significant and substantial changes to it after running it by a friend who is a scholar of the period I was writing about because (whispers). I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">had done my reading but I still got it wrong because Wikipedia is not factually scholarship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: As it turns out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: As it turns out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">(Pause): [0:21:08 0:21:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Though you\u2019re like being fairly self-critical, you\u2019re not entirely managing to convince me that you enjoy that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I do enjoy it. But it is also fraught with anxiety. I wish it wasn\u2019t.

Again, my point <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">isn\u2019t that you\u2019re in the wrong profession or you (unclear) be doing something else, it\u2019s that I could imagine that you would tend to see your own failures or anxiety, failings and anxieties more so than how much you happen to be enjoying what you\u2019re doing or what is or isn\u2019t doing for you as sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B52\">more than maintaining and doing something else that could be relevant.

We\u2019re in the early stages of a new project and a lot of things aren\u2019t defined and so there aren\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d be doing a lot of reading and stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s hard to stay focused on that so I actually have a task that I was supposed to have completed last Friday but I didn\u2019t. Actually, I took Monday off. So it\u2019s okay that I got nothing done Monday because that was a vacation day. And yesterday I tried to work on this project that should <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">have been done Friday and I did not get any traction on it. But it\u2019s an exploratory question like given \u2013 so there are these two designs that other teams in Dallas and Oregon are working on and we\u2019re going to work on the successor to that. But the first two designs \u2013 I\u2019m just going to tell you their <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">code names because it\u2019s easier. One is called K12 and the other is called Zen. And I\u2019m working on Tao. T-A-O.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: So K23 and Zen are also in early stages. Like so, look at K12, look at Zen. Look at their indirect target predictor. Figure out how they work and then if we make these changes to their target predictor, how much more power will that cost. And then I have like five questions of that style to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">answer. And it\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t know enough to understand how Zen and K12s work and they\u2019re actually coded. We don\u2019t even have code for ours and I don\u2019t know \u2013 so I could make a bunch of assumptions and just go and write some code that will scrape the metrics I need from their results database. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">I won\u2019t know if my answer is right and there is no way to check if my answer is right and I\u2019m terrified that it will be wrong and that I will look stupid. Which doesn\u2019t help me because not doing is also making me look bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562010\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I see.
