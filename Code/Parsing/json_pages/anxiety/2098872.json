But I somehow get out of bed and then it's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.

And I'm I'm hoping that I can keep it up after I get the bird feeder, because it is kind of a reward in itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: And I got a meditation cushion, which has made everything so much better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: And my sittings are like wildly different from each other. But they're there, which is great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause) What are you doing the same practices each time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I'm still like figuring out what my practices I mean, I set a I have this app that like sounds a bell, so I set that. And it's been between 25 and 45 minutes. And when I just sit and I sort of like settle in and then I focus on my breath and I keep coming back to it. And sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">I will like really, really not pay attention to thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: And sometimes I will and that will be the practice, or sometimes I will like feel like exploring, but not in a judgmental or attached way. Just sort of like, \u2018What are all the different aspects of this thought?'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: \u2018Is there a feeling?'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Sort of examining them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. And like maybe labeling them but you know that could like really quickly into a narrative -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: mode, which, I don't know. I could do that for like 45 minutes and not pay attention to even a single breath, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: I don't I don't want to do that. So I think the practice that I've been settle like that I've end up doing for most of the time is some combination of those two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Like alternating examining and just noticing, and then also like breathing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Like focusing on using your breathing as kind of a support for your meditation (inaudible)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then I sometimes I like will fall back on some Metta type phrases, but I don't know. Those are like sometimes really calming or sometimes they're sort of make me agitated. In general, I (pause) I think I'm like I don't know, less challenged by various different things, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">is nice. But and I think I can attribute that to a lot of like concrete changes in my relationship with Kelly and lab work and like strengthening my sense of self in my relationship with Jeremy and our home. Meditation, medication, therapy. But I I definitely still have these like little cycles <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200452\">of anxiety and depression or depressed they're sort of like depressive low mood cycles. And they come I don't know, they come like every three or four days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: And last for like 15 minutes to a couple of hours. And like they're getting further and further apart, but they're still they're very interesting. And I don't know when I tried to describe them to Jeremy, he asked if they were if the cycles were like thoughts or if they were feelings. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">And I I don't know that I can tell the difference between the two at that like during the episode.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098872\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: It's kind of like what happened in the car in Vermont on the way to that wedding, which is like this it seems sudden, a sudden like sense of panic. And like, \u2018Uh, do I really have to go on? Like, do I really have to keep on keeping on,' and it seems so long, it seems so tedious, so tiring. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">Like what is what are the good things, what are there any good things? And then like come and then like immediately like, \u2018What is this? These are scary thoughts. These are scary scary feelings.' And then like I notice myself really trying to change it or to act on it or to figure out, \u2018Ok, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">why now?' And I think my response to it is definitely changing and evolving, which is all I can do or all I feel that I want to do. But I wonder why it happens at all. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What was going on last time it happened? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Um um (pause) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Or I guess better yet, what was it about the car that seemed familiar about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I don't know, I guess I'm usually alone. It's usually some transition, like coming home from lab, or what this wasn't the last time it happened, but the time before that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I was driving to the dentist, and the day before Thanksgiving I think I was really nervous about going to the dentist, because I had I actually enjoyed getting my teeth cleaned, but I've had a lot of cavities over the last like four years, and never before that. So I was nervous about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">having more cavities. But I didn't really realize it until I left the dentist and I didn't have any cavities and it was a pleasant visit, and I felt like this great relief, and sort of like giddy with relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: But the thoughts or feelings didn't have anything to do with the dentist, it was just like almost like I was driving and I felt I just felt like really detached from where I was and what I was doing. And that didn't last very long because I was like had to talk to the dentist and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: And usually that interacting with people changes my mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: The last time it happened I don't really remember anything about it except that I was coming home from lab and just sort of like feeling really ho-hum about everything. And not and actually what happens is that I'm not able to like focus. It's almost this like hyper hyperactive state. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">I don't feel physically hyper, but my mind is like maybe triggered by some sort of sad or bad feeling and then I can't like calm down. I can't like visually focus like like there's all these like different -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Agitated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So the dream was like everybody was at our house, except it wasn't really our house. And I was getting ready and get the like getting ready part of the all the different wedding events were like so long, and I know that I feel badly that I spent so long having to get ready, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">like I really didn't care. And I just wanted to go and be with the people. So in this dream, basically, I missed like I delayed the wedding because I was getting ready and all these people all these women older women in my life were helping me. And I don't remember if my mom was there. My mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">feels she says that her one regret about the whole thing is that she didn't spend any time with me while I was getting ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Right before the wedding. And I when she brings it up she's brought it up a couple of times and I my reaction is like, \u2018What? That's dumb. Like you were doing such better stuff like greeting people and' but I just like I wonder why the getting ready part matters and if it has anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">to do with that, of why it keeps coming up in the dreams. So I was wearing like these really elaborate there was like the wedding and then the reception, and a different sari for each one. And someone I knew very well was like wrapping the sari on me, whereas at my real wedding, it was sort of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200812\">a community woman who is very good at it and gets hired to do it, but I didn't know her very well. And so I was late to the wedding, and then I guess the wedding happened. I don't remember that part of the dream. And then I had to spend like even more time getting ready for the reception. And I like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200813\">finally did and I was like loaded up with fabric, and we had to walk to the reception. And my cousins and my these like aunts and women in our family-friend circle were walking with me, and there was this like it had been raining. And the reception was like at the bottom of this hill and we had <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200814\">to like crabwalk like backwards crabwalk down the hill to get to the reception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: You mean like on your hands and feet? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: And everyone else was doing it everyone else was I don't know how they didn't get mud on their on themselves, but like I was the bride wearing like all of this jewelry and gorgeous fabric, and I was like crab walking down the hill. And the mud wasn't brown, it was like gray. And I remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">like thinking like, \u2018Oh, I'm not getting any mud on me. It's fine.' And then like I show up and I'm late to the reception, and my great friend (sp) is speaking, and Jeremy is like perched up on like this pedestal for like two people. And I'm like climbing this ladder to the pedestal with like mud on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200892\">my sari, like most of the way through her speech. And that was the dream. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Well, a couple of things that seem to recur involve your being on your way somewhere, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Like in the dream, both before the wedding and the reception.

And (pause) I think some sense of anticipation or frustration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Uh-huh. And also like a performative -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: quality to most of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Um I wonder one thought that occurs to me is whether or a question. There's something going on with the way that maybe you're like some ambivalence about these events -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: got split in time, since that the bad feelings, which may may be less acceptable. Like it's ok to have come up on your way there, like like you know you feel mixed about the dentist, and like having to get your teeth cleaned. On the other hand, you're worried about having more cavities <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">and whatever else. And you also know that once you get there, you're going to talk to the dentist and probably be nice to the dentist and hygienist or whoever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: And so I wonder and the word I wonder is \u2018crabby.' But the crabby (laughs) feelings kind of come out before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the first jazz rehearsal of the semester like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: but not really being able to process the feelings and just like totally breaking down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And when you get there I think both like kind of being pulled into things by the other people like by the social dimension of the situation -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: like I think probably for two reasons: one is like it's just kind of grounding to have the people around. And the other is I suspect it doesn't feel as ok to be cranky or unhappy about being there -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: in front of the other people, so you sort of shelve it a little bit. But it's also just generally kind of reassuring to or grounding to be around other -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: I think I I'm really I've always been really worried or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: placed a lot of importance on like showing up and doing a good job, or like, you know, giving it what I as much as I can give it or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: I don't know. Like when I speak with people, I I think Jeremy's grandmother I might have brought this up. She called me like said my greatest achievement is in my inner personal relations and it made and it was in the context of how I'm a great achiever, but that to her -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. What mattered most? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it in some sense it made me think of, \u2018Well, actually I'm like kind of an overachiever in in in my inner personal relations because I' I don't know. I'm sort of always like pushing and trying to connect and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: like feel really unsatisfied if I like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: haven't made a great effort to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: You have almost like a very strong sort conscience or judgementalness or something -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: around how you're how much of an effort you're making, how much you're trying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: Some of it I I've noticed because like I I scold Jeremy a lot for this these things that I consider my like I consider important to myself. Like early in our relationship I used to do it a lot, and it it's like totally a terrible thing to say to someone. And I think I really gave Jeremy <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">a complex for a while, and maybe he still has it. I mean, I think he has it anyway, but he's sort of a like a social underachiever -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098872\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: in that like he doesn't really like people other people that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Like he doesn't really look at strangers as an opportunity.

He would speak when spoken to, but wouldn't ask any questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: For years. And this was like such a point of shame for me that I was like bringing this guy into the house who already wasn't Indian, he already like took a year off from college, like he isn't he isn't like a stereotypical sort of achieving you know, he's not going to become a doctor or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F51\">a lawyer or I don't know. Like school was hard for him, but also he like I his IQ is like in the genius range, so he has this like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: and I just say that because because it is, I think and I think it's obvious, like when you speak with him, there's this incredibly smart person. But if you who's like functionality in the world is like a little bit off. So anyway, so I was aware of all of these things, and like on top <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F91\">of that, Jeremy just like wouldn't ask any questions. And my parents would would like notice it and say it to me, like \u2018He didn't ask me a single question.' And that was so painful. And I would like I would like have it out with Jeremy, like \u2018You have to ask questions.' And it was horrible. One <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F92\">thing that I real sort of realized over the break is that I have spent like seven years trying to like make Jeremy be acceptable to my family and trying to make him acceptable to me. And trying to make us, and our future, like possible, and like scheming and planning and hoping. And that's sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F93\">like over. Like all that energy is maybe still there, but it's not really like being directed in a in the same way at least. I brought it up to Jeremy and we sort of talked about how we could keep the scheming and planning and hoping in my life. But towards things that are relevant now, like a healthy <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F94\">relation a healthy marriage, or like you know, things that we want to do and accomplish together.

But it sounds like sometimes it's not necessarily clear to you the ways in which it so it can be uncomfortable or difficult or really require effort. I think a part of you kind of identified <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B1\">with the way he was and was reacting to him in probably a pretty similar way to how you would react to yourself, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: \u2018Come on.

And also there's I think I I mean, I want to make a good impression. (pause) And I think I can make a good impression.

Like you're don't I mean, I'm pretty naturally curious, but you don't just like deepen a relationship just like by like standing next to each other. I don't know, I'm always like thinking about where <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201251\">people are in their life and what they said yesterday and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: but I like to, I really like that aspect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Do you have a misanthropic heart?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: What does misanthropic mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Doesn't like people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: I haven't heard about it, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: I love people.
