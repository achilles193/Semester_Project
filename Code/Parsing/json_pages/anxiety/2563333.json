Well it makes me a real downer to talk to sometimes. But then I made a career of telling people what\u2019s wrong.

They\u2019re just there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: You just see them, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes, It\u2019s not like I\u2019m [inaudible at 00:02:03].

It\u2019s there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not really important. I don\u2019t really care how or why you torn the corner of that book cover or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: But it enters your thinking. It\u2019s prominent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yes, you can say prominent I suppose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Or more It\u2019s not <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: No, I think prominent\u2019s the right word. It\u2019s interesting, though. It\u2019s interesting since I noted it. Have you been able to give any thought to meeting with Ginny and how we might make that work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I needed, I probably need to talk to Josh just to make sure that a Monday morning will work. And then I probably want to make sure that I don\u2019t have or if I had a noon appointment on Monday that I scheduled them a little bit later so they would get there early.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Okay. Sure, yes, because we usually meet at 11:00 right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yes. So if they get there a quarter of and we\u2019re still talking, we\u2019re not [inaudible at 00:03:32].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Right, right. That\u2019s about as usual. I understand. All right, well thank you for looking into it. I appreciate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yes, what are your thoughts been about it? Or have you had any more ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: No, I think it\u2019s great. I was talking to my sister and I said yes, whatever Ginny wants to do it makes sense. And she said yes, it makes a lot of sense that Ginny would want that, a support member for herself. I said, yes [inaudible at 00:04:04] come down and said they can\u2019t be in the office <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">where I meet Carl. She said, why? I said because that\u2019s mine. That\u2019s mine. There\u2019s a lot of things that happen that are mine that Ginny has no view into. She doesn\u2019t have any knowledge of my Internet girlfriends and then I\u2019m not sure this is a word we use. It\u2019s not really my girlfriend. She\u2019s a cam <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">girl; she\u2019s a sex worker. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">You don\u2019t really know anything about them really. But I remember my Internet girlfriend in Belarus. They work in studios in the Belarus. It\u2019s funny, the ones that doesn\u2019t speak English very well you can hear someone sometimes prompting them on the English things to say and your responses to them some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">of them are typed, which is kind of like okay, enough, good bye. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: You know there\u2019s somebody else there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes. This is all a show. And it\u2019s all a show and the one in Belarus it\u2019s sincere about the show. She understands the work. She\u2019s like this is a job I\u2019ve got to do. This is a job I get to but also there is importance from what I do. To draw on an analogy it\u2019s the difference between you and Sonny. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">I\u2019m in care of a buyer; I\u2019m in the care industry. And he\u2019s there because it\u2019s a school for it and this is the job he has. You\u2019re here because you went to school for it but you went through with the intention of helping people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yes, that there\u2019s, yes. There\u2019s a professional component to it but that\u2019s for some people it can be removed of the kind of the caring for other people that\u2019s imbedded in it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And those are the ones who are worthwhile? And then you are, I mean being totally pragmatic, useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well you see it in Ginny too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes, well she\u2019s finally got that new job, which is why we have insurance again. But yes, I mean she was there to be useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Why did you move? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: She was there to be useful but, but nothing. She was there to be useful. They drove her out of it. Something about the corporate side of it being useless and that\u2019s why the turnover in that place was so rapid. Well not, I say turnover if they were hiring people to replace those who left. In <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">fact, what they had was very little retention rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yes, and then people would just be slammed with [inaudible at 00:07:47].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. Ginny had two job but economics paid for one. And she still used to be available for some per diem stuff from them. But more often than not she said you know what actually? No, I\u2019m not going to do it. So that guy I told you about I met going through [inaudible at 00:08:15] company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: He had a [inaudible at 00:08:15]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: He, I may have told you this, no I didn\u2019t, he got back around Tuesday morning. Quick e-mail said yes, it was great meeting you too. He said looking over your resume it looks like you\u2019re skilled in half of [inaudible at 00:08:35], so what sort of role are you looking for? I finally said to myself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">Fred I\u2019m that way so don\u2019t make any issues about how I address myself I said to myself, self you\u2019ve gotten in trouble before for being too humble so let\u2019s just be direct instead. I said Viggo, that\u2019s an excellent question. I\u2019m really looking to fill any role which you need me for. The very first <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">thing you should let me do is build your plant, regardless of whatever else you hire me for. I can do that as a consultant or as a full-time hire. As a consultant, give me three to six months, boom, I\u2019ll build you a fully functioning team, make you [inaudible at 00:09:23] and I\u2019ll be on my way. I said <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200573\">however, hire me full-time I\u2019ll do the exact same thing but it\u2019ll be a lot more use out of me if you keep me around. I said, specifically you\u2019ll get the most use out of me if you give me some amount of autonomy and access the high level decision making. That\u2019s where I\u2019m useful to you. Work at the executive <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200574\">level, I\u2019m fine working with executives, blah, blah, blah. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I said if that all sounds valuable to me, fantastic, if valuable to you, fantastic; let me know. If not, no hard feelings. I said here\u2019s a list of people you know, you can talk to about me. Here\u2019s a couple other people that you may or may not know who\u2019ll act as professional references. Let me know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">you want to do. That three to six months in there throws people sometimes. It did at [] (ph). Sit down at an interview with Larry, the General Manager, and Oliver, one of the executives and they said so how long did it take you to build a team? I said three months and Oliver said I kind of figured I\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">do it in a month. I said you don\u2019t want that team. I said that\u2019s not a good team. And I was right. And he and I went back and forth on this. We never fought about it but we went back and forth. He had this team and it was pretty cheap $10 a day for four guys. I remember one day Josh being on the phone <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200593\">with him, Josh turns to me and says Fred, Oliver wants to do something and you\u2019re telling me that hiring 200 people here is better than hiring 30. I said, yes. I said you can also add that that\u2019s based on six years of experience doing exactly this. He said should I say that? I said yes, absolutely say <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200594\">that. He says okay, Fred says the following. And that was it. Shot down, hired two more people, it was over. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yes, I mean it\u2019s like doing any, anybody there asking to do a job you can say there\u2019s a cheap way to do it and there\u2019s the right way to do it and the right way costs a little more and takes more time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yes, cost more. But it can get the job right; it can. But in some cases I can give you fast, or rather, I can give you fast and I can give you effective if you want those two things. That means you\u2019ll have to pay more money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019ll save you money in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly. Or I can give you fast and I can give you cheap. You get two of the three; you always can get two of the three. If you\u2019re really, really, really lucky you can get two of the three. It\u2019s always two of the three.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And what, do they have some venture capital behind them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yes, they\u2019re funded all the way through next year. So I mean they\u2019re, they can handle it. They can handle me hiring three more testers. And the thing is too, people say oh maybe, and that\u2019s what they think. They say oh man maybe we should outsource. You should never outsource. It\u2019s fucking video <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">safe. Unless you absolutely have to. And the fact that we [inaudible at 00:12:57] say you probably don\u2019t really have to. This is what they talk about oh we don\u2019t know what to do with automation. You know exactly what to do with automation. You do with automation what you would do with those 30 dudes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">you hire in Montana and that you pay $20 an hour for because they\u2019re being paid $10. And I can fix it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">Funny thing, so I was supposed to, I\u2019m still going to, go to an orientation today at Concord where they\u2019ll teach me how to the self-directed learning center I did last year, last semester no last year. And I said yes, I\u2019ll sit down and do some of the homework while I\u2019m there just so I can get my three <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">hours in for the week and meet with my professor for 15 minutes, which will be about 2 seconds or whatever. And when I\u2019m on the bus I said I forgot my bag, my bag with the book in it, the notebook, with my anxiety meds for the afternoon, I forgot all those things. I said but you know what, I can still <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">go. I\u2019ll just go, I\u2019ll do the orientation, I\u2019ll meet with the dude, might be a video lecture I can watch on the computer, and then I\u2019ll sign out and go home. 0317329 that is on the student ID number, as it turns out. 037329 that\u2019s not right. 0317, there it is, 329. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: How was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Oh I\u2019m going today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Oh you mean you were on a bus here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I was on the bus here, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: You could\u2019ve.

I was just going to get some stuff done while I was there. I started reading the book again last night. We have to do Sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 this week and there aren\u2019t really many problems in 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. They\u2019re mostly discussions of problems and questions on how you would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">approach those problems, basically a definition of terms.

I said okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I figure you\u2019re going to like statistics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yes, I do already. I mean ordering those statistics. These things out here you put in order but their relevant values do not matter. For instance, I rank 3rd in my class, I rank 25th, I rank 50th, I rank 13th. Okay, we can put you in the quarter but their number doesn\u2019t actually matter because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">they\u2019re so far away from the others the distance between isn\u2019t important. All we want to know is which student is better than which. We\u2019re not concerned with how much better. In fact, in a sample size of maybe 1,000 students or 5,000, which is found in Amherst High School those numbers are meaningless. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">It\u2019s like 50th out of 5,000, okay so I\u2019m near the top. Three hundred out of five thousand, that\u2019s still really good probably. Those numbers are meaningless. First out of five thousand that\u2019s an important number. [inaudible at 00:16:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You mean the actual number itself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. But in terms of first through fiftieth, they\u2019re probably not that different from each other. Fiftieth through two hundredth also probably not that different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting that the number itself doesn\u2019t matter except in terms of where the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Right, yes, what the context is. Nothing matters but the context. The context is how you rate the students in terms of [inaudible at 00:16:58] best to worst, simple. Super simple. So anyway, end of story is I\u2019ve got the name of the other, some of the other ones. These ones are like the, where <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">the value is more important. You put them in order that their value is extremely important when you need to know specifically how much better this is than that is. [inaudible at 00:17:22] Just different ways of looking at numbers in Math. I was lying in bed with Ginny yesterday, after we had sex actually, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">and we were talking about something and she said how\u2019s the statistics book? And I said it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s mostly 37.5% word problems. And she said it\u2019s dressed in that bullshit with statistics? I said yes. Just making up numbers. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">Like the thing one in five people go hungry, look around. What a ridiculous thing to add at the end of that number. One in five, so 20% of the population goes hungry. Okay, that\u2019s an important statistic but not right here in Georgetown. I\u2019m not going to look around Georgetown -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And see one in five, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: and say one in five.

That\u2019s interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Right, but one in five, yes because it\u2019s context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Yes. Without context it\u2019s nothing. And yes, that was in the first chapter I was reading. I said okay great. Yes, so yes, I think I\u2019m going to like it too. I think I\u2019m going to like it too.

I need about another <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">60,000 words and I\u2019ll have a young adult novel. I checked this. I went looking for a book vocation online to see what they say about novel book length. They said if you want to write romance novels, anything between 50,000 and 70,000 words is fine, anything over that they don\u2019t want to look at it. Looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200992\">for a fantasy novel 100,000 to 150,000 words is fine.

I said Rita you have a book deal and an agent, how did that whole thing work? Then I have this sense that I always have where I say it\u2019ll work the first time. But you know I\u2019ll just say boom, here\u2019s my book. They say oh it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">a good book. I want to make a movie deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: What did she do?

She said hey I\u2019ve written a couple different trilogies, so based on the strength of these she said yes, okay, why don\u2019t you write a book? What\u2019s your idea? It\u2019s this. Okay, great. Let\u2019s do that. And from that she got a movie deal and then boom. If it\u2019s good you\u2019ll have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">no problem.

Harry Potter for fuck\u2019s sake. Although, the book isn\u2019t quite long (ph). Look at Harry Potter book one. It\u2019s a pretty short book it\u2019s about 80,000 words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yes. And as the series goes on, the books get longer and longer. It\u2019s about an 800-page book at the end, which I read in 8 hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Which would be how many words?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: In one sitting. Oh God, I couldn\u2019t even tell you.

I have no idea. I have no idea. It\u2019s small print in that book. I don\u2019t know how many pages, I don\u2019t know how many words are on a page. But it was a lot. It\u2019s a fucking epic. And, yes, 800 pages in 8 hours; 100 pages an hour in a book that size. In a normal <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">sized book I read about a page in a minute, which someone once told me was fast. It might be fast. I think I read pretty quickly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yes, I mean I devour books. People say here\u2019s a book; I say oh this is good. That was really good. Harry Potter in one sitting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: In one sitting like it was my day job because I just did not want to hear [inaudible at 00:23:11] format.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yes, visual processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yes, I\u2019m good at that. I\u2019m good at that. But so I\u2019m writing and I realize that what I\u2019m writing would actually make a great young adult movie. I\u2019ve got three main characters, all of whom are women and quite unintentionally two of which as it turns out as I read it are lovers, as I wrote it rather. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">It just, it just happened. Next thing I know oh okay that\u2019s definitely what\u2019s going on, okay. But then I have these ideas for scenes I know need to have them in the book to make it work. I don\u2019t know how to get from beginning to the end so I\u2019m just writing whatever scene I think of and I\u2019ll put them <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD2\">all in order as necessary. And I\u2019ve been developing the third character into more of her own character, giving chapters from her perspective. Which what I really like about the book is that each character has a unique way they view the world. And that shows through in their chapters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">Maggie, when I was Maggie, through Maggie\u2019s eyes, everything is pragmatic; everything is a problem to be solved or killed. And patience; she sees the world the way it is. She has no extra special senses. She has, all she has is this God backing her up, this God with no name. But she\u2019s just a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: You know you\u2019re pretty good area to be if you want to really do something with this, you\u2019re in a good area for I bet there\u2019s a lot of you\u2019re not your problem isn\u2019t kind of creative, the actual creative part. It\u2019s much more like well how do you, if you want to make a go of it how do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">you do it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: How do I, yes. Who do I give this to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: But this is the best area in the world for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: This area here? Probably yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yes. Georgetown and Providence and there are so many -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Publisher businesses?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot of publishing here and a lot of people that want to publish.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: That\u2019s cool. And if nothing else, I can always put it on Amazon for five bucks as a Kindle book. And so I have this with Erin, Erin sees the world quite differently. She\u2019s a she\u2019s her training is in composure and restraint. And the [inaudible at 00:26:14] that I\u2019ve worked out for her is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">attunement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well so every faction involves a magic system. How does magic work in this universe? It has to be explained and it\u2019s different for various people. Maggie\u2019s stuff comes through this God that occasionally lets her do these incredible feats like strength and whatnot. Whereas Erin, Erin is all training <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">and hereditary; you can only be what she is if you were born. So it\u2019s rare and one great themes that I want to bring up is early on is the fact that she comes from a long line of heart seekers what they call them. But her parents love her and accept her but still fret about the fact that she won\u2019t be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E32\">having any children because she\u2019s a Lesbian she won\u2019t be having any children. So there\u2019s one less mind and one line of heart seekers that dies out because she\u2019s an only child. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">But the whole thing about her is about heartbeats, feeling, sensing other heartbeats. And steel has resonance to it. And in this world what I let her do is she attunes steel to the heart and something else, so the sword actually seeks the heart directly. Makes her very dangerous, agile and quick in <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">the book. I let her do cool things like bounce off of parts and pull herself towards them. Yes and so when I write about her there\u2019s a sense of these pulses and how she sees things and what she hears. She can hear metal around her because it sings to a degree. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Because metal is attuned to the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Well she attunes the resonance like a tuning fork for the potential sound, the potential resonance of the it\u2019s magic, I don\u2019t have to science it too much. Whereas Bethany (sp) the last one is just straight out of wizardry gallery, she uses magic. But [inaudible at 00:28:49] of writing chapters <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E91\">from her point of view she sees things nobody else can see. She sees an actual connection between Maggie and Erin, like an actual cord that runs between them. There\u2019s a great scene where Maggie gets killed at the end and that cord snaps, just kind of flaps in the wind in front of her face whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E92\">I wrote the final scene where Erin is leaving and she\u2019s packing stuff to leave, she\u2019s going AWOL, she\u2019s going out past the frontier into the wild. Bethany is watching her and she sees Erin holding this knife. And a pulse goes out, everyone\u2019s heart pulses goes out from her and it\u2019s the necklace. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E93\">this brief flash of that cord from Maggie\u2019s necklace back to her and it fades and is [inaudible at 00:29:41].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">And I always liked that image like this is an actual memento, this is something that actually, you can still feel that connection if only momentary, if only for along the same thing, it\u2019s a taste of what\u2019s human. But I have this scene early on in the book where Maggie, [inaudible at 00:30:06] teams, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB1\">incredible, skilled, superhero teams essentially, and Bethany is really trying to work her way into being accepted part of. But the team is all separated, Maggie\u2019s very badly damaged by this hemp trap she ran into where she\u2019s cut and broken her sore arm, she doesn\u2019t remember that yet. She\u2019s cut and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB2\">dazed and confused. And there\u2019s this person coming to kill her and [inaudible at 00:30:36] Erin jumps in and there\u2019s this fight between her and the other guy. And Maggie realizes this other guy\u2019s actually better than Erin and it\u2019s made worse by the fact that Erin\u2019s trying to protect Maggie who\u2019s incapacitated. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB3\">And the other guy knows it so he says fantastic, so all I have to do is continue trying to maneuver in such a way to get to her and you are effectively now up against the wall, you cannot back up any further so now I have even more [inaudible at 00:31:06] advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">And Erin gets a small cut and another small cut and anyone who, if you trained with knife stuff at all you know the first time you get cut you\u2019re losing [inaudible at 00:31:19] and you\u2019re losing very quickly because blood is pouring and you\u2019re bleeding. You\u2019re bleeding to the point where you\u2019re losing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">energy. So Maggie\u2019s trying to get herself up, she\u2019s trying to grab her sword but her arm doesn\u2019t work and she\u2019s trying to save her. She says I need you to save her because Erin is losing. Erin\u2019s losing because she won\u2019t give up on Maggie, she won\u2019t give up on her. And finally Erin makes a mistake, just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED2\">a very small one but enough to let the other guy just take a stab and then potentially drop a side kick into her ribs, crack a couple, throw her against the wall. She collapses and Maggie\u2019s just thinking through he\u2019s going to kill her; he\u2019s going to kill her. She thinks it\u2019s going to be my fault; it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED3\">all my fault because I couldn\u2019t save her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">And so eventually I have her she charges into this guy, gets him at the right moment, tackles him. And he\u2019s still trying to roll her over and she knows she knows that she\u2019s been through this training drill a million times. She thinks he\u2019s going to roll me and he\u2019s going to cut my throat and I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">to die. And so she\u2019s also getting cuts, she\u2019s been fighting back vomiting this entire time. So at this moment, the thing where before she gets rolled she actually just vomits right into his face, which distracts him long enough for her to start just bringing her sore arm down. It\u2019s a metal bracer so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF2\">she\u2019s just slamming in his face over and over again, talking about how he, his head just bouncing off the floor, his head is bouncing off the floor as it cracks. She hits him; his head doesn\u2019t bounce anymore and she hits him again and she looks at this wrecked face with massive blood and vomit, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF3\">broken and collapsed face which is a mass of blood and vomit. And she has time to think that\u2019s gross before she passes out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: And then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: The rest of it\u2019s great death where she\u2019s fading in and out of consciousness and Erin says stutter stop speaking because her ribs are broken and it\u2019s hard for her to actually draw breath without [inaudible at 00:33:37]. And she\u2019s trying to keep Maggie awake and she\u2019s fading in and out of consciousness. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">And at one point she\u2019s being carried, the wizard is magically carrying them both out of the cave whatever they\u2019re in, and Maggie wakes up for a moment and she notices she\u2019s being carried, she can see the rock walls. She can hear Erin\u2019s voice, that same stutter stop where she was saying if you let her <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F32\">die I\u2019ll find you, I swear I\u2019ll find you. And whatever talk there is but she\u2019s addressing directly the God that\u2019s connected with Maggie. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">And the final scene, Erin\u2019s packing to go, to leave forever and Bethany\u2019s says do you know where you\u2019re going to go? They\u2019re going to give you leave, they\u2019ll give you as much leave as you need. She says I\u2019m not taking a leave. She says are you transferring, you\u2019re transferring? That makes me the highest <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F51\">ranking person here and I\u2019m not fit for command. She says you are now; you\u2019re fine. Just look at everything we did. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without you. We\u2019re going to push the frontier forward here; we\u2019ll absorb the mountains to the collective end. Bethany\u2019s trying to talk through it and Erin <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F52\">keeps talking about promises. And she says you balk at the chance to make God, that\u2019s a promise. And in the previous scene, which I haven\u2019t written yet, the God uses Maggie to kill something that she wanted to kill and she does so by sacrificing her to it, which is not typical. gods don\u2019t usually use <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F53\">up their champions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">So Maggie gets killed, sacrificed by the God to accomplish this task. So Erin\u2019s talking about promises, promises that have to be kept. And Bethany\u2019s occasionally trying to interject otherwise quality things and other things, and Erin says you want to see something? And she pulls out a sword, she pulls <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">it out [a bit] (ph) and there\u2019s a scripture on the blade that says forever. And she said Maggie got that for me for my birthday. She said did I ever tell you that we met on my birthday? And she tried to make it a secret but I felt her leave the room so I just told her I loved it because I love her. Forever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">And I always have her talking about Maggie in the present tense. Not this when people do my father is, was, none of that business she\u2019s always talking about her as if she\u2019s still around. And she says if you make a promise you keep it. She said this word is a promise that said everything you already <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F91\">were. And she said so I keep my promises. So eventually the scene goes on and they\u2019re saying their goodbyes and Bethany says I\u2019m going to miss you. I\u2019ll miss you too but I have a god to kill. And then she goes. And then if there\u2019s an extra, a second book, it\u2019s Erin hunting down a god. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Well I can tell your mood by just the it\u2019s a good story. What does it mean to you? It\u2019s something like it\u2019s almost like it has a life of its own and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: Well books do that. If you talk to a lot of writers they can do that. I\u2019ve heard it before and I started writing and I said oh shit, it just happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: It emerged from you but it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: Yes. I created these people and they behave in particular ways. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: What does it mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I love the idea of, I love the idea of we made a promise to each other. They get married essentially; they\u2019re married to each other. And it\u2019s scrimption (ph), it\u2019s a symbol for that promise. And it\u2019s about betrayal, that sense of betrayal. Like there was a promise made that wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">kept; and I made a promise and she says and I\u2019m keeping it. So now I have to go find this God; now I have to kill it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yes, like one promise almost is I don\u2019t know if it counters the other promise but it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s a betrayal from the God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s like you were supposed to protect her. That was your job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">THERAPIST: But the bond of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:39:09], yes. It\u2019s the same thing. gods, gods choose a champion. We\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s a funny book because a scene earlier in there where this gnome has been sent to this part of the frontier because they have reason to leave there are ruins of other gnomish cultures beyond <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D1\">the frontier in which is called the wild. And he\u2019s trying to petition to the council which is the ruling body to have a team of heroes sent out to because that\u2019s they\u2019re job, the folk heroes get sent out to retrieve these various cultural artifacts and everything in these monster-infested caves and whatnot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">And he finds out that they\u2019re both low-ranking, Maggie and Erin are both low-ranking, and he says I can\u2019t believe I can\u2019t believe they sent me to you. This is ridiculous. This is a dangerous thing and important and not just to me but to my people and it\u2019s irresponsible that they would send you. I understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F1\">you have a heart seeker with you too and you two are duo status, which means they cannot be deployed separately; they are officially a team. And Maggie says yes but we also have a wizard, at which point she flips out because they\u2019re ranked three, which is pretty low, one being the highest, and it seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F2\">if Maggie ranks three and is in charge then the wizard must be ranked one or two. And he\u2019s flipping out mortality rates. He doesn\u2019t notice that the dragon\u2019s the mortality rates of wizards are very high at low levels, they don\u2019t survive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">THERAPIST: Easily killed, very easily killed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">CLIENT: Very easily killed, yes. And so he says you\u2019re responsible, [inaudible at 00:41:15]. He says do you know, have any idea what the mortality rates are? She slams her fist down and says that\u2019s it, and she starts rattling off mortality rates of wizards. She ranked one wizard 87% mortality rate in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201131\">the field drops to 75% rank two; sharp drop of 63% at rank three, 50% at rank 4, 39% at rank 5. After that it just gets better. She said our wizard is rank five and he says well why isn\u2019t she in charge? It\u2019s none of your fucking business why she\u2019s not in charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">And so it\u2019s getting heated between them and then Erin\u2019s been in the back of the room the entire time. And I love the way Erin talks. She says but sir Maggie\u2019s angry because the things you are saying are stupid and offensive, that\u2019s all. And he didn\u2019t  oh surprise, surprise. And she said be calm. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201151\">she had pen whipped (ph) Maggie notices that he does calm; immediately. He relaxes because the trick she seen less of it than before. She attunes his heart rate to hers, which is calmer. So he calms down. And, yes but there\u2019s a bit afterwork in there where she says I\u2019m a champion. Do you know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201152\">the mortality rates on champions? And he stammers and she says 0%. Champions don\u2019t die on the field because they don\u2019t because gods make a promise. They make a bond. Champions don\u2019t die on the field; they die of old age. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">There\u2019s lots of big deals, there\u2019s lots of big deals, and a lot of the sub plots that are going on that the ladies aren\u2019t aware of most of the time is this war between the ocean and the wild. I have this rule set up where the ocean, the coast respectively infinite, up and down, the ocean continually <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201171\">wears away the coast faster than normal, than what we\u2019d expect. So every year the ocean moves a little bit closer. The ocean is described as hungry, impatient. And in front of them, beyond the frontier is the wild. And out in the wild there are monsters and treasure and gold and all sorts of valuable <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201172\">precious metals which as it turns out people can use to make magical enchanted things. Which answers the question that so many almost failed to mention well is this is a 1,000-year-old culture. Thousands of years and why hasn\u2019t anyone invented the steam engine, sort of that. And the answer is because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201173\">they don\u2019t have to; they have magic that takes care of a lot of those things. Why invent a steam engine when you don\u2019t need that. You\u2019ve enchanted waters to run down these pipes. You can enchant the water to a particular temperature. And lists (ph) of people are sent out into the wild to clear it of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201174\">dangerous things, to gather the precious metals that exist out there, bring them back into the frontier. And then the frontier moves forward a little bit more every year as the ocean chases them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20119\">And so the ocean the wild before us the ocean behind us, so this is the process to train heroes to go into the frontier. Heroes can kill monsters, heroes can bring back treasures and treasure fuels the collective. The collective runs from the ocean because the ocean is hungry. And at eight years old <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201191\">Maggie, she almost falls because once she determines she has to, she realizes there\u2019s a good scene where she\u2019s out there, she\u2019s eight years old, and she\u2019s thinking about I\u2019m my mom told me not to come out to the cliffs, it\u2019s dangerous. But she\u2019s eight years old, she\u2019s not a baby any more, I\u2019m told <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201192\">what to do, blah, blah, blah. And she\u2019s walking on the cliffs and she falls. And she\u2019s barely holding on. And she\u2019s screaming out for help and then she\u2019s sorry. She\u2019s sorry she came out here. She\u2019s sorry, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be here and she\u2019s sorry she came out here. And she\u2019s about to cry because <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201193\">she realizes no one, no one knows she\u2019s here. No one\u2019s looking for her. No one is going to save her so she decides to save herself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011B\">That\u2019s the defining moment of her childhood. She realizes that she had to save herself and so she does which is afterwards when that God makes contact with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Well, yes, that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011F\">CLIENT: And their God is the ocean, it\u2019s a force from the ocean. It\u2019s in line at least with the ocean and it needs to get something to us out of the frontier, to the wild so it can certainly do damage in the wild for some reason which I\u2019ll figure out. Most of the entire time the God has used her the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2011F1\">entire time he spent. So in the sequel <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20121\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at ] it\u2019s almost psychological kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20123\">CLIENT: Sure it\u2019s a great scene, makes people cry. Makes people cry when they read it. It\u2019s quite good, one of the better ones. I only wrote it after I\u2019d written a bunch of other stuff. And when I wrote that scene, I said ah, oh gosh I\u2019m getting good at this now. Time to go back and rewrite the first <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201231\">three chapters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20125\">THERAPIST: How was the talking about it in your week ?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20124-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20124-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563333\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20127\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. We talked about it in general. It\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s a book about my deepest beliefs. Maggie is completely about self-reliance; Erin is completely about self-control but at the same time this sort of endless love that is returned by this other person who is somewhat emotionally crippled <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201271\">but less so in the presence of Erin. And this third person from the outside who just wants to fit into it and is eventually let in and now that changes her. And how she begins the story unfit for command, she\u2019s too flighty, she\u2019s too emotional. But by the end of it she has accomplished all these things <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201272\">at the end of it; she\u2019s a fucking brain 10 wizard by this one and as Erin points out they need you here now. And they\u2019re going to send you farther and you\u2019re going to be all right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20129\">And the sequel if there is a sequel, switchback from what Bethany\u2019s doing on the frontier and what Erin\u2019s doing in the wild. Maybe [inaudible at 00:48:35] bring Maggie back because I have to but only after Erin finds the God and the God begs for his life. He says I can bring her back to you, bring her <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201291\">back to you, bring her back to you. And she says bring her back. She says you have to promise you won\u2019t kill me. Without hesitation, she says I promise. And so the God brings Maggie back, where then Erin is there holding her sword still in the gods heart because of the promise, the promise. She says <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201292\">Maggie want to push this sword in for me? She keeps her promise; she always keeps her promises. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2012B\">There\u2019s a lot of brutality. The fight scenes are really good. Maggie is brutal; Erin is perfect and graceful. There\u2019s a point where Bethany\u2019s about to be killed. It\u2019 was pretty sure; Maggie is a prominent fuck, now I\u2019m going to stay with the fucking wizard again, trying to fight her way to her, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2012B1\">sword\u2019s trying to strangle (ph) her to that. Bethany\u2019s got this spell where she distends her jaw and bites the front half of his skull off. In the scene later, we were all drinking in the tavern they said that was so great; you did it so great. It tasted disgusting; I know it must have, right? You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2012B2\">so cool right now.
