So we have an apartment in a very old house and the landlord is this Greek guy from a village near Sparta where they make olive oil and he came in the late \u201860s I think. He\u2019d been an officer in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">army and you know, most immigrants who came just worked and had shit wages for many years. But what Nick did that is unique in my knowledge and would certainly be impossible today was while making $7 an hour as a house painter he bought a house in Westchester Port \u2013 a triple decker, that is, our triple <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">decker, and I think they\u2019re still pretty close to the margin in terms of their capacity to absorb unexpected expenses. Maybe that\u2019s a bargaining position on his part \u2013 I don\u2019t know. But they still live in the building. At any rate it\u2019s a very old house and he keeps it up entirely himself and hasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">changed the pipes since he bought it, I\u2019m sure \u2013 meaning that all the pipes are the original pipes and all the pipes have all this shag on the inside which catches anything that goes through them, so clogs are not infrequent. So any time there\u2019s a clog, instead of calling the plumber or whatever, Nick, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">this 75-year old comes up sometimes with his wife and an acetylene torch to deal with it. So yesterday my mother-in-law came in on an emergency basis because [Jennie] (ph) and I were just totally exhausted. She was staying in one of the spare bedrooms. And should say that we absolutely adore this apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D5\">despite all its idiosyncrasies, in part because not only do we have our own bedroom, we also each have an office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s way below market and its location is wonderful. We\u2019re really, we\u2019re really, really happy there. So I\u2019m telling you this partly because I\u2019m in a stream of consciousness mood and partly because it\u2019s relevant to this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: So Jennie\u2019s mother-in-law came down from Yale on the train to help us out. We\u2019re having a naming ceremony for Grayson on Sunday and so my mother and sister and family, all of the family are coming down for this thing. So she\u2019s going to come down on Saturday. So among the various services she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">providing is washing our dishes which is nice because among other things the pipes are too bad in this apartment to get a dishwasher so I\u2019ll wash them manually. She starts washing the dishes and nothing goes down the drain. I\u2019m like \u2013 \u2018oh fuck.\u2019 I said, \u2018okay, I\u2019m going out to Rite-Aid, I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">get some Drain-O.\u2019 And we\u2019ve done this a million times before because I hate calling the landlord. He\u2019s 75 freaking years old and, hale and hearty and all \u2013 it\u2019s a clog. So I went to the drugstore and I got some Drain-O and I put it in the drain and I\u2019m feeling kind of lousy because I spend so much <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">time and energy getting this place perfect \u2013 ready for my son \u2013 you know the drains. So I put in the Drain-O after breakfast and you sit there and let it work for 30 minutes, come back and uniquely in my experience it has not gone down. In other words, the clog is so intense that the Drain-O has bubbled <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">up into our (unclear) sink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Ooh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. So like, it\u2019s like this like scum of foam of Drain-O. I could see what Drain-O does when it\u2019s working. It just came right back at me. I\u2019m like \u2018fuck.\u2019 Now what do I do? And I even want this concentrated Drain-O to remain in the sink so the first effort to flush it which was fruitless \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">just put hot water into the sink \u2013 which would at the very least it would \u2013 nothing. It didn\u2019t go anywhere. I was like, \u2018fuck, I can\u2019t leave this thing. My son\u2019s over there, we\u2019re over here.\u2019 There are fumes, etc. So I went under the sink and there\u2019s a \u2013 because it\u2019s so old it has copper pipes, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">there\u2019s like a little petcock an inch in diameter that you remove to snake it. So I put a bucket-ish basin underneath it and this would have been enough for what was in the sink but I wasn\u2019t reckoning on the fact that there was water all the way up to the clog and Drain-O. So it all came rushing down <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">and overflowing into the bottom of the sink, this toxic mixture of water and Drain-O. It overflowed the basin. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561398\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">So it\u2019s all pouring onto our kitchen floor. And I\u2019m like \u2018Jesus fuck,\u2019 and you can imagine the scene. I was saying, \u2018get the kid out of the living room!\u2019 (Laughs) Then I sat there just fuming in many senses of the word. I mopped up the kitchen floor as best I could with some fucking towels. Got out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">our little snake and started to snake this motherfucker out and I can\u2019t remember what made me swear as loudly as I could possibly swear but at a certain point the landlord who was downstairs, heard me and he was like \u2013 he uses this kind of language sometimes in extremis and he was like, \u2018Galen, what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">the fuck are you doing? Why didn\u2019t you call me?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Nick, I didn\u2019t want to call -\u2019 whatever. You can imagine the scene.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: So he starts working on it and he can\u2019t make any progress. He gets this gigantic, full-sized plumber\u2019s snake from downstairs. He gets this little snake with the \u2013 you know, that fits into the drill, you know, and he tries to drill it out and nothing is happening. After two hours of that he says, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">\u2018my wife and I have our physical examinations,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Nick, get to your goddamn exam and come back later.\u2019 He comes back with his wife \u2013 so these two 75-year old people in our kitchen trying to get rid of the goddamn clog and he gets his acetylene torch and he undoes the weld on the copper pipes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">and he looks in the junction and he clears it out and he says, \u2018oh, I think it\u2019s down in the main drain.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Nick, it\u2019s not down in the main drain. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. If it was in the main drain you wouldn\u2019t have any drainage here.\u2019 It just wasn\u2019t making any sense at all. (Laughs) So there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">these two crazy people in my kitchen and I\u2019m like, \u2018call the plumber.\u2019 And he says \u2013 he goes into this long story about how he came to his country and was making $7 an hour. Anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">So they had to be in our kitchen for four hours. Him for three hours and his wife for another hour. And he\u2019s like (laughs) he got a piece of rope and he had us \u2013 we lowered it down to his wife who was standing by the hose spigot, you know, the attachment for the hose onto the rope so he could pull it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">up and flush the drain to see if it was moving. It was just like an episode of \u201cAll In the Family.\u201d And finally \u2013 so meanwhile we have guests. We have a friend coming over \u2013 a close friend. It wasn\u2019t like a real (unclear) was coming to help us, but I\u2019ve got this scum on my T-shirt and I\u2019m shuttling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">back and for the between the baby and my mother-in-law is going, \u2018why didn\u2019t you call the plumber?\u2019 Whatever \u2013 I don\u2019t want to pay for it. He finally fixed it. He and his wife somehow finally fixed it. God only knows, but the drain was gone and he said, \u2018you know, you\u2019ve got to use these special baskets <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">to catch all that \u2013 f\u2019.\u2019 It\u2019s not the baskets! It\u2019s your goddamn plumbing. But we have a very nice relationship, he and I. We\u2019re \u2013 we have a good rapport and it was fine. Nothing was bad. And it all worked out in the end. But meanwhile, this is a round-about way of saying, I just felt so upset. I spent <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">the next \u2013 and Jennie said \u2013 and this was like 6 o\u2019clock p.m. by the time this was all over. We had planned to spend the day relaxing with this luxurious au pair to help us. She\u2019s like, \u2018go to bed.\u2019 And I said, \u2018yes, okay, I\u2019ll go to bed.\u2019 It was 7 by this time. Her mother made us dinner. It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200215\">7:30. I couldn\u2019t make myself go to bed. I was so upset. And Jennie said, I see you\u2019re so upset.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561398\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">And I was thinking about it and you know, the obvious thing and I said to her at the time was like, \u2018I feel so invested in making this environment a protective and orderly for this little person, and orderly and sane, stable, safe environment and this Drain-O\/clog catastrophe just inserted itself into <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">the middle of it and set off an explosive device and it\u2019s hard for me to reconcile.\u2019 And by this time the kitchen still smelled like a little bit of Drain-O and it was more or less back to normal, but I was so upset. And then I was thinking about this and I realized with some shock and surprise and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">curiosity that in this framework of being a father, of having prepared the house, of having some sense of protectiveness toward the quality of the environment I\u2019m incredibly detail oriented. I mean like really, really specific in needs and very meticulous in my execution of them and this is completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200233\">contrary to the way that I think of myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">And the next thought was, just by the by, I for years, 20 years, 30 years, I\u2019ve really both behaved in a way that was anything but detail oriented, like kind of antithetical to detail orientation and had an image of myself as very slapdash and kind of \u2013 and I wondered what was going on there and I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">the thought that I had in my head was whatever it was, I was not drifting off to sleep but nattering around with the jars in the pantry, something to the effect of you know, that was somebody else\u2019s stuff. You know, I just got tired \u2013 I felt trapped into doing things that other people wanted me to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">and in that framework I was not particularly detail oriented but in this framework where this is something of me and something that\u2019s mine I don\u2019t have a problem being detail oriented. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">And I had a kind of laugh at that point because I had imagined for some time \u2013 this is a conversation you and I had about psychotropics, you know, that there would be some instrumental intervention that would assist my detail orientation like you know, Ritalin or SRI s and I\u2019d done an experiment with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200271\">SRIs. I\u2019ve been off it for two and a half, three weeks that I\u2019ve stopped taking it and my initial reaction to it \u2013 remember there was this strange, from an experimental point of view, coincidence of quitting this job and beginning to take these drugs. So I had basically assumed that this shift toward <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200272\">detail orientation had been the effect of the drugs but what becomes obvious is that \u2013 and this will please you as a psychoanalytic therapist \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561398\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">CLIENT: That it had nothing to do with it. There\u2019s something in this cluster of behaviors that has been so disruptive for me that fuck all to do with \u2013 I mean, I presume that its predisposition but anyway, I am very detail oriented. I turn out to be very meticulous. I turn out to be evidently capable <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B1\">of just in there and not only being OCD or whatever, but actually being directed in that level of focus and concentration and detail orientation. And all that\u2019s required is that I feel an investment and that was a very nice thought, I guess, as I was trying to get off to bed. That was a very nice thing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B2\">So that was a very long story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well I think it is, I mean \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">PAUSE: [00:15:38 [00:16:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">THERAPIST: I had the image as you were talking, for example, of your room two or three years ago when you couldn\u2019t clean it up, as being like a blockage. And your reacting internally in ways sometimes more exactly with your time not unlike you reacted to the blockage \u2013 like, fuck, you know and frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">and that\u2019s not the moment you\u2019re meticulous. You\u2019re pissed off and overwhelmed like \u2013 and then you know, like my next thought is there has been, have been blockages in more attempts to make a more secure, stable environment for yourself and those cause you to react in a way that kind of expectedly makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200312\">it hard to think, be careful, maybe for the constructive ways you could be \u2013 there\u2019s a block and you\u2019re pissed and helpless and it blows everything up. \u2018I\u2019m not sure why.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: (Laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure why I feel the need to defend my behavior in the face of this blockage which was \u2013 I did do the right thing. I snaked it out exactly in the right way. I had all the right tools there at my disposal. There was an unexpected whatever that brought the blockage in the rush of water <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">into the kitchen floor and unexpected like I confronted them and I had these rules and presence of mind to be confront them and to be \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: perfectly honest had the landlord not come upstairs it probably would have been solved in approximately two and a half fewer hours with fewer orthopedic problems down the road for him and his wife than otherwise. I don\u2019t know why I support this need to specify that but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Good point and I think you\u2019re totally right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: So following your metaphor the question would be, again, why those other blockages produced such a radically different response from me and I guess I come back to me this sense of me not being able to own the things that I was supposedly responsible for. Now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a great way <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">of being because at some level we, none of own the things we\u2019re responsible for. Very few of us unless you happen to be unusually independently wealthy or unusually whatever, fortunate. But I think there\u2019s something there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">I mean the other thing I was thinking about a lot was, and I\u2019m sure this was obvious from the story was how important the contrast between my household and the one I grew up in clearly was. And one of the reasons it was some of the chaos that I remember, or that I felt wounded by and somehow the penetration <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">of entropic force into this very carefully preserved little space, was upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561398\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think, my impression is that it sort of goes some ways towards answering your first question in that it was a bit like you reacted to the penetration of entropic force into this space but you also, I think, were sure and confident enough that it was manageable in this instance that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">it didn\u2019t blow you up in the way in other circumstances it has. You know, like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">CLIENT: This I could manage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like I think you had some \u2013 maybe part of what\u2019s so instructive about this example, or helpful, is you had some of the kind of angry or explosive reaction but also it was a manageable enough situation and I think you are confident enough in the few months of setting the space up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\">knowing this is going to be fixed one way or another and knowing you have help there that matters in Jennie and her mother, that you stayed with it and acted, as you say, quite constructively.

And it\u2019s not, I haven\u2019t reached the point where I\u2019m anal, like everything doesn\u2019t have to be in place, and there are (unclear) and photographs that as in any office really, or most offices that I\u2019m aware of where you have patience or what have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">you, it\u2019s whatever, it\u2019s used, but it\u2019s not dirty. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s food lying around. There\u2019s not like piles of mail that have been unopened for seven months. There\u2019s a paper shredder. It\u2019s a real office. It\u2019s a real functional office where you can fold out the bed and it\u2019s a bedroom. There are <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">books on the walls and I actually read them sometimes. What am I trying to say? Something\u2019s shifted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: And the fact that it didn\u2019t shift for so long means something about the blockage or something about how I was responding to the blockage which I think is the pertinent point.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561398\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not quite sure how this fits but it seems actually like the thing that shifted the blockage was seeing Isaac.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Something about \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes \u2013 very important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: And being able to redo it for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, becoming a father. And I mean I guess the way I have been thinking about this is that this put an end to my relationship, my former relationship with my father. Not like, all relationship for all time but it\u2019s like somehow for what, almost 18 years after he died I was unable to shift the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">terms. It was not until I did it myself that I could do that. And it\u2019s been dramatic, I mean like dramatic, dramatic and part of the drama is the fact that I have a sense again, rightly or wrongly, I\u2019m not sure how strongly I want to interpret some of this stuff \u2013 but I have the sense that everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200732\">that I\u2019ve been doing up to now professionally has in some way been just tangled or implicated in this relationship in the vein of doing what my father wanted and not mine \u2013 something I didn\u2019t have ownership of and because of that sense of coercion, all of this non-detail orientation, this lack of focus, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200733\">this sense of distress, to be more psychologically attuned, obtain. And I think in my more, I don\u2019t know, x-moments \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what to fill that place holder with, I think to myself, \u2018I cannot go back to that.\u2019 I cannot do what I was doing before. The only way to preserve this sense of clarity and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200734\">detail orientation is to kind of, I don\u2019t know, this sense of contentment and well-being, is to do something completely different. That seems potentially fucked up to me and there are practicalities involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s kind of the way I\u2019m feeling right now. That, at the very least, is my train of thought. Almost exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: That you can keep it if you keep away from that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And keeping away from that means doing something completely and utterly different that\u2019s mine and it\u2019s not implicated in his desire to resuscitate his academic career or his desire to be the Messiah or his desire to \u2013 once it was clear that that wasn\u2019t going to happen, to have his son <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">fill that role for him. I told you the story of how, probably, a day before he died he sent my sister out to look at the fruit trees and report back to him \u2013 like there\u2019s a scene in the Bible when Moses dies where he did something similar. And then he looked at me and very sententiously, he could barely <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B2\">talk at that point, he said, you will become a great social (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Oh, he did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. He did (laughing). That\u2019s remarkable that I didn\u2019t tell you that.

It\u2019s often metaphors that have to do with intrusiveness and chaos, like the star, like the pitchfork up the ass -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: Spear. Quotes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That makes more sense in a way. You know, the really sort of intrusive dying pronouncement. I even think the bit about the contrast was correct \u2013 like he actually helped you to make the space for the baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s pretty intrusive. I like him a lot. He\u2019s a pain in the ass. He\u2019s like the house is really his domain. He\u2019s been able to keep it together with chewing gum and baling wire for 40 years now. He is up on our balcony half the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I guess I have this sense that he helps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: He\u2019s intrusive. He helps \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I see. He is intrusive. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: We\u2019re paying so much less than market for a three bedroom apartment in the most convenient location in all the Providence metropolitan area, you know, above a really nice older couple one of whom is a very conscientious landlord and just kind of pulls up his sleeves on half an hour before he <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">has to be \u2013 like, and you know it\u2019s like whatever. He\u2019s human and this is a human relationship and it\u2019s not perfect and it is marked by intrusiveness on his part, so I\u2019m not sure how well that works. But he is helpful and he is definitely conscientious. He\u2019s a real mensch as my grandmother would say. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD2\">He\u2019s really, he\u2019s got good character and he cares about people who have good character and it\u2019s just a good relationship \u2013 good landlord\/tenant relationship that has some affection. So I don\u2019t know about the intrusiveness but that\u2019s kind of my take on how we interact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">My dad \u2013 fuck, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s also true \u2013 you know the other day I was thinking that \u2013 the other day \u2013 I can\u2019t remember exactly how, but I was looking at the family photographs and preparing for, I actually wanted to bring a whole box of them to Brown to scan them this morning and Jennie forbade <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">me to do it. She said, \u2018you\u2019ve had an hour and a half of sleep. Just go to fucking Marshall and come back.\u2019 So I\u2019m not doing that to my disappointment. I\u2019ve been looking through the family photographs and there are many, many of my father and me and it\u2019s not just a obtrusiveness, it\u2019s real affection <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF2\">and there was real affinity and all the stupid things I ended up getting mixed up in because of his desire to God knows what. All of those aside it was really interesting doing these things. I ran a kiwi farm. How many people can say that? You know, after college many interesting things. So maybe there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF3\">some of that, too. Maybe that\u2019s there\u2019s some of that, too. Maybe that\u2019s the analogy there as much as \u2013 it\u2019s not so much a contrast as an analogy in which between Nick and my father in which I don\u2019t think of him as my father, I just kind of redeem the aspects of my father. It\u2019s in reverse. It\u2019s not that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF4\">my father\u2019s characteristics are projected onto these other people \u2013 somehow Nick\u2019s characteristics are projected onto my father that the coincidence in their ages and so on is enough to do that which is a nice \u2013 I can kind of see my father as Nick in some very specific ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561398\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">(PAUSE): [00:38 2100:38:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: I mean he\u2019s part of the ceremony, this naming ceremony \u2013 he has to be.
