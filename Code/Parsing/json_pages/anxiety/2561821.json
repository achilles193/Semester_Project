How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m good. I feel like the last time we talked I was feeling so conflicted about my decision, so I decided to accept the invitation and I felt really good about it. Like I think it helped to talk it through with you and to talk it through with Todd. It was funny, I was like, \u2018we need to reserve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">a night where we can just really talk about it.\u2019 Because I felt like we were having kind of like here and there kind of conversations about it and I said to him about it, \u2018I know you\u2019re excited for me about getting the invitation, but I don\u2019t even know like how you feel about it.\u2019 I just felt like we <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">hadn\u2019t been able to really sit down and talk seriously about it. It was all kind of like, \u2018oh, cool. Like we can make that work.\u2019 Off the cuff kind of stuff so that helped to just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I know when we talked last time you were planning to have a sit down conversation with him, or you were planning to have a sit down conversation with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Right. So that felt good just to know like that he was on board and like we talked about it and I felt it is more of a family decision, that it influences Todd and Trae, so it felt good to know that he really thought it was a good thing for me to do if I wanted to do it. And it was just nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">to think, too. Like it was really funny that I didn\u2019t really even think about just using more time, like going beyond the sixth year if I needed it until we talked. And I think that\u2019s very me, like I just have in my head that like year six was going to be when I graduated. And I think like having that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">on the table and maybe I\u2019ll be able to get it all done and it will work out okay and I will be fine, but talking to Todd about that also just like as our backup plan kind of made me feel better that if things were feeling like it start to get like a little too hectic and you felt like there were too <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">many things happening with too many deadlines, that there was the opportunity to just push out a little bit, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: To even have that flexibility of moving things gives you some breathing room \u2013 just knowing that you could use it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: So I think it is nice to kind of have that in the back of my mind that like it just makes me feel a little bit better to know that there\u2019s a backup plan. If this is more work than I thought or consuming more than I anticipated, like something can be done. Like it\u2019s not like I\u2019m locked into something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">in this other deadline that I have in mind. So that feels better and I feel like there\u2019s still the whole financial thing. Like it\u2019s hard not having Todd have a full salary and contributing in that way and me feeling like I\u2019m just contributing here and there for now and knowing that I will eventually, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">hopefully, I will have a fulltime job or (unclear) fulltime job and be able to have a full salary but that part is hard because I know he feels a lot of responsibility and is definitely looking forward to when I\u2019ll be able to graduate and make some money too. So it\u2019s like, that\u2019s the only thing with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">like going extra time. I think that would kind of have a financial impact. Not like we wouldn\u2019t be able to pay our rent, but just that it will be \u2013 we\u2019re ready now to be having a little bit more money coming in especially if we want to have a second baby and just like kind of thinking down the road <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">kinds of things, like that still is kind of a draw back. But I think there\u2019s other \u2013 like I\u2019m working on a little side project with [MARAC] (ph) right now as a consultant, so I\u2019m hoping I can kind of keep that going this summer and make a little extra money and just kind of have that as a side thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">in terms of like the finances of it all. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: And if you did the seventh year, would that make it so you could do a consulting project again or something bigger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d be giving yourself more time to do your dissertation. Would it make more time for other like little projects?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: I think so. Yeah, I would hope so that it wouldn\u2019t just all be 100% school by then, you know, that I would be able to have a little bit more money coming in that way. So I think that part will work out and it\u2019s \u2013 but it is \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m such a \u2013 Todd always calls me the squirrel. Like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">the one in charge of like our bank accounts and stuff. Like I love to know that we\u2019re saving money and now this has been a year where we\u2019ve been dipping into savings a little bit but it\u2019s also what it\u2019s there for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what you\u2019d said before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: It\u2019s to help pay for our education and to pay for me, like I could not be home with Trae for one day and take on another job, you know like it all \u2013 you know, but that\u2019s like our decision. I\u2019d much rather be dipping into savings a little bit and have time with him right now. So it\u2019s all working <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">out well now but I think it just makes Todd a little anxious thinking like so now it\u2019s not, like it\u2019s a little bit \u2013 it could be more time that things are \u2013 we just need to be a little more careful. But I think it will be fine. And we don\u2019t really know, so it\u2019s also nice not to have to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Right. You might not even feel like you need that extra \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And so I feel like the only other little piece is just like talking with my advisor about the position for the fall and part of me, I just want to wait until my dissertation proposal is submitted and approved by him, until I even bring it up which I know \u2013 Todd was like, \u2018he would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">never let that influence whether or not he\u2019s going to approve your proposal.\u2019 But I feel like I just want to keep it separate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: There is also not necessarily a need to have that discussion right now. I mean you\u2019re talking about what your position looks like for the fall and it isn\u2019t even spring yet. So if you feel more comfortable separating the two things, you have the space to do that. That\u2019s not coming up right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So that has been nice and I feel like I\u2019ll just let myself hopefully be able to submit that. April 18th is the deadline and then just be able to talk to him and I feel like I can be honest with him and just kind of \u2013 I just want to like figure out if there\u2019s a way to be creative. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">I feel like I\u2019ve kind of assumed this role of taking a full slot, being there for our team meeting before class and taking the role of the head TF and is there like some flexibility in there? I think a big thing is that I really don\u2019t want to have to go to classes from 4 to 7 because that would be like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">two nights that I\u2019m away from Trae and usually he\u2019s not asleep by the time I would get home from 7 o\u2019clock class, but I really don\u2019t want that. To have two nights for a whole semester where I\u2019m away from him. So I think there have been other TFs in the past who haven\u2019t come to class but have supported <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">students and have come to the team meeting or whatever. So just talking about ways \u2013 (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: To these classes before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Exactly yeah. This will be my fifth year TF\u2019ing the class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: So you know the material pretty well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) So I think, I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be open to that and trying to like slide myself out of this role of head TF and kind of \u2013 I want to talk to my friend who was the head TF when I first started and see how she did that. And she\u2019s in Indiana now, but she\u2019ll be on campus, I think, next <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">week or the week after. So I\u2019ve already told her, it\u2019s like, we need to be sure to talk in person so I think I\u2019ll be able to get some pointers with her because I know she felt the same way that it\u2019s like, it\u2019s hard to kind of remove yourself a little from that TF role. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s our advisor. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">I think he\u2019s our co-advisor. At the very least he\u2019s on our committee. And just it makes \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it just complicates I think, that TF relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, having two different relationships with the same person. Those dual roles are tough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: So I think that is something. Like that\u2019s kind of the last piece to make me feel really confident about the decision. But I was also thinking, I\u2019m not going to let TF\u2019ing like hold me up in making this decision. Like that shouldn\u2019t influence me in whether or not \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t sacrifice because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">I have to TF Jeff\u2019s class. I didn\u2019t want that to like make or break my decision but it is something that is kind of lingering for me like wanting to make sure I get that settled. But I do feel like the first meeting will be May 8th. We meet Thursday nights and I\u2019m like looking forward to that. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">I was wondering what my instruction might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. But I\u2019m excited about it, just to see who else is on the board. Like it\u2019s kind of funny \u2013 we\u2019ve been joking that it\u2019s like this sorority or fraternity like it\u2019s kind of like a secret thing. I think they did a nice job, I have no idea \u2013 I know of one other person applying, but other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">than that I knew nothing about who applied, how many people applied, how many people they accepted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: But it was kind of just nice that I knew it was something I wanted to do. I had no idea what the competition was like or whatever. And so because of that secrecy it was nice during the application process, but now I\u2019m kind of like, I don\u2019t know who else is going to be there and so I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">that part will be fun to just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, that first meeting like see who it is that I\u2019m going to be meeting and developing these relationships with over \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Spending your Thursday evenings with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I don\u2019t know but I\u2019m definitely feeling good about it. But I also wonder as it gets closer, like I still just feel like that sadness about not being with Trae and Todd, too. Although I do feel like we should start having family dinners kind of soon but we still eat after Todd goes to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">bed because it\u2019s like a nice time for us and so I don\u2019t know if that piece will feel sadder as I\u2019m getting closer. And right now we\u2019re going to be switching Trae \u2013 I\u2019m TF\u2019ing a class that meets on Fridays so he goes to day care Fridays and my day home with him is Thursdays but as soon as the semester <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">ends we\u2019re going to switch it back because usually if we go off to New Hampshire on Friday and we don\u2019t want to need day care. But I\u2019ve already been thinking about that so for that small time when he\u2019s in day care on Thursdays, he\u2019ll go to day care and then I\u2019ll not see him from the morning until the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">next morning \u2013 so far we\u2019ve been joking with Todd, \u2018do you think you can bring him over and we\u2019ll go to the playground like when you pick him up from day care and then I\u2019ll just meet you for twenty minutes and then run to the meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Just like figuring little work-arounds so I don\u2019t feel bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: I also think, \u2018let yourself experience it and see.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019re trying to anticipate how you will feel and kind of inserting feelings that you will have and we don\u2019t know \u2013 you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be sitting, disengaged, noticing what you\u2019re missing out on. You\u2019re going to be engaged in something else. I think allowing yourself to have the experience of what it\u2019s like to not be home those nights, to be somewhere else. Maybe you\u2019ll miss him. Maybe you won\u2019t. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">That\u2019s okay, too. Maybe you\u2019ll enjoy the adult conversation. Maybe you\u2019ll be sad. But allow yourself to experience whatever it is that you\u2019re going to experience and see what it\u2019s like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Rather than trying to anticipate and predict what it\u2019s going to be like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It might not be the same each week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: No, I know.

But I do just feel it\u2019s kind of like we were home \u2013 Todd was away at a conference this weekend so I took Trae home just for Saturday night to my parents and that was something \u2013 my mom never would have done \u2013 like she never would have had a consistent night away from us growing up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">so I wonder if that\u2019s like part of it that feels a little different. And we talked a little bit about that and she said, \u2018there were only a few times that I would leave you,\u2019 like with grandparents or whatever. So it wasn\u2019t something \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: What does that mean to you?

Like part of me is like \u2013 well, is that bad? Like if she made sure that she was always home for us and I am doing this thing that\u2019s going to take me away from being home once a week \u2013 but then another part of me is thinking that\u2019s probably a good thing, too. I think we did <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">have a lot of \u2013 like it was hard for me to leave my mom especially, but to leave home like to go to college, or like when I was younger even like over nights, especially to go stay with my dad for weekends and things like that. It was always really, really hard for me to leave and so part of me wonders <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B2\">\u2013 so part of me wonders like \u2013 it\u2019s probably a good, like healthy thing for me too to be doing that. And Todd definitely thinks that, too. Because he kind of jokes saying that my mom is definitely like a hoverer, you know, and always there and part of it, like me being the daughter, like that was great. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B3\">And he, of course, thinks that she\u2019s a wonderful mother, but there are parts of our relationship that he sees like maybe that wouldn\u2019t be as good, like to have that like, I don\u2019t know, never leaving. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: There are so many, obviously the way that you\u2019re parented impacts how you perceive and respond to the world, but there is no one right way to parent or to perceive the world, so having that consistency probably gave you lots of good things when you have a really strong and supportive relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">with your mom. Maybe it is something that made it hard to deal with flexibility or spontaneity or lots of difference. Like it didn\u2019t give you a chance to experience being comfortable in lots of places. Maybe it had nothing to do with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: But I think just because that\u2019s one way she did it and there were some great things about it doesn\u2019t mean that doing it a different way \u2013 there\u2019s not great things about that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: There will be things that Trae will get out of having time alone with Dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Right. And I\u2019ve been noticing that. This has been a tough semester that Todd has been teaching Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday so I feel like Trae and I have had a lot of together time during the evening and I\u2019ve kind of picked up when Todd comes home, Trae will want to be still sitting on my <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">lap to read a story or he\u2019ll still want me to brush his teeth and things like that and so I was saying to Todd that I think that will help, and not like then there\u2019s other times when he only wants Todd. But I\u2019ve noticed it a little bit more when Todd comes home and I know Todd\u2019s noticed it too and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">think it kind of like hurts his feelings a little bit to like finally get home but then there are some nights \u2013 not every night, but some nights when Trae\u2019s more clinging to me. So I think that will be a good thing too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: So giving him a chance when you\u2019re not an option might be really good for Trae to be able to develop more of an equal comfort in you guys doing your routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Because Dad will have to do the routine and when you\u2019re there as an option it\u2019s much easier if he\u2019s asking for you to let it be you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: If you\u2019re not there, Dad\u2019s going to have to be the one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know. So I think that will be good. But that\u2019s another piece like then I wonder how I will think of it. Like part of me kind of likes that he wants me you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s nice to be needed and wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I don\u2019t think that will go away just with one night away, too, but it will lead to something that\u2019s different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: Allowing yourself to figure out your own way. Your mom did a really good job. So sort of letting you figure out how you\u2019re going to be a mom. Right, and how that changes as Trae gets older and your life changes too that you might not do things the way you did them the first year.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So overall though I feel like it\u2019s something different, too, which I feel like, I know we\u2019ve talked about this but that this year is kind of isolating just being away from the rest of my cohort and like kind of, I love working on my own research project because it\u2019s my own interest <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">but you don\u2019t have like all these other people working on the same thing, you\u2019re kind of doing it by yourself, so I think it will be nice. It will like break up the pattern that I\u2019ve kind of felt now of it being more isolated. So I think it will be nice working with a group again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well, good for you. I\u2019m glad you came to your decision. It feels like a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yes. Right now it does. I hope it still feels that way but that was one other things. One of my friends mentioned that she was kind of on the bench and it took her a long time to decide and she said that even with the first few meetings she still was not quite sure and now it\u2019s the end of her <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">first year and she\u2019s just like raving about it. So I kind of want to keep in my head, too, it might not be the first meeting where I\u2019m like oh my gosh, this is like the best decision I ever made. So it might take a little while to kind of ease into it, too, I guess. I don\u2019t know, it was just kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F2\">nice to hear her say that too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you\u2019ve got lots of stories about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes, I know. I feel like I have done my homework on that part at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: And Todd\u2019s advisor from his doctoral program went to the school here so I\u2019m going to talk with her too and go over to Cambridge and bring Trae because she hasn\u2019t seen him in a while so it\u2019ll be nice to get like a former board member\u2019s perspective, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: People who have all lived through it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yes. And she has two girls and I think she had one of her girls during that time, so that will be good, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It sounds hopeful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yes. And now I just also feel like it\u2019s just kind of I\u2019m in that like crunch time of trying to get my dissertation proposal approved and then submitted by this April 18th deadline. And so I sent it off to my advisor first and I heard back from him and he was like, \u2018this looks great, I have no <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">changes. Just send it to the rest of your committee.\u2019 Which was like a huge relief and so nice to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s really good feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But then I think part of me was just, \u2018oh, I hope it will be this easy with other committee members.\u2019 And I do have feedback from them \u2013 nothing like huge, but now it\u2019s like this kind of like, this urge to make sure I get all that feedback incorporated as soon as I can because I need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">send it back out to them to make sure it\u2019s approved and if I have any other changes due before next Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Eleven days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that just feels like a little \u2013 I just got one of my committee members\u2019 feedback on Friday and I didn\u2019t find it until Saturday morning and then another of Ryan\u2019s just this morning. So I do feel like it\u2019s kind of now, I feel this kind of like this craziness trying to make sure it all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">gets in place by this established deadline and just it\u2019s so hard going back and forth between four different people and getting four different people\u2019s approval. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: The feedback that you got \u2013 how do you feel about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: I feel good about most of it. There are a couple of things from my committee members that \u2013 he said, here are some small changes that I think you should do. His introduction in the e-mail was very positive and here are the small changes. And two of the changes he was suggesting felt like kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB1\">of big to me so I\u2019m \u2013 that\u2019s another thing like it would be one thing if they give you feedback and I could just go in and incorporate it but that, especially, I feel like I\u2019m a little confused by what he means and so I just e-mailed him to try and set up a meeting but all of that then feels like it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB2\">takes so much longer to now I feel like wait to talk to him in person because if he\u2019s saying that it\u2019s small I guess I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I would incorporate that in a small way. It felt like a little broader to me so I think part of me was just hoping for these like easy changes that I could incorporate <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB3\">on my own, so easily and then send it out but I think I have to recognize that the process so far has been pretty smooth so I need to know that there\u2019s got to be something that\u2019s got to make it a little more challenging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well being able to have a conversation with him about understanding really what that feedback was. And then the other perspective is, if it is a bigger change, how much of it needs to be completed for proposal time? And then is it an option of being able to acknowledge that yes this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">is something that maybe you\u2019d be able to work to incorporate but might not be done for the proposal but that you would need to incorporate after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: So just some questions to kind of hold in your head. Talk to him to find if it is something that you can get done by the 18th. Maybe that doesn\u2019t have to mean the deadline gets missed but you kind of agree that it gets rolled into later dissertation stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I\u2019m hoping one of the things he said, that\u2019s what he had in mind and just didn\u2019t communicate that in the e-mail. But it just is kind of like this unsettled feeling that I have right now of trying to get stuff done and trying to get it out to them so that I can hear back and it all <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">just feels a little rushed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Or squeezed in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m still trying to hear from or even connect with the school that I want to be doing all this at and that\u2019s another thing. They don\u2019t have to have my research site confirmed in my proposal but my advisor is thinking that will make my proposal that much stronger to have it. But you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">\u2013 it\u2019s so hard to get in touch with the principal in the middle of the school day and so I\u2019ve been like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Especially right before your publication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: I know. And the last couple of weeks have been crazy so I know she\u2019s so busy. So I feel like there are just lots of things up in the air right now, that getting to the day of actually submitting it is so far away. But the actual number of days is really close.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s hard when they\u2019re not \u2013 some of them are out of your control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know. I think that is a really hard part because a lot of it is just like waiting \u2013 waiting to hear from feedback and waiting for a principal to call me back and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So those are good \u2013 with all that waiting is sort of a good opportunity to think about how do you manage your anxiety when it\u2019s something that is out of your control. You can\u2019t \u2013 this isn\u2019t, \u2018oh, did I forget to cite that?\u2019 And you can go check. It\u2019s just out of your control. You\u2019re waiting <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C11\">to hear from other people. How do you manage that sitting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: I know and I feel like there have been like little things that I still have been working on as it was out so I haven\u2019t had that time yet, but I know I will, especially once I hand off this next version so I know and I\u2019m not sure how to handle that. I feel like that is a hard part. Especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">because I\u2019ll be like knowing that I probably won\u2019t send out another draft until the end of this week, hopefully. So then like knowing the deadline\u2019s only a week away I think that waiting will be even harder just knowing the days are like ticking by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So that might be a good time to think about scheduling time for yourself to do a yoga class or practicing your deep breathing and visualization in those times when you don\u2019t have \u2013 it sounds like what you do right now is you find another place to channel that nervous energy like having something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C51\">else you can work on while awaiting feedback on something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But if there is not \u2013 which is an okay strategy. Channeling that energy somewhere is perfectly fine coping. If you don\u2019t have that, maybe finding a soothing strategy to help you sit with uncertainty and sit with the intention of having to wait and trying to reduce the physical tension you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C91\">feel and keep those anxiety symptoms at bay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that will be good. Because even last night like going to bed. Ryan said he\u2019d give me feedback by Sunday. I checked my e-mail earlier in the evening and I didn\u2019t see anything so I kind of knew it would be there in the morning and I was letting myself like, letting my mind kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">wander to things that I could worry about. I caught myself like when I was at my parents they have this little carbon monoxide monitor that I unplug to put my hair dryer in and then I was thinking I was like, when I plugged it back in I hope I turned it on. Like what if I haven\u2019t turned it back on? <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB2\">Are they going to be poisoned by carbon monoxide? I was kind of like letting myself \u2013 that is something every time I go home I take that same plug out and dry my hair in the same space and that\u2019s never occurred to me until last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: That was something to put anxiety on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. My kind of signal that I was like \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to worry about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">THERAPIST: How did you let go of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">CLIENT: That was like, \u2018this is silly.\u2019 Because at first it was like you know, 11 o\u2019clock when I thought of it. And I was like, I wonder if my mom is still awake. And I thought, you cannot call home and wake up your poor parents asking them if you plugged in like this thing correctly. That was good <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D31\">like I did fall asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You were able to let go of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: And it was good. Part of me really did think like I could even just like text her and say like, \u2018are you awake?\u2019 But I knew immediately she would worry about something real. That\u2019s not fair to do. That\u2019s not something that I need to worry them about something that\u2019s fine. But even still like <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D71\">a part of me is still when I do just talk to her I want to say, \u2018is that plugged in, right?\u2019 So I don\u2019t really know why I do that. That\u2019s something I feel like I\u2019ve gotten better about it, like little things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019ve noticed it as you do it so you have a chance to say to yourself this is displaced anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m going to let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I knew I wasn\u2019t really worried about that.

It\u2019s an appropriate thing to feel worried about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t have to interfere with how you sleep or if you enjoy your time with your husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like separating it if you have this feeling it doesn\u2019t have to interfere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I remembered you saying in the past that you just have to know you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable and just kind of sit with it and I feel like that\u2019s kind of going to be the next couple of weeks and if I can just contain it to school then \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: So you leave the discomfort where it makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: The fancy word for it is distress tolerance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Ooh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: Because we can\u2019t make all pain go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: Sometimes there are things that are uncomfortable. When you push your anxiety onto something else rather than leaving it where it makes sense that\u2019s where sometimes it can become problematic because then you start maybe obsessing about something and it becomes repetitive and it eats up all <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">this time and it makes you feel a little bit crazy because part of you is recognizing that this seems like out of proportion and the other part of you is feeling really uncomfortable. If you can put it where it belongs you don\u2019t have that sort of added discomfort of feeling like you\u2019re crazy and out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: When you feel like, \u2018oh, I\u2019m nervous about my dissertation feedback, or my proposal feedback.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: And that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: As are like all of your classmates when they go through this, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: Then you\u2019re not crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like it is kind of knowing that the next couple of weeks might be hard and that\u2019s okay and yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: And then I think looking for outlets, right? So if you know it\u2019s going to be a hard week and that you might have sort of some nervous energy then you can plan for maybe being a little more careful about your bedtime routine because some of this might leak out at night. So this might not be <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201151\">a time to be lax with the schedule. Scheduling some extra time for just taking a walk or if you can fit in an extra yoga class or sometime playing outside on a playground is a really good way to discharge some of that energy and you\u2019re being proactive about that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because I do notice myself at night. Like I\u2019ll tell, because I\u2019ll always go in to check Trae right before I go to bed. And I\u2019ll like, I can tell by how long I stay in there to kind of like just check on him, like sometimes I\u2019ll check longer, make sure there\u2019s no blankets or anything around <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201171\">his crib, just like little things that I will check like multiple times in his room and sometimes that is like a sign to me that I\u2019m feeling more anxious and usually it\u2019s fine but it is like that at bedtime but I feel like there are certain things I need to check before I go to bed. Right now it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201172\">okay but I do wonder if that is a way that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: That might be a way to, a type of barometer to show how anxious you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">CLIENT: I know. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">THERAPIST: So just notice it if it comes up, if you notice that you\u2019re double checking, or checking extra things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: And try to stick to your normal schedule and your normal routine. You know, if you normally check for blankets once, check the blankets once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: Because keeping yourself structured is a way of keeping tabs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: You devote your energy towards things that are actually going to help your anxiety rather than devoting your time and your energy towards things that \u2013 double checking doesn\u2019t actually make you less anxious. Most times it actually reinforces the anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">THERAPIST: What happens is you feel immediately better after you double-check but then you\u2019re sort of teaching yourself that you\u2019re not trusting yourself the first time and if you stick to your normal routine and I think what you\u2019ll notice is that then the responses don\u2019t escalate the anxiety the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D1\">they may have in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I do feel myself like that I have like a certain routine that I do of checking before going to bed and is that something that is bad? Is it something that I should try not to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s similar to a bedtime routine that we highly suggest is that you have a routine. So I think what you want to notice is how much time does it take up? Is the time that your routine takes interfering with something else? So that\u2019s how we determine if something\u2019s a problem. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201311\">If it\u2019s not interfering then it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s adaptive to have some consistency. It\u2019s something that helps you know, \u2018okay, this is something that I do before I go to bed.\u2019 After I do this my body relaxes and shut\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s like a dog circling its pen. That\u2019s part of nature. But if the checking is taking up a half an hour and that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201351\">delaying bedtime and you\u2019re not getting enough sleep then that\u2019s problematic. If the routine takes a half an hour but you go to bed at a time that allows you to get a full night\u2019s sleep and you\u2019re not cutting into time to get other work done then that\u2019s fine. So what you want to look at is, is this <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201352\">interfering with something else that would be better for me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: And if not that\u2019s great. If the pattern extends, that can be another sort of signal that it\u2019s not really working for you anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: So notice if it gets more elaborate.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2013C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561821\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And sometimes I feel like I go and checkup and I\u2019m not really thinking I\u2019ll go to make sure it\u2019s locked but I don\u2019t \u2013 like I just move it to make sure it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201431\">locked and I\u2019m not really thinking about it so then I\u2019ll be like, \u2018oh, I wasn\u2019t really paying attention when I did that so I want to make sure I really did it. And it takes one second so it\u2019s not really anything and I do think it is safe to make sure we have our doors locked before we go to bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20145\">THERAPIST: It seems reasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20147\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20149\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re testing for reasonability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Reasonableness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">CLIENT: But I feel like that is just something that sometimes I will do multiple times and one of them is I always check that the heat is down before I go to bed because then we get really hot in the middle of the night and sometimes I\u2019ll crank it up before I get home because it\u2019s so cold out. So things <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F1\">like that are reasonable to check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">CLIENT: Before I go to bed but that I make sure to do it. You know, like I\u2019ll get up out of bed if I\u2019ve gone to bed to make sure that I\u2019ve \u2013 to go check the doors if I did forget to do it. So things like that like don\u2019t feel \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">THERAPIST: Those seem reasonable and not that elaborate and don\u2019t seem to take up much time. If it\u2019s really a continuum or there\u2019s some people sort of on a scale that would be like, \u2018check the doors? Nah. It\u2019s a safe neighborhood, whatever.\u2019 There\u2019s some people on one end of the scale and there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201551\">other people on the other end of the scale that\u2019s still within normal range that might get out of bed some nights to double check because they can\u2019t remember if they checked. And then there are people who are going to check fifteen times and not be able to relax. And then that feels like that\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201552\">interfering with settling down and going to sleep. So it\u2019s like there\u2019s a broad continuum of what\u2019s normal and then there\u2019s a range where it\u2019s maladaptive and it\u2019s getting in the way of being able to sort of perform your daily tasks. It doesn\u2019t sound like what you\u2019re describing is really getting in the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">CLIENT: No, it doesn\u2019t. But it does feel like there is an order like I\u2019ll brush my teeth, I\u2019ll check the locks at a certain time in the order of going to bed and I just didn\u2019t know what that was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">THERAPIST: Well, I think having an order helps you to remember, right? So it does become an automatic routine where you don\u2019t have to think about it and that\u2019s helpful. If you did it differently every night you\u2019d be more likely to forget pieces of it. Are you a more obsessive person than that person <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201591\">who sometimes checks the locks and sometimes doesn\u2019t and sometimes washes their face and sometimes doesn\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not necessarily problematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20161\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to make it a problem.

If you are having thoughts like, \u2018if I don\u2019t go check those doors something <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201791\">bad will happen.\u2019 Then that\u2019s anxiety producing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">THERAPIST: So that would be my marker of like let\u2019s try to create some more rational thoughts around this and let\u2019s try to create a pattern that is actually working for you to make you feel better rather than making you feel anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">THERAPIST: And it doesn\u2019t sound like you have \u2013 you kind of have a general worry like it\u2019s a good idea to lock the doors and make sure they\u2019re really locked but you\u2019re not reporting sort of an anxious thought of if I don\u2019t do this then bad consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">CLIENT: Right.

But I think it\u2019s good timing though because my parents are going away and so I said, you know, I\u2019m just going to be home with Trae on the day my mom usually comes instead of figuring out another plan. It will just be nice to have another day with him. So I <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2019F1\">just feel like I have some fun things to look forward to once the thing is out of my hands, too. So that\u2019s good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So you can really let go and enjoy the space that it is going to bring to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Well, let\u2019s take a few minutes to do some deep breathing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A7\">CLIENT: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201A9\">THERAPIST: And you are scheduled for after Easter and all that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">THERAPIST: The 28th at 12:30 is what I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AF\">CLIENT: I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019ve got that. Right. Yep. And then I just have cash today. I don\u2019t think I have a five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B1\">THERAPIST: I have three of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B3\">CLIENT: Whoa.

The cashier apologized as she gave me -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B7\">CLIENT: Perfect. Perfect for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201B9\">THERAPIST: I couldn\u2019t have planned it better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BB\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Actually, that\u2019s not right. You\u2019re copay is $25, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201BF\">CLIENT: If you don\u2019t have that now, I\u2019ll take all of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s right. Good. Sorry. The regular Brown (unclear) is $35 and I am so used to the discount. I count on people to be honest with me and tell me when I\u2019m not giving them enough change. So let yourself close your eyes and settle into a pace of breathing that feels comfortable for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C3\">(Pause): [00:41:15 \u2013 00:41:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C5\">THERAPIST: As you find that pace, allow yourself to scan your body and notice any places that feel tighter or uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C7\">(Pause): [00:41:36 \u2013 00:41:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Allowing yourself to let go of any of that tension that you notice as you let go. Let the tension float away with your breath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201CB\">(Pause): [00:41:50 \u2013 00:42:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201CD\">THERAPIST: And as your body becomes more relaxed you may notice that your breath begins to extend letting your inhales and your exhales match so take full deep breaths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201CF\">(Pause): [00:42:16 \u2013 00:42:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D1\">THERAPIST: You can also take a moment to check in on your thoughts, to just become aware of any thoughts that are in your head. Acknowledge those thoughts and then allow them to float away from you as you exhale. And then allowing your mind be clear and empty for now. Important thoughts can always come <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201D11\">back to you when you need them. For now you have nowhere else you need to be and nothing else you need to be thinking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D3\">(Pause): [00:43:06 \u2013 00:43:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D5\">THERAPIST: If you would like you can call up a word or an image that feels relaxing to you to allow yourself to focus on that. If nothing comes to you that is okay. Allow yourself to focus solely on the breath in that case. Either way allowing yourself to be fully relaxed and in the present moment, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201D51\">focusing on your inhales and exhales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D7\">(Pause): [00:44:05 \u2013 00:44:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201D9\">THERAPIST: And whenever you feel you are ready to allow yourself to come back to the room, come back carrying relaxation with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DB\">(Pause): [00:44:23 \u2013 00:44:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Alright, I will see you in a few weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DF\">CLIENT: Good.
