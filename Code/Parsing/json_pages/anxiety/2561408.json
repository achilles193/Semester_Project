I think there\u2019s some obsolescence built into human reproduction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) And your kid\u2019s only a few months old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yes, my biological evolutionary purpose has been satisfied. My mother has been here and she \u2013 I can\u2019t remember if this started before or after I spoke with you last Monday. She has volunteered to stay with the kid through the night so, A) we\u2019ve had some respite and, B) I think we have a plan <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">for a better trading off if one of us sleeps in the spare room. So among other thing, Jennie and I had our first date since the kid was born. That was nice. (inaudible). It was actually (inaudible). One of the things that she said was that she\u2019s really been struggling a little bit since shortly after <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">the birth which is kind of natural in parenthood and I think my enthusiasm has been a little bit difficult for her in some sense comparatively. So that was interesting, especially a conversation a couple of weeks ago. I guess it made me think of it. I thought that I had lost the video from the naming <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">ceremony but I figured out where to bring it up on the SD card. So I was looking at it again and it was very apparent. It kind of culminated with \u2013 so everybody, all the relatives we had invited, 10 people gave their own blessing and Jennie and I gave ours to Grayson, gave our blessing. And I was surprised <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">to see myself. I had been disappointed at the prospect of not being able to get an externalized sense of what I looked like in that role of a parent and was very assured. It was really striking to me. I don\u2019t know if I feel that assured but I looked (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And Jennie and I have kind of come to \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether we can make it work financially, we need to sit down and look at it \u2013 you know we touched on the discomfort I\u2019ve been sharing over the last couple of weeks with this odd tension and dialectic between this sense of sureness in what to all appearances <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">would seem to be the most terrifying and uncertain business of suddenly being transformed from one social (unclear) role to another and the much more prosaic question of what I\u2019m going to do professionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: And so my cousin Beth-Ann had brought this up \u2013 I think I mentioned it Monday, and I was chewing on that, made a little uncomfortable by how securely I had managed to evade such questions except when they pop up \u2013 peeking through the clouds I think was the metaphor. And I had a novel on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">shelf for about 15 years and so tentatively we decided that if I can really push to get a good draft of it in the next three months, then we can do three months and that \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s realistic financially. I\u2019m not pushing Jennie about this and I haven\u2019t wanted to because of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">dynamics of the situation to involve myself in it at all, but I know her father has offered to help us out so I\u2019m guessing \u2013 it\u2019s delicate. I think I\u2019m handling it the right way. At any rate I\u2019m assuming from her relative equanimity that she feels okay about her dad supporting a 3-month hiatus. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">that means I can also find something simultaneously, something. It doesn\u2019t have to be the be all and end all. But that felt good. That felt like a nice \u2013 it felt like something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time and this potentially \u2013 whether Grayson\u2019s relative equanimity compared to other newborns continues <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">as it has \u2013 become colicky or what have you, given my usual speed when I\u2019m not all fucked up, seems plausible. So that would be fun. At any rate, it\u2019s a nice fantasy. We\u2019ll see if it\u2019s plausible.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561408\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">So I think since I spoke with you last, that\u2019s moving forward a bit \u2013 at least conceptually. You know, regardless of what the outcome is, it\u2019s moving forward \u2013 at least we\u2019re talking about it explicitly, it\u2019s not completely on the shelf and I\u2019m not totally avoiding it. You know, the resolution is still <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">the same one of not \u2013 it\u2019s a postponement. In other words the resolution is a postponement of whatever, or a deferment of whatever has been so difficult about working on finding a place to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">(PAUSE): [00:09:21 00:9:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a very noncommittal response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I guess, I don\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s a work project. What I was hesitant about was like I understand that it\u2019s a postponement of looking for \u2013 let me back up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: So I think what I was pausing to think about and what you imagine I was pausing about or the noncommittal quality of my response may be importantly different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Likely, unless we have a mind (unclear) symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) I guess I had the impression that you had maybe a slight worry relating to the noncommittal quality of my response like maybe I made you a little more anxious about your plan or I was skeptical or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Maybe. I wasn\u2019t conscious of that. I was honestly a little amused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Of really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Because I see as kind of if you imagine someone sitting on the couch with the therapist with their back to him (laughing) going on and on and on and the therapist says, \u2018hmm, I see.\u2019 Puffing on their pipe. It\u2019s possible, even likely, that you\u2019re right. I\u2019m not totally in touch with my response. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">But that\u2019s kind of what was in my brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, I mean, I guess I imagined that if that\u2019s the case, the important difference that I have in mind is that actually I was thinking more like, \u2018hmm, this is the first work-related thing I\u2019ve heard Galen be enthusiastic about in quite this way.\u2019 And then you\u2019re saying that isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">exactly what you\u2019re saying but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Half apologetically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe like it doesn\u2019t like count or something and so that\u2019s the difference if it\u2019s there (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Huh. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s true. And I think one of the follow on thoughts that comes with that acknowledgement is that the concreteness and quasi-decision aside, I have had what are unquestionably, fantasies about just doing that full time \u2013 like actually making that work. That definitely <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">\u2013 whatever the complexity of my sort of orientation to it is, but actually it\u2019s only a fantasy and that \u2013 and I have had it. It has been occurring so you know, I am explicitly at some level, not quite willing to commit to it \u2013 sort of imagining what it would be like to have that sort of thing as a vocation <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">is more or less conscious at this point. I feel burned. I feel regret and discomfort and what have you with the last phase or two so I guess it\u2019s kind of natural to just sort of imagine something that doesn\u2019t depend on other people and doesn\u2019t have all of the complexities that seem to embedded in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">participation in other kinds of gigs. It\u2019s a very attractive proposition at this point. So you know, it\u2019s an escape fantasy to that degree but it\u2019s also \u2013 as you say, it\u2019s also a consideration of what to do completely apart from parenthood, so to that degree, it seems like the process is evolving in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200394\">a way that I would be much more comfortable with than I felt when we spoke on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561408\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">On Monday I think I felt as if I was avoiding something and it seems that, at least on this evidence, I\u2019m working on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It also seems to me that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">(PAUSE): [00:15:09 00:16:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I have the impression like you\u2019re also a bit hesitant to quite say this is something you might just enjoy. I guess you kind of imply it saying you\u2019re having fantasies about it but, again, you\u2019re saying, \u2018yeah, yeah, I can see how avoidance is something I have trouble with.\u2019 And I know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">you\u2019re meaning \u2013 you may be right and it makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m not stopping that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: But it also seems like as of a few minutes ago there\u2019s likely a kind of enthusiasm you feel for it that you seem wary or of mentioning \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel really wary. I feel very hurt by my previous attempt to throw myself into something with abandon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: And I feel working or being a freelancer, what have you, is a craft and it\u2019s not one that I\u2019ve applied myself to in particular. You know, I have some skills but they need to be developed, so it\u2019s a little bit \u2013 and I have friends, you know, who \u2013 it\u2019s their vocation and all of them have another <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">gig. I can\u2019t think of anybody who actually supports \u2013 no, I know one person, he\u2019s very well-known and it\u2019s his thing. But it\u2019s one in a thousand so you know, I\u2019m aware that living on one income with a kid is very difficult and I certainly is not \u2013 and on the one hand I do feel enthusiastic. It\u2019s a totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">cool idea. I feel excited about the idea or the novel. I feel like it\u2019s a good idea. I feel excited about trying to figure out whether I am any good \u2013 and beyond that, whether I can sell it to somebody \u2013 which are actually two different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: You know, I think I have a pretty non-fantastical sense of what the process is like. So I guess those two \u2013 and I\u2019m trying to balance those two and part of being a good novelist just being excited and part of being a good partner, parent, whatever is not going off the deep end and I\u2019m trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">to balance those too, right now. But yeah, cool and wild. I\u2019m psyched about that. And I\u2019m grateful that I have a partner who\u2019s cool with that and that she\u2019s kind of seen how much stress and trouble was being placed that I was ill-suited for for whatever reason, that was either my fault or just it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">a difficult system or some combination of the two and I think she wants me to be that (unclear) so that\u2019s pretty cool too. That\u2019s an exciting discovery in and of itself that I \u2013 yeah, so I guess by discussing it with Jennie I kind of brought it into the universe, this idea that I had and by discussing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F3\">with you I kind of ratified it in my own cosmos so I think it\u2019s going to happen in some type or form. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561408\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">So the hard part of actually producing art and figuring out how to make it work financially and so on (inaudible). One of the \u2013 totally random thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: You had said something last Monday, on Monday that brought back a thought I\u2019d had before that I probably voiced \u2013 now it\u2019s gone again. It was something along the lines of \u2013 you know my certainty or security of parenthood being curious or interesting or relevant to my discomfort with the parenting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">that I got or I guess we talked explicitly maybe Monday about this \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it was Monday or Friday, about not having any role models and yet feeling \u2013 it was so funny to watch that video. I really \u2013 I looked like very \u2013 it was nice to see myself just being \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m struggling for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">the words to describe it maybe because I don\u2019t have them. So at a certain point in my \u2013 I\u2019ve said this a couple of times, a certain point in my (unclear), or whatever you want to call it \u2013 anti-(unclear) in San Diego, as I imagined it kind of came back to reconciling with my father, I had this very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200553\">tangible fantasy while reading the meditations of Marcus Aurelius that that would be a good dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Dad being Marcus Aurelius.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Marcus Aurelius would be a good dad. That\u2019s funny if you\u2019ve ever seen Gladiator because (laughs) it didn\u2019t turn out so well in that interpretation anyway. But you know, like I read these and there was one in particular that kept on recurring. I can\u2019t remember how it\u2019s numbered \u2013 but he considers <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">all of the parts of the body in the Hellenistic, stoic model \u2013 all of the parts of the person, really, you know \u2013 the flesh, the breath and the ruling part \u2013 you know \u2013 the mind. And so he goes through them and the first two are ephemeral and then he adds this non sequitur \u2013 he says, \u2018don\u2019t read. Don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">read books.\u2019 Don\u2019t get distracted by them. He says, third is the ruling part. Consider thus, you\u2019re an old man, no longer let this part be a slave, no longer let yourself be pulled by the strings like a puppet by uncertain impulse, no longer be dissatisfied with your present lot or shrink from the future. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200593\">It\u2019s a wonderful meditation of an old man. And it\u2019s not so much \u2013 I didn\u2019t take this as somehow as just sort of the solitary reflections that they clearly were but just as the guiding spirit of a person because I imagined him being just about the age my father was at that particular junction. Just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200594\">the calmness and control something that I would have wanted at that particular moment with my father and me. So and I remember saying to somebody or other, \u2018wow, this is really bizarre, isn\u2019t it \u2013 I\u2019m looking for love in all the wrong places.\u2019 It\u2019s not \u2013 it wasn\u2019t about parenting. It was about who \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200595\">the person I wanted the parent to be and what was striking to me was not any parenting in that video of myself, it was the person I seemed to be in this sort of ritual of parenthood as I held my son, you know, in the ceremony. It was kind of remarkable. I hadn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know where it came from. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200596\">was very, it was mysterious. There was mystery there. It felt wonderful watching it. There was mystery there. I knew the person and yet I didn\u2019t know the person (unclear) in a very direct conceptual framework. So it was just \u2013 and I remember thinking that as you were talking and we never got around <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200597\">to it in the end, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561408\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: You know, there is something about this that \u2013 there\u2019s something about long processes of coming to terms with my dissatisfaction with what I received which seems to have had productive issues, so to speak, seems to have given birth to something but it\u2019s funny. And I guess at some level I\u2019m superstitious <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">so I worry that having just given voice to this I will fall apart or poison my (unclear) or something. I forgot my cellphone for the first time since Jennie was \u2013 in the last days of being pregnant. I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019ve been thinking about my dad quite a bit this week. We have all these pictures <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">my mother brought. We had a very interesting interaction with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">As I say, she offered to stay overnight with Grayson and she did for a couple of nights and I talked with Jennie about it and she was like, \u2018you know, I worry about your mother because (unclear) this history of my family I\u2019m not entirely sure that she really is \u2013 it\u2019s like she says that she wants to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">do this and she\u2019ll sleep through it or she\u2019ll go back to sleep and she doesn\u2019t sleep well anyway but she\u2019s so practiced at \u2013 and she didn\u2019t say exactly like this \u2013 that she\u2019s so practiced at propitiating or pleasing people that it\u2019s basically I\u2019m not sure that we can actually trust her to take care <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">of her own needs and she said it in a very \u2013 she said it in a three way conversation in a very good, direct clear way. At first when we were talking my mother said, \u2018oh no, this is completely different. This is something I\u2019m offering to do. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m knuckling under to an urgent request by you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F3\">And then later she came up to me and she said, you know, I was really, really thinking about that and I still want to do it but I appreciate very much this intervention. And you know, there had been a previous conversation \u2013 a more difficult conversation even where I can\u2019t remember exactly what she\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F4\">said \u2013 basically the content was \u2013 oh that\u2019s right, it was about Hebrew school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">And I said, you know this thing where Daddy just tried to straddle two completely different cultural and social systems, sending me to this school and you just kind of went along with it. And she said, \u2018ouch,\u2019 or something to that effect and the conversation kind of stopped and somebody started on a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">completely different topic. There\u2019s been this series of interactions about parenting and about marriage I guess, or partnership \u2013 partners is a better way to think about it in parenting, out of parenting \u2013 it\u2019s implications for parenting that are really striking, I don\u2019t know, and somehow that\u2019s bound <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">up in this ineffable mysterious process of becoming a parent and having this role or my sense of ease or I don\u2019t even know how to describe it in this role. There\u2019s something about coming to terms and the discussion and intervention that feels significant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: One thing that keeps coming up over and over again and I suspect relates is the dynamic in which there is someone else \u2013 one person really looking out for the interests of another so I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s been gratifying that you felt like reassuringly confident about is really from <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">a month from when he was born, being able to focus on what Grayson was going to need. I mean, in your mind, getting the house in order, and how you\u2019ve been with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561408\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: Literally and figuratively, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. And that sounds similar to the way that Jennie was both with you around work and your mother where she was very thoughtfully and altruistically trying to figure out what was going to be right and I find there\u2019s probably a very small echo of that between you and me where you were <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">concerned that I was, in a very kind of mild way, like questioning or slightly skeptical, when in fact I was, I think in a way kind of supportive and trying to point out that some of your \u2013 try to, you know, like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: Who\u2019s the analog of you \u2013 is my mother the analog of you in this instance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: No, I think you\u2019re the analog of you and I\u2019m the analog of Jennie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Oh yes, yes. I see what you mean. Jennie looking out for my mother you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Either Jennie looking out for your mother or Jennie looking out for you, yeah. I was to Jennie you were your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Okay, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right. In the juggling of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: It becomes very complicated at this point. Things are the things are things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so and that this was something as you point out that your father was especially data, it\u2019s a really important moment, really trying to put himself aside and see what was going to be best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: One of the blessings that we got was a very brief message, unsigned that said, \u2018love,\u2019 from my Uncle Tim, my father\u2019s brother. He sent this remarkable blessing and it was and I can remember it verbatim, \u2018May Grayson or he called him by another name, he gave him a [proceeds in Hebrew] something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">like \u2018have the same absolute commitment to truth at all costs as his grandfather.\u2019 Which was so beautiful because it was the relationship between them. There was never trouble personally but was kind of roiled by difficult family relations with Tim\u2019s wife and unwise financial partnerships. It was kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200792\">of a remarkable statement but it really does describe my father very well. I don\u2019t know about truth but he was committed to something at all costs. What I said to Jennie after I read this was my view would be that he was committed to other people acknowledging his search for truth at all costs which <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200793\">is unfair and uncharitable. He was a little more conscientious than that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">I don\u2019t know if I ever told you this but one of the things that I found and very weirdly given what an important artifact that it was, lost shortly thereafter, was in his otherwise kind of uninteresting and often duplicative papers that were in a storage unit in Worchester that I cleaned out, was a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">note that \u2013 I hope was never given to my mother in response to his affair with the graduate student \u2013 saying something like, \u2018Krissy, I love or care for you enough to tell you the truth. The truth is that I will lie; that I am not going to tell you the truth.\u2019 It was like he was crazy. I think people <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B2\">who are in very difficult situations sometimes write crazy things and I don\u2019t think it was ever sent to her, in fairness, but that was just one of the first things that came to my mind when my uncle sent his \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561408\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess that\u2019s another aspect of this that again, I think, cuts across a number of things that you\u2019ve said is the steadiness or lack of steadiness \u2013 that seems kind of like the other end of the spectrum from Marcus Aurelius there, the sort of agitation in the way that your father was overwrought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">CLIENT: My memory of him, and it\u2019s sad really, because he was in many ways really a remarkable person, was a person who was overwrought. Really, that is my memory of him. Sad. Sad that that should be what\u2019s left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">(PAUSE): [00:39:16 00:39:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: Anyway, you\u2019re right I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: I have a sense that Jennie at the moments you\u2019re describing felt pretty steady like with your mother and you when (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: Steady. What do you \u2013 steady emotionally?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like that there\u2019s a certain sort of solidity that she\u2019d have to have to be able to really think that way about what was going to be best for you or for your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: I think, right now, that she feels unstable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: Like she feels upended by parenthood and (unclear) but the reality of it is that she\u2019s very trustworthy (unclear) kinds of things even though she\u2019s not in touch with that. And I mean, it\u2019s difficult because I mean, like with the \u2013 so we named Grayson, Grayson Martin after this friend of Jennie\u2019s, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">this history professor who introduced us. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve told you about Martin. He\u2019s Alsatian. I think he came, about \u201885 he came to the U.S. in his 30s from Alsace so he was a very young boy. He was very friendly with a Brown professor and her husband who I know because I was TA\u2019ing for him after <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F2\">I got my doctorate. And I\u2019d been staying at their house for two weeks after I was previously living on the island and needed to look for a place and while I was there Martin came over to take care of their son because Robert had an overnight hospital stay so Martin and I had a talk and I went to brunch <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F3\">shortly thereafter and he in a very kind of old world way took me aside to the pantry and asked me, \u2018do you have a partner?\u2019 Very bluntly. And I said no and he said, are you interested in meeting a friend? And completely set us up. He chaperoned us on our first date and (unclear). So he came over with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F4\">his wife who \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. We should stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: Oh, shoot. I\u2019m sorry. Yeah so my mother \u2013 very quickly, my mother said something like, \u2018oh, Galen is so nurturing\u2019 and I think that has been the consensus and I think Jennie\u2019s mother said it and I think there\u2019s this endorsement of my nurturing nature and I think Jennie is not feeling very nurturing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">right now \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: I think there is something troubling to her \u2013 not in a real way, but troubling to her about the dichotomy between how she feels with her parenting and this public sort of acknowledgement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: But we should continue this another day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Monday and then not Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Right.
