Why are you finding another time on Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Two reasons. One is because I imagined you\u2019d prefer it and I had it and the other is because I knew somebody else who would prefer the morning time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Oh, that\u2019s nice. So you still got the ad hoc thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Okay. Should I pay [inaudible at 00:01:23] the thing off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right. I am happy to offer you other times than the Monday morning time if I have them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. I think it\u2019s probably going to pass but some of the reasons won\u2019t pass so it\u2019s just good to know when you have time. Yes. That is so great because Kurt, I think, is coming back on Monday and I\u2019ve been getting in well before 9:00, before 8:30, which is huge for me. Chad\u2019s been gone for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">six weeks; I think he\u2019s getting back Monday. So if I can be there around when he arrives, he gets in really early, that would make me feel really good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">It\u2019s a silly thing. I feel like maybe he won\u2019t come back up. I\u2019ll just be in early Monday morning doing cocktails. [Pause] On Monday I was really cranky about leaving. I was going to meet Jeremy at the [] (ph) .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">We\u2019ve discovered painting; it\u2019s really cool. We have all this original art from other people, six pieces, but don\u2019t really, you can\u2019t really put them up without breaking them. I\u2019m in debt now. And [inaudible at 00:05:29] to find that painting it was a creative process in itself and it\u2019s totally wide <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">open. You can pick, you can add or take away from the piece by making different decisions about the painting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re including matting and framing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. Do you want to [inaudible at 00:06:04] on your wave mat? Do you want a double mat? Do you want a triple mat? Do you want the mat to be far away? How far away from the main part of the piece? Do you want the mat to be [inaudible at 00:06:19] to the mat? Do you want to show what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">color the texture, what color frame? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Very exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: It was very exciting. We had framed most of the stuff in December but yet we had two things to pick up. And now we cannot afford to frame anything for a very long time. But that\u2019s okay because we have them in our [wall space.] (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">And yet they started to pay attention to the three [inaudible at 00:07:54] pieces that cannot inspire. The framing guy and Jeremy they won\u2019t pay attention to the [inaudible at 00:08:05]. [Pause] But this story is not as happy. I was really cranky and I started to have more space for other stuff, other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">I mean and I say that because I think this is, there\u2019s nothing new happening with me and then or my work, both things are occupying a lot more space and they have for maybe and I think there is nothing different from it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">If I complain she\u2019ll stay around and Jay is too scared. What does that look like? It looks like Allison (ph) having no capacity for any frustrations, self-frustrations and what I fear is passivity. But there was a lot of it. It started, sort of cleared up when he didn\u2019t finish this track in time for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">something, a record when he expected his friend wouldn\u2019t, just wouldn\u2019t run. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">But it\u2019s everywhere in our in daily life. I mean I don\u2019t know [pause] so Friday we\u2019re saying never mind. It\u2019s family right so let\u2019s leave at 3:30. Many times both of us would say let\u2019s have sex at 3:15 and then we\u2019d meet them a lot later. Or I want to take a nap or I want to I\u2019m busy or Jeremy won\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">have prepared at all and it would take a long time. So that\u2019s usually what the leaving looks like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">But this time I felt very, very, I was yearning to go. Really, really yearning to just go at 3:30 and I was ready. And Jeremy asked me at 2:00 I\u2019m making pasta sauce do you want any? I said I don\u2019t know. And I get home at 2:30 and I wanted to go to this meditation thing for the rest of the day. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I don\u2019t really have time for that so I\u2019m just going to be by myself in quietness for a half hour in my room. And I wasn\u2019t paying attention to [inaudible at 00:12:07].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">So I come out of me time and Jeremy is, he might as well have been inspecting the folds on the Parmesan because he is just in no hurry to do anything except really, really perfect what he\u2019s doing. So at 3:20 we tossed everything and he eats it. Jeremy is one, Jeremy can\u2019t handle the task of packing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">It\u2019s very hard for him. I don\u2019t know how much you have a sense of when I first started dating Jeremy there was, Jeremy said I have some features of ADHD. I mean he has had tons of testing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yes, a pro [inaudible at 00:13:25] problem is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes. And with that comes an IQ thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes, so Jeremy is in the genius IQ range and can\u2019t pack and can\u2019t go to the store; it\u2019s like a museum for him. And there\u2019s all these things and I think they\u2019re pretty typical but I don\u2019t really know what the label means. I\u2019ve read, when he started to get in a really bad place in college, Gwen <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">his academic coach, handed me these books and said read these. And it\u2019s something that guy who writes a bunch about the ADHD way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: [] you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes. So he has some of these books and at that time it really helped me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Are you asking me how much I have a feel for what that sort of thing could be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. I imagine you had some -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: A lot actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yes. I used to, the first five or so years as soon as I was in private practice, I did maybe a quarter or so of my time working with students who had, from elementary school through regular (ph) school who had various abilities in ADHD and that kind of thing. And most had at five I believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">but there\u2019s also a group at Yale that provides screening and sort of running support for students coming to graduate schools. So between that and just doing therapy in this neighborhood yes, I\u2019ve seen a lot of very smart people who have ADHD. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: And steady rag (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sure you had some angle on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: So I guess you have a sense of what the day to day I don\u2019t know what. There\u2019s stuff that interferes with functioning, stuff that maybe those patients complain a lot about. And then there\u2019s just what their life is like. And there\u2019s a lot of stuff about Jeremy that doesn\u2019t interfere with his <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">important tasks anymore, they used to. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff about him that\u2019s just sort of is what it is, like part of him. We don\u2019t have labels for it but <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">Anyway it\u2019s hard to label it but it\u2019s also hard to ignore the fact that many features actually do grew into sort of [inaudible at 00:17:09] chemically. Even though sometimes they seem like unrelated or <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s sort of integrated with somebody\u2019s personality. There\u2019s sort of stuff that looks more like symptoms and stuff that looks more like, because they are but it also looks kind of related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes. And so much of the symptomology has shaped how he feels about himself and who he is, a good part of just [inaudible at 00:17:42]. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a very good partner for him for those aspects of him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been. And then I think last week cleared for both of us and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">it causes a lot of rub (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: So the dinner side of it I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen somebody who had ADHD or I guess a disability who wasn\u2019t actually profoundly psychologically affected by it in terms of their personality and kind of emotional function. I would necessarily I expected that but 100% of the time -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I would expect it and then what I won\u2019t tell you about and everything I know about that. Yes, so there\u2019s just low-grade frustration. It\u2019s always there and it clears up. Like on times like Friday where I\u2019m thinking get the fuck out the door. And I\u2019ve been crying a lot and there\u2019s just all this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">angst and this is very [inaudible at 00:19:16] turbulent time, but I\u2019m crying the whole way up to Maine. I don\u2019t remember now about what, oh that we were really late, that we were going to miss dinner, we only have three dinners in Maine and [inaudible at 00:19:34].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">But we managed to recover very well. But Maine was Maine. It\u2019s so lovely. And Jeremy\u2019s parents really get him. I don\u2019t think Jeremy\u2019s mom is a good partner for Jeremy. Classic (ph) Jeremy, Jeremy [eat here] (ph) and her anxiety has interfered a great deal because like most mothers it does with their <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">children. But she was Interventionist Mom for a long time. It\u2019s really scary. It\u2019s really hard. I probably I feel like I\u2019m so eloquent to read to kids like Jeremy after so many years of knowing him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a single edge about, or more than Abby did just because I intellectually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">know things about Jeremy doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m saying fine I\u2019m not frustrated and really, really anxious about some of the stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">Anyway, she has backed off and basically he was close many times over the night. One of the times she got up and disentangled herself financially and made him pay last semester and that really helped her to say oh I\u2019m not involved sort of like [inaudible at 00:21:23]. Their relationship has gotten a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">lot better; it used to be very bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">So anyways so his parents have really got him in it. I\u2019ve noticed over the course of the whole weekend. And it is so much easier to be around them with Jeremy because it\u2019s this huge support, sense of support I didn\u2019t get. I cried a lot when we were leaving; I was very, very upset to leave. And I do <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">not just go and want to go back to Jeremy and our apartment; I didn\u2019t want to go back to our apartment. I couldn\u2019t, because this tunnel vision that comes up a lot here in other contexts where I forget all the good parts or forget even how to know about a good part. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">I was very upset when we left. It occurred to me in the car that one of the things that was very scary to me was leaving this we-know-Jeremy-well support team. It never occurred to me before but they were fans [inaudible at 00:22:44]. [Pause] Yes, so this low-grade thing sort of got really bad on Monday <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">after I got back after I left here. And Jeremy was saying he was going to get, he said what are you going to do when you get home? I said oh we\u2019re going to take [inaudible at 00:23:35]. I said go grocery shopping, I might get cheese because I really wanted more cheese on the pasta, and I said I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">more pasta. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">Somehow I fixated on the cheese on the way back from the frame store and he said okay. And I was going to get right to work when I got home. I said what are you going to do and he said I don\u2019t know. I said are you\u2019re going to get cheese? And he said I don\u2019t know; I might. I started yes you\u2019re full of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">mights aren\u2019t you? Your whole life is mights. And then Jeremy gets more and more and more and more retreat, retreat and this is habit and so it must be very, I mean I know it\u2019s very painful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">He said, Allison (ph) I never said, I never committed to getting cheese. I said I don\u2019t get it. Why don\u2019t you just get cheese? It\u2019s like taking a shower. He said you can\u2019t take a shower; you got to get in the shower. And there\u2019s this ongoing dance, I\u2019m going to take a shower now; it\u2019s not happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">in Maine. And that was the sort of thing. And I had been talking about it all just on the car ride I think. Oh that\u2019s really nice because your parents really get you. It\u2019s so nice having someone else around for something like the shower, which really bugs me when it happens in Cambridge but in Maine <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">I just, they didn\u2019t care. They all knew, we all know you might take a shower; you might not. So that\u2019s cut-like modeling for you next week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:25:40] transitions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: That are hard right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a complicated question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Okay, we\u2019ll table it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Why did you ask it just now? What are you referring to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Taking a shower, getting out of the house to go to Maine, getting home and figuring out what to do with himself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes. In that sense, yes. The answer is yes. Going to sleep, very similar. Waking up has been incredibly hard though he\u2019s much better at it than I am. So we get home and I feel very upset. I said Jeremy I don\u2019t know why this is upsetting you. This is so disproportional to what we\u2019re talking about. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">It\u2019s really dumb and it\u2019s really upsetting me. I\u2019m very, very frustrated. And I started yelling out if you don\u2019t get the cheese you\u2019re going to fail out of college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">Silence. He goes somewhere; I do something like 15 or 20 minutes of yoga and not hearing anything. Go in the bedroom, all the lights are out and Jeremy is crying. I\u2019ve seen Jeremy cry twice in nine years. And I also have this undercurrent of Jeremy\u2019s got to face the pain, Jeremy\u2019s got to face the pain, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">what is all this bullshit avoiding? Where are the tears, where\u2019s the crisis, where\u2019s the upheaval? So the crying was not really that it was premixed for me. It was very upsetting that I said what I said about the cheese being like failing college. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">So I cried a lot and joined him and we cried together. And Jeremy was giving birth to something that was extremely laborious. It wasn\u2019t this free-flowing release at all. It was an hour of every few minutes there\u2019d be a new cry. Clearly some stuff was just being really slowly stirred in a really painful way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">So I immediately, after a few minutes, immediately acknowledged that was so painful, that was so hurtful what I said to you. And I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from. There\u2019s something really, really raging in me right now and maybe actually it\u2019s time for me to just take an Ativan and go on with my day <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">and sort of not be so whatever. I haven\u2019t taken an Ativan in a year. So that was sort of my something bad is going on with me. I\u2019m considering using this other tool that I haven\u2019t used in forever. I\u2019m very, very sorry that it came out that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">Through the course of the hour Jeremy shared that I triggered a lot of bad stuff for him but that I was just a trigger and that he feels very, very bad about himself. And he has for a very long time. And there\u2019s was intermittent I had started sobbing with him. It was very painful to hear Jeremy say <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">those words. He\u2019s never said them before so I know about them that he said [inaudible at 00:30:27].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">We talked about whether it was feeling really external when people judge him and is that good enough for other people and whether it\u2019s internal. It\u2019s always been internal which I also know. He said that something that doesn\u2019t come to the surface much. He said seeing his parents makes him feel really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">really bad sometimes because he really wants them to see him happy and successful and fulfilled and they\u2019re getting old and they\u2019re going to die soon. This is what he\u2019s saying in the crying. They\u2019re getting old and they\u2019re going to die and I\u2019m not going to be [inaudible at 00:31:22] sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">I asked him if he thought that he could ever be free from his pain. He said yes. [inaudible at 00:32:08]. I had to restrain a whole bunch of stuff in myself, sort of just bringing my [inaudible at 00:32:20]. It\u2019s all forward which doesn\u2019t happen in everything. It was also really wiggly. My feet were <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">cold, I was crying and I was done crying, and I said okay, sat up, laid back down, and Jeremy was looking at me crying this whole time. It\u2019s hard to sit with someone. It was hard for me to sit with him for the hour because I wanted what was happening to happen but it was very painful to me and was making <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">me cry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">And I had a lot to say but I wasn\u2019t saying it and it\u2019s gone. It wasn\u2019t the sort of thing where I need to say it; just you need to observe it. I felt like I needed to observe it just so it would pass. I also asked him what of this if anything is at the surface. He said that he rarely feels, he\u2019s never, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">he rarely feels at all a swell like it was that night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Was he really, was it all swelled like it is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yes. But it\u2019s at the surface pretty much always, not the parent thing. But that I feel I\u2019m quite happy with myself. That\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve cried together. My thoughts are very, very tight hugging and holding. There was also a lot of not just me sitting there and him lying there. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">So he sort of softened a little since, on Monday, and since Monday I haven\u2019t noticed him going back to the sort of avoidance slash [very ending] (ph). I also said right away Jeremy it sounds like you\u2019re in a lot of pain. So that part I can tell that he\u2019s in pain many days but he has such solidified <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">habits around it. It\u2019s a very interesting contrast. I have no habits around my pain. I mean maybe pain that\u2019s on the surface. I think I have very solidified habits around keeping it below the surface, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: So I think I\u2019m getting the Jayified version of what happened, which is not a bad version. But I think it\u2019s the version where you as I think it feels like I do give a lot of space for what happened and what your reactions were and stuff. And the part of what I imagine about that is that it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">feels I think in part, I think it feels somewhat reassuring but I think it also feels in part how you have to be to stay connected to me in telling this story. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">I think you, maybe not when you step back and think about it, but as you\u2019re telling it you don\u2019t because I seem like that I\u2019m not really going to get it about how frustrated you were, how sort of conflicted around being sort of really sad or distraught over how upset he was and yet also pissed off <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">at him and frustrated at him. And that this sort of anticipation that I either won\u2019t quite get it or I will seem kind of calm and indifferent even if you are worked up, that we won\u2019t really connect around it is part of sort of what goes into creating the Jay version of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yes, well there\u2019s no other version because I haven\u2019t told anyone or really reflected much on it so this is, yes this is how it\u2019s coming onto you. I guess I\u2019m struggling to see what the alternative, what an alternative version might sound like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well here\u2019s an example of something that stood out to me in the version you told. You described sort of a number of times how he was crying and how you were crying and how sometimes you were holding him and other times you were sitting there. And there was the kind of, there was the implication <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">you were feeling a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">But you didn\u2019t say much about what those were, not that it\u2019s that hard to figure some of them out, but you weren\u2019t, clearly were not in them as you told it, I think. You may be sad and I guess my point isn\u2019t really that well geez you should be and it should be dramatic when you tell it. But more that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">I think there\u2019s a reason you keep from being in it which is it feels threatening because that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to seem and so I\u2019m going to be separate to removed. I\u2019m sorry about [inaudible at 00:40:42] bathroom [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s hard to be in it because I\u2019m more concerned with connecting with you than connecting with what happened. But I also had these two really intense dreams that I want to get to because I\u2019m a little not resting in each I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a story so it has an ending and then I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">have anything else to say about it. So there\u2019s something about that but there\u2019s an arc that makes me feel like impatient (ph) of connecting with anyone [by it] (ph) as I\u2019m telling it to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Like how? So you get through the story?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t really like telling stories period. So I\u2019ve been trying to tell it and then put on a bunch of time without any story; pretty drivy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not just drivy I think in that you want to tell me the story I imagine so that we can connect about what happened, which really matters to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yes, I guess -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I think I see what you mean by it being drivy. Story, [grumbles.] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, like I\u2019m going to do this so that, and this so that, versus so that, which there isn\u2019t much of. I guess it just occurred to me that maybe another way of being here like maybe another type of patient would use this and you as a way to connect with what happened. And I sort of feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B51\">yes, yes, I connected with what happened plenty when it happened. And I want to connect with you because I only get to see you when I need to see you. And it\u2019s sort of exciting to have something very important to me to tell you but only because, well primarily it\u2019s because it\u2019s something that I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B52\">to tell you and we can connect over it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">Yes, because it\u2019s really hard and I go through a lot of help with it but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that needs to be helped today. What feels missing to me is connecting with you, not yes. Or it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s missing but that\u2019s what fuels it, like the point of being here for me today. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">And there\u2019s the other stuff but really it doesn\u2019t, it kind of doesn\u2019t know at that level. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Like what matters to you is sharing what happened with me? Not your own relationship with what happened? Not saying it matters at all but just not as much as [focused on] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yes I mean I think the sharing takes up so much room that I don\u2019t have any yes, maybe in two minutes I want my relationship to make more matter. Somehow it\u2019s feeling very laborious to pass easy information. I don\u2019t know what, it\u2019s hard to tell what to tell you and how fast and how much to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">editorialize and how much do I have to say about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to come here and have something happen and want to discuss it and care mostly about connecting with you. And still have to say words one after another that forms some story that we can discuss. That\u2019s a hard thing. It never feels very grateful the way I do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yes, there\u2019s an aesthetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: There must be. I don\u2019t know what that looks like but I feel like I\u2019m learning an art or something. The most bizarre art ever, it feels very bizarre; it feels very specific from you and me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Framing, you\u2019re talking about framing? Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: In this dream on Tuesday night is that he and I are lying in bed, it was nighttime and our bedroom has these bay windows facing [inaudible at 00:50:19] Street and our shades were not drawn. And there were these scary men prowling outside, right outside the window. And Jeremy was pleading with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">me, can we please put the shades down and can you come back to bed and can we hold each other really tight because I\u2019m really scared of these men? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">And in the dream I said no, I\u2019m going to leave the shades up and I\u2019m going to go, and then the doorbell rings. And I said I\u2019m going to go see if they need help. Jeremy said no. I run to the door, or I walk I don\u2019t know what it wasn\u2019t clear what my attitude about the men was but they were intruders, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C71\">they were coming to do something very bad to us. And I let them in and in some other part of the dream there was one and in some other part of the dream there were three.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">And Jeremy had this straight razor and he was behind them and I had disappeared. He was trying to cut their face as they came in. He was so, he said he\u2019s never this is the most intense dream he\u2019s ever had which I believe because he rarely remembers his dreams and he rarely <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Oh so you\u2019re talking about by the time you ride the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">CLIENT: Monday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: The [inaudible at 00:51:47] was Monday night; the dream was Tuesday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">CLIENT: So he said he was so intensely angry with me in the dream. That was the overall main feeling. He was so afraid of being mad but he was so angry with me. He was so alarmed by his anger after waking up. And the other part of the dream is that we were together and he there\u2019s this checkerboard <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D51\">and we were supposed to be putting rice, I was supposed to be putting rice on black squares and maybe he was supposed to be putting rice on the white squares. And I said oh I\u2019m going to put them on every square; I\u2019m just going to put them where I want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">I can\u2019t imagine why, why I would act that way in his dream. Wait, I don\u2019t put them on every square, sorry. Jeremy says no you don\u2019t get the rules. You\u2019re breaking all the rules, Allison (ph). He was so mad and so combined somehow he gets very, very, very angry sometimes when I break rules. So he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">really, really affected and he told me all about the dream yesterday night. It affected him all throughout the day. He said clearly I have some major anxieties around you messing up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Wait, he said to you clearly he had some anxieties [inaudible at 00:53:49] you messing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yes, messing up stuff. Messing stuff up. He said I\u2019m sorry -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">THERAPIST: End of the line, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry and I will continue to notice and I\u2019ll try to work on it. And I said yes you do. He said I\u2019m pretty sure that I get the brunt of it. So he thinks that I think that he gets the brunt of his anxiety about messing stuff up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m getting a little confused. He gets the brunt of his anxiety about you messing things up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">CLIENT: So I get a bunch of it; he\u2019s anxious that I\u2019m going to mess stuff up. But I think maybe there is something that I\u2019m missing in between where we reflected about how he\u2019s pretty scared about being, my not being perfect. And then he said that he gets, whatever that is in him he gives it to himself <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">much harder, much worse. Oh I think he I said yes, you have some pretty intense anxieties around my messing stuff up and it can be pretty corrosive. And he said yes that I get the brunt of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Oh I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">CLIENT: In college we had the one time I expressed doubt about us making out all the time in college but he expressed it one day one time. And it was this day where he got really, really, really, really upset that I was not perfect. That\u2019s how he describes it. He realized that I was not perfect and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">this for some reason presented a huge problem to him. And when he finally came to me about it he was very upset. I\u2019m playing the card of an adult and I really wish I had a different card. He said Allison (ph) I think you are very wise. And that difference between us, maybe I wish I was perfect and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E92\">don\u2019t know, but that difference has always been pretty <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yes I think that relates to my confusion a couple minutes ago. To me I heard his dream being about to the extent it\u2019s about you per se, just in terms of boundaries and crossing lines and wanting to let pain in that he feels are very dangerous. And he seemed to, because I know you but his <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB1\">focus seemed a lot on you were doing things wrong I guess or you were messing up. And I bring that up because I would so not imagine that to be your focus or how you would hear the dream per se in terms of you that I get what you mean about how he\u2019s really focused on nothing ever being perfect and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB2\">doesn\u2019t seem so much to be a good thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t care. Yes, I mean maybe we\u2019ll figure out that I do but I really don\u2019t think I care that much. He is very bothered when I, I don\u2019t know. Twenty examples today, I can\u2019t transfer stuff from one container to another without spilling. This happens in the kitchen all the time. I spill <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED1\">some; I don\u2019t clean it up right away. Or I track dirt around the house or I let olive oil drip down the bottle, I don\u2019t close bottles properly, I don\u2019t hang the towels so it\u2019ll dry off, all this stuff, blah, blah, blah. So there\u2019s a lot of stuff that comes up around my not doing stuff perfectly for him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yes, and he probably knows already about the options that you don\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s OCD but often folks with ADHD have to struggle with OCD stuff because it\u2019s so hard to regulate some of these, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yes. No, no, yes I do know about it but I want to hear what you have to say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Oh just that it can involve such a struggle for folks with that to sort of pull it together because it takes so much energy and force that sometimes that kind of spills over in little obsessive or compulsive things. Like my room\u2019s a mess but dammit when I clean it everything has got to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F31\">just so, or it has to be completely clean because I feel like such a mess inside that things out of place means I\u2019m going to fall apart. Yes, I have to have such strong high standards because otherwise I\u2019m just not motivated enough to really get done what needs to get done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: That is true. I think that\u2019s his biggest struggle right now. The OCD stuff has come and gone I mean he\u2019s got an uncle who really was debilitated by OCD. His mom\u2019s got a friend that [inaudible at 01:00:33]. There\u2019s a lot of humor and there\u2019s a lot of lightness and there\u2019s a lot of insight in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F51\">my opinion into it in his family. Yes, so I don\u2019t hear the dream as in terms of what it says about me. I, yes I pay much more attention to the fact that I\u2019m breaking rules all the time and I love it what it\u2019s doing to Jeremy. But for him it, he was very upset about his anxiety about my messing up was <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F52\">so prominent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">We had talked about during the car ride home about I don\u2019t know I wanted him to agree to socialize regularly and not involve or express that I\u2019m being very respectful to him by not bringing people up to the house unless he wants it. But he never wants it so it\u2019s very stressful to me. So he thinks that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">was part of the intruder dream. But we talked a bunch about feeling like the protector of our house and our family for him, how he feels that way; that he needs to provide and protect. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">THERAPIST: I was going to say that I don\u2019t know how relevant it is to say something about his dream but I mean the thing that comes sort of jumping out at me is how much you want him to open the doors and windows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. No, that\u2019s a new way of looking at that. I\u2019m agreeing with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yes for all, I mean and that is actually what happens on Monday night. You let a whole bunch of stuff in that he usually doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s overwhelming and awful and painful, scary. And you, I\u2019m sure he picks up how you want him to make space for all these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yesterday I could tell that he was so, being so nice to me because of how badly he felt about the dream. When I thought that I was telling him for the first time, apparently I was telling him for the third time, Jay has said early on, not recently, that he could recommend somebody if you ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF1\">wanted to switch therapists, which he said to me early on. And that\u2019s really not a place I should go with Jeremy any more. But I did and I got there\u2019s an emoticon, there\u2019s a back emoticon. It\u2019s an arrow going to the left and it says back on it, and that\u2019s all I got for him. And I got a couple of warning, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF2\">danger signs, a little [inaudible at 01:04:07]. And that\u2019s I\u2019m out, that was a very mild response for him. I could tell the dream had impacted him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">But yes, I am always, I am way over the top without opening up and making changes with him and he can tell. Yes, but in some ways I feel really dumb because it\u2019s missing the point to try and chart somebody\u2019s dream for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">THERAPIST: Well, I suspect that it\u2019s some of the same things and I think it\u2019s an elaboration of what we\u2019ve been talking about with driving the bus. Some of the same things I think that make what he\u2019s struggling with hard for you and frustrating and what lead you to sort of this aesthetic of how you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">talk here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">CLIENT: What do you mean? I get that bus aesthetic part; I don\u2019t get how it relates to what bothers me about him other than when I\u2019m trying to drive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">THERAPIST: Right. [Pause] I guess what I had in mind was that he\u2019s kind of not operating in the arcs you\u2019re comfortable with. Like you want the arc to be you get home, get the cheese, do this and do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">CLIENT: Yes but I don\u2019t say it. There\u2019s a very strange attachment thing that is something about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Right. I guess I also want to be clear I don\u2019t mean to be putting all of your frustration with this with him on you or talking it all out to your being neurotic or bus drivy or whatever. That\u2019s not what I had in mind. But I do think there\u2019s some of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yes I could imagine being, I could imagine a better partner or being a better partner even if nothing in Jeremy had change I could imagine myself changing in a way that would cause less suffering. So yes I own that, I own that to [inaudible at 01:08:36].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Yes. I guess the reason I said an elaboration of bus drivy is, it\u2019s not as simple as when you\u2019re telling something in here that you want to be in control of how you\u2019re telling it. I mean that\u2019s part of it but it\u2019s more particular. It\u2019s right, I guess as we talked about it\u2019s sort of protecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F1\">against the helplessness of not knowing how well you will connect with me if you just talk. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2010E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20111\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20113\">CLIENT: The only thing is just that I think also the separation digs up [inaudible at 01:10:02] for him and just talking requires a kind of a space around what I\u2019m talking about in my experience. When I\u2019ve been able to just talk, it\u2019s usually when I\u2019m not afraid and dreading and brooding or incredibly <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201131\">aware of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20115\">THERAPIST: I guess you\u2019re afraid of having to leave before you really felt close enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20117\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause] That\u2019s why I get to, yes, yes, whatever that means attainable or unattainable. [Pause] Yes a lot of times it feels really close enough to not be so preoccupied with it or with leaving. It\u2019s not really something that I\u2019m [going to get.] (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20119\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011B\">THERAPIST: I still guess it\u2019s on me. I\u2019m not available in the right way. [Pause] I think now you\u2019re kind of feel like you\u2019re right there and I don\u2019t see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yes I\u2019m here. I\u2019m open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20121\">THERAPIST: And I guess because I kind of bend intermittently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20123\">CLIENT: Yes. You mean in some ways you were completely unavailable and in inappropriate ways?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20125\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m smiling because I can hear that either way. I think I know what you mean. I\u2019m not available for things that aren\u2019t appropriate but I think what you actually said was unavailable in inappropriate ways, so I\u2019m being inappropriate when I\u2019m being available. [Laughs] It\u2019s not a big deal I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201251\">just thought that was funny. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20127\">CLIENT: I see. But it is inappropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20129\">THERAPIST: Of me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yes to not be available in those ways. But yes, I mean appropriate ways. Yes, that feels during one level of the appropriate way is really constant, you\u2019re always available. And there\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff in between that goes into what you say. [Pause] I don\u2019t know what my role is through <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B1\">Jeremy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking, I think yes I pose the same problem for you that way actually. So much of the stuff you can\u2019t do in a way is stuff he would also be doing for you. Like gee guys [inaudible at 01:19:27] for both of you. Like his getting through college I bet made a huge difference for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yes, it was everything; his figuring out his creative process to the extent that he can make music, his being happy. I mean it\u2019s all about some of it is him doing stuff but other parts of it is he\u2019s happy for both of us, he\u2019s happy for <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20131\">THERAPIST: I know I sort of get this thing for you with both he and I in a way. You I think feels like sort of love is kind of all you need. So you\u2019re saying hey guys I love you guys so what the hell else do you need and where the hell are you. What else could possibly be going on that actually matters <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201311\">nearly as much as that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20133\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t think, that\u2019s funny but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it all on me. You both also love me and I don\u2019t see what more their needs, what more needs to happen for either of you.

I don\u2019t expect too much from a lot of that love and in some ways those are much healthier loves, maybe for that reason. But yes, there\u2019s this really, really strong expectation that I attach to both of you in really similar ways and [inaudible at 01:22:46] <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201431\">ways that shows up when I think about how you love me too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20145\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20147\">Yes, there\u2019s kind of like a doomsday feel to both of it, to both of you. If Jeremy doesn\u2019t figure out some way to be more accepting and more fulfilled with something that [inaudible at 01:24:00] very much about work, we\u2019re going to die. I mean we\u2019re going to die anyway but we\u2019re going to die of it; <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201471\">it may kill us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20149\">And that\u2019s, I think it\u2019s true. It\u2019s pretty dramatic but I think it\u2019s true. It\u2019s like what I felt but it\u2019s much more like a [inaudible at 01:24:33] check on my fear. Like if you don\u2019t figure out how to express your love to me it\u2019s going to kill me and you. And similarly I can\u2019t really put into words <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201491\">what it is but it\u2019s going to kill me and you [inaudible at 01:25:13].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yes I imagine there\u2019s some you probably can feel it, something hard to get to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yes, I think that\u2019s really important that it\u2019s hard to get to. [Pause] It\u2019s [inaudible at 01:26:13] and it\u2019s happening for me today. Not so much shit right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014F\">THERAPIST: You what? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20151\">CLIENT: My bladder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">THERAPIST: Oh. You have to pee?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20155\">CLIENT: Yes in a same really, really, sudden way that I start shivering less. You went to the bathroom today and last week. I\u2019m just noticing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yes, so the same thing might be happening to me? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20159\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015B\">THERAPIST: I see. I\u2019m having a somatic reaction?

I\u2019m saying it seems to me you may be projecting what may be going on with you onto me. So if you could explain what\u2019s going on with me, maybe that will <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20161\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20163\">CLIENT: I won\u2019t make any bets with you about the reasons you have to pee today.

Sometimes I think he was right that I am a most difficult patient. I was just thinking oh, Jay didn\u2019t give Jeremy what he needs. It wouldn\u2019t be inappropriate. I mean I don\u2019t think anyone can give Jeremy what he needs except for Jeremy but it\u2019s much more than you can give me what I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201671\">which is entirely inappropriate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20169\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ve got five minutes. [Pause] So I think that things that have happened in the last couple minutes are a reaction to the thought about the sort of two-parter, which was one if I can\u2019t find some appropriate way, or let\u2019s just say some way to express to you how I love you then it\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201691\">to be catastrophic and we will die. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562290\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016B\">Part two is, and I think this is probably the scary part, that you have some fantasy or thought that we don\u2019t know of yet to how that would happen, how that catastrophe will come about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016D\">CLIENT: Oh.

Or what Jeremy would do or say. I think part of it is that I don\u2019t think I have anything in the world that would completely alleviate my anxiety that comes from somebody else. But, yes, but then it sort of feels like there is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20173\">THERAPIST: Right. I see so maybe it was sort of how that would come into contact with reality that made you nervous and had to pee.
