So maybe we should start there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: (pause at 00:00:26 to 00:00:33) It's been a weird week. I mean I felt weird all week. There is something that basically tasked myself to produce but I announced it to a lot of people. And I'm having a bit of trouble doing it. I'm feeling kind of my typical like the last time I was talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">to you about the outline. And now there is like one section that I've totally (inaudible at 00:00:59) out. (inaudible) And I'm really, really struggling with it. And I think struggling with managing uncertainty. The uncertainty about kind of my institutional status and stuff. (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Whether there is budget for a medium term. How effective my interactions have been and generally how to read other peoples' interactions with me. Just stuff that we've talked ad nauseum about as far as I'm concerned. But really struggling with it to the point where I mean for me schedule is almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">(inaudible at 00:02:09). And I kind of lost my sense of where I was in the space time continuum. So it was weird. For awhile now I've been getting up on Wednesday and Friday and somehow was (inaudible at 00:02:30). I was feeling upset and kind of alienated or concerned. And somehow that made it very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">difficult to (inaudible).  (pause until 00:02:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I guess the other piece (sighs) well we're kind of managing our interaction about the bill and stuff. So there is that. And I think that was that's been an issue although I guess I'm struggling with that. With that little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I feel likenot in a way that I would care to talk about under normal circumstances if I weren't trying to understand why I feel disrupted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: But since there is a very dramatic and expensive symptom of my disruption I guess I wonder about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Among other things the immediate effect is to add to my bill. So I struggle with it a bit. I think the thing about billing is just so lousy. It just kind of makes me mad. Just the whole system makes me mad. Having it turned back to me I guess at some level makes me kind of pissed off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So maybe that was a little bit disruptive. And I think I generally felt disrupted this week. And I'm not quite sure it's very familiar on one hand and it's a little scary on the other as we talked about last week. And I'm just struggling with how to manage it. And a little chagrined I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">that it seems apparently so (inaudible at 00:05:11). (pause until 00:05:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It seemed to me pretty abstract that you're going through all this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Uh -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I'm not saying you don't feel it. I have the impression that you do. And that you know sort of pretty clearly the (inaudible at 00:05:37) detail that you're referring to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: My description doesn't really convey those. Well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah I mean both with the billing stuff where I know (inaudible at 00:06:01) specifics obviouslyand I'm smiling because (inaudible at 00:06:13).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: But also about the stuff with work. (pause at 00:06:23 to 00:06:35) And we know this happens sometimes. Especially when you're feeling kind of disrupted. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107307\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: The experience of it is not clear from this description at least. I think that's what you're saying. I'm still kind of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Two things yeah. One is that. And the other is I wonder how that fits together with your being disrupted. Why is that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Let me be a little bit more immediate still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: And just tell you that as I told that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: to you a moment ago. As I sort of brought all of these threads together and conveyed them in these abstract terms I felt satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: The immediate sensation that I had the immediate feeling that I had was kind of the opposite of disruption. It was like, \"Oh good. That was good. That was effective. You kind of conveyed what was going on.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Which may in fact not be true. I mean this may be symptomatic or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You did convey some of what was going on. I mean do feel like I have a high level overview.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: So I feel it was very satisfying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: And I think that part of the satisfaction is turning my frown upside down. You know? (chuckles) Turning to what was really a somewhat terrifying experience into a package that a) could be understood by another person. B) made sense in the context of our interaction so at least it was sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">(inaudible at 00:08:36) information. And C) wasn't dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: And for that for those purposes a high level overview as you put it in this calculus seemed indicated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: The other option or one other . Another option would just to be just to kind of describe the experience itself. (pause at 00:09:21 until 00:09:28) Well I have less facility (inaudible). And feel less chance of success than these three threads. (pause at 00:09:40 until 00:10:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I mean I imagine that you anticipate there being something about the terror or frustration that go along with the things that you were describing that would make it hard to lay things out with more kind of specifics.  (pause until 00:11:06)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: We've talked about this. And one implication would seem to be it's also hard to engage in analytic exercise (inaudible at 00:11:18 to 00:11:20). I think I've told you this. When I'm really feeling very powerfully affected by this complex, one of the things that I've done in the past intuitively <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">it's not something that I sort of read anywhere, although I've later discovered it's an actual exercise is just automatic writing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: But not I think the way that it's usually prescribed. Which is to say just whatever. Write about what you're feeling or what's going through your head. Or whatever. But it comes out as kind of gibberish. It's like (inaudible at 00:12:19) probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: It's like a paragraph or half a page or something of just words strung together. Just write anything at all just to keep writing. You know? As if there is something -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Like that will kind of help you get into the groove where suddenly you (inaudible at 00:12:49) start making sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Maybe. I mean I think it's a more other directed than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107307\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It's like I've got to be productive at some superficial level. Some visible level. And just keep writing. And have to (inaudible at 00:13:09). Things. (pause at 00:13:12 to 00:13:27) Sometimes there is some self-observation that takes place as well. Least little I don't know what to call them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">They're real words. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Syntax is very weird but isn't that consistent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: So yeah. This is an alternative to that I guess. It's abstract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Kind of in between (inaudible at 00:14:12).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's funny to do this fairly high level exercise on par with what feels like (inaudible at 00:14:31) in a very different pattern of thought. But yeah. (pause at 00:14:34 until 00:14:49) I mean there were a couple of things that I turn to for relief. One is some kind of an escape. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">Often just a behavior even though there is an interaction with somebody in which I can sort lance my anxiety. Preferably the person who is serving as the interjected that particular moment. Third is and in that category . Well not only actual interaction with that person like getting a hold of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D2\">them but writing something to them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: A note or a letter or something. Something that serves that purpose of having contact. And generally what is provoking this at one level or another is a fear that the connection has been (inaudible at 00:16:03). We've talked about that. And the third is this kind of high level that I'm engaging <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">in at this very moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: And of the three, this feels productive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: But the other two feel very often you know sometimes to be as satisfied would be actually interacting with a person. Ascertaining for certain that we're still okay. But this is satisfying. I know how to do this. This reminds me that I'm still capable of engaging (inaudible at 00:17:00). And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">somehow the capacity to engage in the analysis makes the feeling itself okay. Which doesn't necessary follow obviously. But somehow <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: This is part of the complex I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Okay. So my turfing the billing to you pissed you off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: (sighs) (chuckles) Um, your turfing the billing to me I mean I was immediately angry at the insurance company. I mean you know they're providing me a service for which I pay handsomely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Handsomely. More handsomely this month than last month for example. And the fact that they're so fucking incompetent has led me to have to assume a fairly onerous duty. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: A fairly onerous duty. I mean it feels really egregious. So I was pretty mad about that. I don't know. I mean I think in my rational (inaudible at 00:18:32) I certainly find it very difficult to be angry at you for anything related to billing since we've been around the block on this. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">we've (inaudible at 00:18:45) quite frankly. And I appreciate that. And so I think over the course of our interaction about this-over the last couple of weeks there probably have been moments where I said, \"Oh God dammit.\" Saying that I was angry at you is exceeding what I'm willing to cop to probably. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107307\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: But there were probably moments when I said, \"Oh God dammit, Ethan is turfing the billing back to me.

It sounds like I'm not meaning to look away from that but it sounds like what you have stronger feelings about go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: One thing that I thought of in that connection that I think probably does bear inspection about our interaction. And that is that it's very hard for me to reconcile the kind of sort of genuine emotional connection that's necessary for this thing to work between us and payment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: You know this kind of classic Freudian tension. (inaudible at 00:20:15) beginning the treatment like in shrink school anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You mean like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: The essay in which he talks about how empathy is really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: I have like an ideological objection to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: And I think that at some level it pisses me off. I feel like this essential function should not be mediated by commerce and market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: And that sounds like a very cold kind of ideal for this. Ideological framing of the issue but I think it's a lot more visceral. It's like how can this be real and meaningful if what it's really about is payment? And I have some resistance to that. Anxiety about that. Concern about that. It feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">like somehow it makes our interaction less valuable. Paradoxically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: So I think there is some of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: And that's kind of a general issue that's brought to the fore anytime that my (inaudible at 00:21:35) comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. (pause at 00:21:36 until 00:21:53) Yeah I mean you look kind of moved talking both about your frustration with the insurance company especially given how much you pay them and about my sort of restraint or patience or whatever it is about the billing. As you were talking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">(pause at 00:22:18 until 00:22:29)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: (sighs) Yeah. As I was thinking about all of this what occurred to me is that I have difficulty with payment in general. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: I have reservations and concerns. Anxieties about the money economy in general. Like I was talking I don't know, a week ago or so about my own billing and how that's difficult for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: So maybe part of what is going on here is my unease with the money economy. I don't know. (inaudible at 00:23:11) there are culture (inaudible) issues (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: But yeah. I was moved by both of the things that you mentioned. (inaudible at 00:23:27) What do you make of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I think they both strike me as having to do with somewhat in a way being there for you or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: (sighs) (pause at 00:23:56 until 00:24:17) I guess so. It's funny. When you put it that way if one is going to get actually angry at somebody then naturally you have to personify them somehow. Right? So I mean I guess my initial impulse is to say, \"Well you know the insurance company is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">kind of like this faceless bureaucracy. I'm not sure if not being there for me is a kind meaningful construction of the way that they operate.\" But I guess at some level it is indeed the case that I was and am angry at them then I must be doing that somehow. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107307\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Can't be angry at I don't know. I seem to be angry at the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: There is an analogy going on there but anyway. Yeah I guess I'm angry at the system. Genuinely, legitimately angry. Genuinely, meaningfully angry. That's the word I'm looking for. Meaningfully angry at the system. And I'm stuck in it. And I'm trying to navigate it and I'm in a position where <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">I'm sort of in the incipient phases of kind of coming to terms with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: And here it is not being there for me and I'm pissed. Just pissed. It's kind of a classic situation really. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: For you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: For me and in general. It's like the system proves not to be set up in certain way (inaudible at 00:26:16). (laughter) It's set up in order to serve somebody else's profit imperative. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: And yet I mean my sense from your overview last week was that it wasn't and isn't so much a matter of the level of reimbursement that they were offering it's that they're so erratic. You know? You kind of can't you have no idea of what you're going to get. And that was the problem. The problem <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">was their erratic-ness. The erratic nature of their engagement. It isn't even so much that the rules of the game are kind of rigged against me and against you and whatever and against our interaction that they're supposed to be facilitating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: In theory. It's that they're doing in incompetently and yet their incompetence they're shielded from the consequences of their own incompetence. Completely. The outcome is not that they're punished. The outcome is that I'm punished. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: The outcome is not that you're punished. The outcome is that I'm punished. Your punishment is now over. (laughter) And my punishment has begun. So yeah. So there is anger. I'm frustrated to be sure. I feel disgusted etc. There is genuine emotion there. For (inaudible at 00:27:48). (sighs) Yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">But this is kind of I mean I don't know. This too feels productive. My response to it. In other words I'm angry and it's leading to some kind of analysis. And the analysis (inaudible at 00:28:14) punished but and failing that (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:28:23) rant at the machine and you feel a little bit better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: But it's the same I guess what I'm trying to say is at some level it's the same emotional process as the one that I described at the outside of our discussion today. It's taking something that's just sort of upsetting, disruptive something that led me at some level, at some measure on Wednesday <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F91\">just to completely forget where I was and to give it words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: To give it shape. To give it some kind of contours that I can relate to. Rather than contours that not only can't I relate to somehow but that disrupt me so much that I can't relate to anything else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Now is that the most constructive response? I'm not sure. But it's a very well worn it's a very well trodden path for me. In other words this is probably the most constructive mechanism that I've come up with over the last forty-one years to manage what for me is a very difficult emotional state.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20100-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20100-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2107307\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Anger or what have you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: And I think there is more we can say about the similarity to other instances like this than what you just said. In that it's the same story. You've been abandoned by someone or an institution that was sort of supposed to be operating in part at a concern for your interest but has failed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201071\">Or disappointed you in some way related to that. And that leads to the anxiety, the disorientation, the anger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I'm sorry. Like my initial impulse is to divert. And to move from this crucial kind of process to (inaudible at 00:30:48). (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Well go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: (laughing) It's an interesting impulse I had. (laughing) (inaudible at 00:30:56) That's not why we're here. No I guess what flashed through my mind (inaudible at 00:31:02) world shaking, unprecedented insight it's just that when you have shareholders . By that very fact the incentive structure <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">is wrong. So when a service is provided by an organization that has shareholders that is oriented toward capital literally it skews the incentive structure away from actually providing services and being accountable to provide those services to providing dividends and being accountable to provide <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D2\">those dividends. I mean whatever it's sort of a basic, obvious thing to say but it's just a very clear contrast between two different incentive structures. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: One of which involves accountability to what you're (inaudible at 00:31:50) providing and the other which involves accountability to in other words providing services suddenly becomes a bit of a sham. So I don't know that that's relevant to the more intimate kind of interactions we're talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:32:06) strikes me about me about it and I bring it up only because it may have some parallel in the more intimate setting is (pause at 00:32:16 until 00:32:25) . I mean that incentive structures are yoked together. Because what you're describing presupposes that you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201131\">fool people or they're somehow hostage. Which is sort of the case with health care. Like health insurance to some extent for the consumer into sort of thinking they're getting something that's worth more than what they're getting or they're a sort of hostage. And can't go elsewhere to get it at a better <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201132\">value. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: So the analogy is to my family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">THERAPIST: Well I don't know. Like in other words when you say when you have shareholders it sort incentivizes benefiting the wrong people that's only true in so far presuming you've got to keep the customers coming back. Otherwise there is no way to make the shareholders happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">CLIENT: Well the customers in this case are over a barrel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Well that's yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: I mean it's like you have three options.

In that sense -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:39:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: That's kind of the opposite. It's not that I don't feel that you're supporting me in that respect, rather what I remember is instances in which you did. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:39:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: Do I worry about whether you will or not? I'm not aware of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Another of way of saying it is that it's not so much whether a worry about whether I'm on your side or not as whether you're on your side or not. Whether you're -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. No that seems I mean I enjoy our conversations but at the end of the day (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Yeah I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Or rather the end of the therapeutic hour for that matter. Which I'm guessing we're (inaudible at 00:40:07) upon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: We've got (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: Got a little time. Yeah so I don't know. I like the way that we interact. And one of the reasons that I like it is that I feel very unconflicted. Maybe unusually so. About that I feel very goal oriented and I don't worry about that so much. Where in most interactions they're kind of larded <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201851\">over three times over-with these kinds of concerns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">CLIENT: Does X feel like I am Y? Does Y feel like I am justified or behaving appropriately or what have you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">CLIENT: So it's actually as I think about it it's a little bit remarkable and I think a testament to our ability to set up a useful therapeutic encounter that I don't feel that at all. That I'm consciously (inaudible at 00:41:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Well good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: But it's interesting because it's unusual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yep. (pause at 00:41:22 until 00:41:51)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: I mean with (inaudible at 00:41:52) I don't feel that. My sister I don't feel that. I mean I think I think (inaudible) gets frustrated at times probably with the extent to which I don't feel worried about that. (inaudible at 00:42:03) I'll behave more cavalierly. (inaudible) Here again we've <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201951\">set up we've established a kind of rapport that involves me not worrying about that as much as I might with other people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: And she noticed this is a new tangent to strike out in at the eleventh hour but she complained to me the other day that when we were visiting her mother I was just impeccably clean or orderly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">CLIENT: And when I'm at home I'm not. And I think that's related. I think that particular complaint is related. And one of the things that she observed about this past week was that I was disorderly in a way that she associates with (inaudible at 00:43:04) disruption. And I think that's the same thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D1\">going on there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: When there wasn't mediating my disruption.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: And not mediating my disruption meant among other things that I wasn't worrying about whether she thought I was justified. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: If you see the (inaudible at 00:43:28) of my thought there.
