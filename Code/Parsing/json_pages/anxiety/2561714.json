I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Well I kind of know what\u2019s going on. This weather\u2019s not helping. Like I\u2019m absolutely I feel surreal. This is like unbearable. But yeah, I got a I\u2019m doing the very thing I said I didn\u2019t want to do, with this Allison chick. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">I got I think I\u2019ve got to like take her off my Face not unfriend her, but somehow you know what I mean? Because I\u2019m it\u2019s not something is off. I think she either I don\u2019t know. Something\u2019s off, and I don\u2019t want to start feeling like I\u2019m being a weirdo, or I\u2019m trying too hard or because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">I\u2019m starting to feel that way. And I don\u2019t like that. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Something\u2019s off meaning she\u2019s not responding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Well this morning she\u2019s the one who contacted me. [00:01:00.23] I think what ends up happening is it\u2019s not that she won\u2019t contact she\u2019ll contact me sometimes before I contact her, but then I eventually somewhere along the chat I\u2019ll try to kind of I mean I\u2019m trying, right? I mean I\u2019ve got <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">to do something. I don\u2019t want to just be like a buddy. So I try these little ways to open things up a little bit. I\u2019ll either flirt in a kind of sexual way but in a funny way or whatever, without being weird. Or I\u2019ll say something just honest, you know what I mean? I\u2019ll just but then I\u2019ll make a joke <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">right after it or something. And she just she doesn\u2019t really engage in any of those. She immediately deflects or just doesn\u2019t respond or I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like I\u2019m starting to feel like a chump now. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m some of that might be that old stuff where every little thing I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">I\u2019m being a chump when I\u2019m not. But I don\u2019t know. [00:02:00.25] It just makes me sad and why is this so some childish things like why can\u2019t this just work out or why can\u2019t it and then I feel really angry that I\u2019m feeling this way again and sad that like it\u2019s like in some ways it\u2019s like this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">right back where you started kind of thing. Even though I know it\u2019s not. I know I\u2019m very different right now. But I\u2019ve just been feeling sad all day. I just feel like I\u2019m I don\u2019t have much to do; I\u2019m just kind of meandering. I can\u2019t I\u2019m having trouble concentrating. I know a lot of people I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">it\u2019s brutal outside, but I don\u2019t know. I just feel sad. I feel lonely and sad and stupid for feeling this way when I know it\u2019s kind of irrational. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Something old\u2019s happening in this, though, that I when you\u2019re so quick to say stupid, like [inaudible] so much more [inaudible] know about it that isn\u2019t so obvious. [00:03:18.14] You were starting to talk about yesterday, what if one of the reasons you were falling so hard for her was that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">there was something aloof, something Samantha like in other words then would be predictably would play out like this. And what is that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I mean well what it is, I think, is it just goes back to that old thing of like I mean some of it\u2019s just what everybody has, which is you want something you can\u2019t have. So then you want it more. But some of it\u2019s just a much deeper there\u2019s a certain she fits that kind of person that I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">validation from. [00:04:03.07] You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: You said particularly that she was beguiling, which is a very it\u2019s not a straightforward loving easily loving, straightforward loving kind of character, right? There\u2019s something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not just normal hard to get. It\u2019s like particularly hard to get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Characterologically. Or particularly excited about being hard to get or playing hard to get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: There might be that too, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I mean I don\u2019t mean that consciously necessarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: No, she even like today, this is where things a little bit went off the rail today. Like we were joking, or I don\u2019t know what the fuck was going on, and I think I don\u2019t know what I said, but I don\u2019t remember what the fuck I said. [00:05:01.02] Oh, she said, when you go to Guitar Center buy <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">me a tuner for my guitar, whatever. And I said something like, I\u2019m not buying you shit; you have to I mean she didn\u2019t she was joking, of course, but then I was like you\u2019ve got to earn that shit. I\u2019m not buying you a god damn thing. It was something like that. And we laughed. And then she was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">no, no, I didn\u2019t she was like no, no, I didn\u2019t really need a tuner. I don\u2019t really need a tuner. My tuner\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just I think I could do better. Something like that. I was like dude, I was like listen man. I was like you\u2019ve got to slowly like I don\u2019t know how I said it, but I was like you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">got to slowly take off or not take off. I used a different word. I was like you\u2019ve got to slowly do something about the armor you got going on. I was like that doesn\u2019t kind of work with me because I have the same armor. So I was like I\u2019m not buying you a tuner. Don\u2019t worry about it. [00:06:00.21] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">But you know what I mean? It\u2019s just like very quick, like she can\u2019t handle any little either honest, just an honest feeling that she can engage in instead of just going ha ha ha or smiley face or some shit. Or, and\/or, it\u2019s just yeah, it\u2019s she\u2019s not I can tell she\u2019s not there\u2019s something not very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200255\">reciprocal about her in general I think, maybe. She\u2019s a really nice person, I think, but yeah, I think she does have that maybe that is part of the beguiling thing. It\u2019s like she won\u2019t go that much out of her way or something. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t explain it. But it started from that little part, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200256\">like then suddenly her responses just stopped. Not that I\u2019ve been texting her the whole day, but every few hours or whatever. And now it\u2019s just very kind of now it\u2019s kind of weird, and I\u2019m like all right, well, whatever. [00:07:05.10] Now the other thing that upsets me about all this is who the fuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200257\">cares. I mean this is what I\u2019m doing on a Friday, you know what I mean? She could be busy, she could be I mean you know what I mean? She\u2019s not sitting there engaging with me. She\u2019s living her life. You know what I mean? However, I think those two things aren\u2019t mutually you know what I mean? Both <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200258\">things are happening I think. There\u2019s definitely something I feel like I don\u2019t know. Something\u2019s off kilter, that\u2019s all I can...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s some of that that could be you\u2019re feeling paranoid about, right? That\u2019s probably some of it. And you\u2019re saying some may also be that you are picking up something in her that\u2019s really there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s something she won\u2019t just come out and be like hey man, like I can tell that you\u2019ve been trying to hint or whatever, blah, blah, blah, and I\u2019m sorry but like you know what I mean? [00:08:05.07] Like she won\u2019t do that. So instead it\u2019s either like she\u2019s not engaging, but then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">she does engage. You know what I mean? So it\u2019s like dude, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: If she\u2019s not interested that would be so easy, actually, to communicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: And she\u2019s not doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like and what I resent about that a little bit is that then it makes me feel like I\u2019m in this really vulnerable almost like lap dog position. It\u2019s like dude, I don\u2019t I mean pick a side. Like either I\u2019m not asking you to marry me. I\u2019m not asking professing deep whatever, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">just kind of getting to know you, and also being clear that I do have feelings of wanting to get to know you more, and I do think you\u2019re kind of special. But that\u2019s the normal thing people do when they\u2019re trying to send signals to somebody. [00:09:02.13] But you\u2019ve got to like now I\u2019m starting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">feel like it\u2019s just I don\u2019t like the way that I feel. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Beguiling has in it a kind of manipulative control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, almost like hypnotic kind of thing, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: I mean it is not consciously intentional, but it is intended to [inaudible] people feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. The one thing she did say when I wrote that thing about the armor and all that, she just said, well that\u2019s just how I roll. She\u2019s like I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intentional. Or did she say that\u2019s how I roll and think or I think she said that. I don\u2019t know. She said something like that. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">I was like well, that\u2019s how you roll? That\u2019s kind of a stupid thing to say, first of all. What are you, a fucking hip hop 15 year old kid? [00:10:03.13] The fact that she even said it like that means that she was uncomfortable even in a joking way. I\u2019m making a joke of it. That\u2019s the other thing. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">not even coming on that strong, like I\u2019m trying to make light and I\u2019m trying to I\u2019m not like hey, can you get together today? Okay, how about tomorrow? I\u2019m just trying to like I think I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It also just sounds like she doesn\u2019t know herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a very defensive thing to say, and it might even be what she tells herself. Oh, that\u2019s just the way I am. She doesn\u2019t know [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Oh, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she tells herself because that\u2019s how she carries herself a little bit, is a very tough skinned kind of it\u2019s a I don\u2019t know. Maybe with girls like that they\u2019re so aware of how desirable the minute people see them or are around them, or maybe they just build up this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">thing where it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even know what to do with all this att I mean I want...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well you\u2019re constructing it I might say it the opposite way. [00:11:19.04] So you just say it like she\u2019s so desirable so that leads her to build up this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: When I say desirable she\u2019s probably gotten so much attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yes, but what I\u2019m saying is I think the way she is, is intended to build up that intention that attention. That is part of what builds up the attention. It is that\u2019s what the function it serves. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Yup. It\u2019s like the chicken and the egg thing. But you\u2019re saying it\u2019s more the reason that she gets that kind of attention is because she...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Is because that\u2019s what she [inaudible] psychologically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Puts out a certain kind of energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yes. There are beautiful people who don\u2019t it\u2019s not like that, right? They\u2019re not having people sort of fall at their feet and whatever you say. [00:12:03.00] So it\u2019s something that it\u2019s actually a defense, I would say, keeping people desiring her, but never close. She\u2019s constantly desired, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">constantly desired, constantly rejecting people but never gets close to anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of that I think. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I just feel it makes me sad that like it\u2019s taken up this space in me, you know what I mean? And then it was weird. I felt this other new kind of thing while I was sitting I felt like I mean I\u2019m doing it now. I just felt I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">sleepy and groggy, and I was like on the one hand I feel super unattractive, but I don\u2019t. So that\u2019s a new thing. Like I don\u2019t feel the way I used to feel before, like well I\u2019m just so fucking unattractive and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t like me. [00:13:02.14] But maybe I feel unattractive internally or something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">you know what I mean? Like I just feel kind of yucky or I can\u2019t describe it. It\u2019s almost like an existential ugliness or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Or it\u2019s a feeling [inaudible] that actually has nothing to do with how you appear physically that descends in this kind of way that messes with this kind of woman when this happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s the feelings you had as a boy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s and again it\u2019s I can stop myself from like dude but yeah, she\u2019s the kind of girl you want validation from. But a) you\u2019ve gotten that validation before. Yeah, even if it didn\u2019t work out with Samantha, the fact that I did get her. I mean if it\u2019s just about that, you know what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">mean? Like she can\u2019t you can\u2019t take that you can\u2019t like I\u2019m not crazy enough to feel like oh, she was never really attracted to me. [00:14:05.21] That was just some kind of you know what I mean? Obviously you know what I mean? It\u2019s like that\u2019s what kind of makes me sad in a way. I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">wait a minute, Michelle, Samantha, I did have whatever that checklist was; I\u2019ve had that a number of times. I\u2019m actually quite lucky. If it\u2019s just about validating my ego or validating some childhood thing or whatever. But that\u2019s what\u2019s sad about it, and so hurtful, is that it\u2019s not going to matter. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200593\">Yeah, she could call me tomorrow, tell me to come over, and suddenly we can have a deeper friendship and start dating or something. It\u2019s this is still sad what\u2019s happening. You know what I mean? (pause) And that\u2019s yeah, I don\u2019t know, today just it\u2019s like an avalanche of just feeling melancholy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200594\">[00:15:01.19] Because it\u2019s just like wow, I\u2019ve done I\u2019ve gotten so much better, and I know I\u2019m still fine. Today even I\u2019m fine. I know I am. But man, that just pisses me off. And also I feel angry. I feel like what the fuck am I like all the things I have to offer, all the talents I have, all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200595\">this is how I feel right now? About what? Some broad who probably has lots of issues. She has a fucking kid. She likes to drink a little bit. I mean who knows what\u2019s going on there if you scratch you know what I mean? She\u2019s not fucking perfect at all. So what\u2019s going on here? That\u2019s really it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200596\">my fucking mom. It\u2019s all that shit. And that\u2019s just it\u2019s maddening because wow, I\u2019m still as better as I feel, this is just you know what I mean? [00:16:01.19]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s deep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so deep that it\u2019s still stopping me, I think, from attracting the people I really should be attracting.

Instead of meandering, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">fucking just schlepping around the fucking city, this context is making me a little unable to concentrate. It\u2019s making me dwell on this bullshit. It\u2019s making me not be quite the person I know. I\u2019m getting there. I know I\u2019m getting there, and I will get there, but it\u2019s maddening. It\u2019s like wow, mother <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">fucker. It\u2019s like climbing Everest without an oxygen mask.

It\u2019s an incredible obstruction to like creativity, to being to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">finding yourself, following yourself. If that\u2019s not there...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: I mean in some ways the reason I\u2019m so I\u2019m not even sad because of today. I think I\u2019m just because I\u2019m doing so much better and I have all this perspective and just the weather and everything. It\u2019s like a fucking Camu [ph] novel. I\u2019m just it\u2019s like this existential fucking shit storm of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">wow, wow. Are you kidding me? Because I already know, like even when I came in here, before I came in here, it\u2019s like I\u2019m going to be I think in an hour I\u2019m going to be fine. [00:18:03.20] Like I know things are completely different but the fact that even for an hour I could feel this way and then realize <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">that wow, this is years and years of yeah, feeling unlovable, feeling like I\u2019ve wasted a lot of time trying to be lovable to the wrong people. It\u2019s just like wow. I mean it\u2019s and you can\u2019t get that back. It\u2019s the time\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know man, it\u2019s a bit maddening. It\u2019s maddening. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s one of the most difficult [inaudible] but as you or anyone comes into knowing all there is to know you wish you knew before it\u2019s really sad and really maddening. [00:19:27.27] I mean it brings more feeling. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s just to feel better. There\u2019s so much feeling that you\u2019re starting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">to know you know. (pause) Or [inaudible] how much more there is to still know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: One thing that I\u2019m and I\u2019m not trying to do what I normally do and say something positive now no, because I was just thinking of something very specific. [00:20:15.03] Like one thing that I\u2019ve noticed about myself, though, that I really like is like remember that chick Valerie I was dating <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">for a while, kind of slightly looney tunes. Not really but she just talks a lot. But we started hanging out again recently. Not in a romantic way, but I did find myself going back to that flirty, like just going to sex kind of. And you know what? One day I stopped myself and I texted her. I was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200652\">you know what? I owe you a fucking huge apology. I was like you know what? That\u2019s not cool what I was doing because I know the feelings you had and I\u2019m just sending you like these weird signals, mixed signals, and I was like I\u2019m really sorry about that. That\u2019s not cool. And so I was just thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200653\">that with Allison, too, that you know what? I think maybe not today but I\u2019m probably just going to be like hey man you know what? I think I owe you a big apology. [00:21:06.18] Even though she probably has no fucking clue. But it feels good to me to just be honest with someone, like hey, you know what? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200654\">I was kind of having a shitty day, and I think I was kind of trying to reach out to you, and I kind of shouldn\u2019t have done that. It\u2019s not a big deal but just to something feels good about owning up to am I wrong? Does that sound weird? Something feels very good about owning up. Because that way <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200655\">I don\u2019t even give a shit if she doesn\u2019t respond. It almost lets her know that like if she does think this in any way, which she probably doesn\u2019t, but it does just let her know that hey, like I\u2019m not I wasn\u2019t just being like some kind of lap dog or just trying to get your attention or whatever the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200656\">fuck you thought. I\u2019m an adult, and I was having a shitty day, and I just kind of reached out to you. Or kind of reached out to you. But don\u2019t worry about it. Like it\u2019s not that wasn\u2019t cool. [00:22:04.05] Or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: With Allison, what are you referring to was part of having a shitty day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s been a shitty day. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: In other words, was it feeling like you were down in the dumps and that\u2019s why you were reaching out, or trying to sort of see what [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Well I mean oh, you\u2019re saying was it a shitty day because of my...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Is it sort of is that actually what the explanation is? That\u2019s not what it sounded like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh, you\u2019re saying is the shitty day because I feel like she\u2019s not reciprocating? Well, that\u2019s partially true, but then it\u2019s all the things we\u2019re saying, right? I mean yeah, that\u2019s partially true, but then I think the real sadness I\u2019m feeling is not because of that. It\u2019s because the fact that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">that\u2019s even something like that is can still bother me when it hasn\u2019t bothered me in years quite in this way means that it\u2019s nothing to do with her. [00:23:07.23] That\u2019s a very old shitty thing that I\u2019m experiencing. And now I just want her to yeah, like I wanted her, specifically. I was trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200712\">to kind of get some attention, something from her to appease some of that feeling. Does that make sense? I can\u2019t tell her that, but I can just let her know that hey, you know what? I probably won\u2019t, but I\u2019m saying lately I have been very cognizant of that. It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Even, Arto, something as honest as I can tell you\u2019re not quite here to be interested in this is not being a lap dog. And then dropping it. Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: Wait, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: The being aware that this is the way she\u2019s going to play it out, and probably not just with you; this is probably what she does, right. [00:24:08.17] And not being interested in that is its own kind of finding your own mind separate from that engagement with her. However, I\u2019m not talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">about how you communicated to her or not. Regardless of what you say. I mean I think that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: That\u2019s part of what I\u2019m saying, yeah, is that don\u2019t I\u2019m not sitting around pining over you, if that\u2019s the or sitting around just trying to even though technically that was a little bit of what I was doing. But what I\u2019m saying, though, is that really she could\u2019ve been anybody. She could <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">be Samantha, she could be it\u2019s the deeper what\u2019s happening today is just a deeper like an existential Summer Camp [ph] short story. That\u2019s all it is. And it\u2019s about something way childhood. It has nothing to do with her. [00:25:03.00] So yeah, that\u2019s my way of saying I don\u2019t want to come out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200792\">and say, hey, I\u2019m trying to be interested you\u2019re not interested, but it is saying like hey, like settle down. Like if you\u2019re if there is something she\u2019s thinking that she feels like whoa, what\u2019s going on here, say hey, like I\u2019m a big boy. It\u2019s just been a kind of shitty day for different reasons. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200793\">So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even do that because I think that\u2019s predicated on the idea that maybe she...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s thinking that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: That she\u2019s thinking anything. You know what I mean? So it\u2019s just going to be like what? So I think it\u2019s best to just do fucking nothing. But that\u2019s something maybe I could tell her in person or whatever, if we have a real conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s also something it sounds like you\u2019re telling yourself, too. [00:26:00.15] Like just kind of putting this in a different context in a way. You know when you brought in here yesterday and the day before some there\u2019s this feeling that\u2019s starting that you know, and it was kind of an uh <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">oh. So I think you knew it\u2019s so different than other times. As much as there\u2019s something that\u2019s really sad about realizing how much you can still get into these feelings, you knew it. You saw it coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: No, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. What\u2019s sad about it isn\u2019t even that. What\u2019s sad is the awareness of that and the fucking previous 40 year shit show that came before it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: Even when analysis ends for people, for example, it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t ever get triggered by old stuff. That would be lovely but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">CLIENT: Well I know; that\u2019s part of the sadness, yeah. That\u2019s what I was partly thinking. Wow, like it\u2019s well it\u2019s like anxiety attacks, right? Thank God I haven\u2019t had a full blown panic anxiety attack in years, years. [00:27:04.17] It\u2019s unbelievable. But the reason I think I haven\u2019t is because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">finally, like on a gut level, started working on myself or coming here or all the different things I did to realize that it\u2019s I mean first of all it could happen again, someday; it\u2019s a management thing. It\u2019s not like I had a splinter and I took it out. You know what I mean? So this is a little different, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200852\">though, because this is it\u2019s so emotional, like it\u2019s much more you know what I mean? Panic attacks and anxiety attacks are so arbitrary and maybe a little more biological or something. I don\u2019t know what I mean obviously we have to deal with all these things as well, but they\u2019re just so much more <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200853\">like concrete in a way. Like I\u2019m having an anxiety attack now. My goal is to not have an anxiety attack or whatever. [00:28:01.04] This is such a much more, like I said, like an existential just you know what I mean? That that\u2019s and that in and of itself is sad. That well, no matter what happens, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200854\">this will be part of me. And some days it\u2019ll get triggered. You can have a whole relapse for a month or two. I don\u2019t know. Whatever. I think there\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I\u2019d hope against.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: What.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: A month or two. Like that\u2019s what I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t happen, I\u2019m just saying that yeah, you can have a little bump in the road where for a little while you\u2019re just more whatever than usual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: The aim, though, is that eventually I mean I think when people leave this process it\u2019s when you know so much about what\u2019s happening that as you get triggered you can totally work it through and say, oh, that\u2019s right, this my mother and get yourself there without even having to come here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: Which has gotten way better, yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s pretty impressive. [00:29:00.10] I mean that\u2019s kind of what happened today. It didn\u2019t stop me from doing anything, or it didn\u2019t stop me from actually a better example might even be yesterday, because yesterday, again she texted me and whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">We were just chatting, whatever, and again I said something ha, ha, ha, okay, she was stressed or I don\u2019t know what was going on. And just then I was driving over Route 2, over a little bridge, and it just looked fucking beautiful. So I literally just pulled over. It was half I wanted that picture. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200912\">I was like oh, I\u2019ll send this to her. And I took a it was beautiful. I love lately I\u2019ve been really enjoying taking like photographs. But and I sent it to her. And she was like wow, that\u2019s fucking splendid. Now if this was me at a different point, that wouldn\u2019t have ended there. I\u2019d be like why <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200913\">isn\u2019t she saying thank you. Why isn\u2019t she this is fucking splendid. [00:30:01.06] What you know what I mean? Like I would\u2019ve looked for more from her. And I just didn\u2019t. So and I think today I think maybe she just caught me off guard by getting in touch so early in the morning and just kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200914\">of see this is what this is the part that I have to be vigilant about. That\u2019s what happens. You have feelings for someone, the minute you hear from them it can trigger you know what I mean? Because you want so when you hear from them you\u2019re like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re also thinking about her in perspective of trying not to get ahead of yourself. There\u2019s still the basic level of what if you are attracted to someone who is unavailable, and you know psychically you\u2019re picking up right away [ph]. It\u2019s always going to be someone unavailable. There is <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200931\">going to be this game and that that\u2019s part of what\u2019s so exciting. [00:31:01.14] I use that broadly, part of what is drawing you in. That I think is all more of what there is to continue to get to understand of this why beguiling is so attractive, rather than just someone who straightforwardly loves <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200932\">you. Someone who will respond and then when you express yourself want to reciprocate, not want to be gamey about it but just be there.

[00:33:13.27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">CLIENT: To who? I don\u2019t think so. I mean what do you mean? In general you mean? When she was younger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I mean I\u2019m saying that loosely, like towards you as a mother, with your father?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">CLIENT: Not beguiling. I mean beguiling I think of as slightly kind of sexual, romantic. Unavailable maybe, yeah. I mean a different kind of unavailable but smothering, which is the opposite of beguiling. It\u2019s like either unavailable or I don\u2019t know if my mom was unavailable. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A51\">the right word for my mom. I don\u2019t think she was unavailable. Just smothering and critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">THERAPIST: But always there. [00:34:03.09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean yeah. I mean even like in North Carolina when she wasn\u2019t she\u2019d work weekends, whatever. I never I don\u2019t think that contributes to any of this, you know what I mean? Because she was there the other days. I mean her schedule was just but my mom was around, you know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A91\">It but it was like well it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re around if it\u2019s if you just don\u2019t feel that deep unconditional connection. (pause) And also gruff, I would say. She\u2019s definitely more like my grandfather, like just sometimes a little bit blunt, like especially if her feathers are ruffled. She\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A92\">just fucking say shit kind of. And I\u2019ve told you before, it\u2019s a little bit yeah, it\u2019s like a little bit gruff, I think is a good word. [00:35:00.20] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Just one example from your current adult life, where you showed her a picture and she says so beautiful and then [inaudible]. I mean there\u2019s something that is a kind of I\u2019m available with loving affection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s everything\u2019s conditional, though, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: But a second later it\u2019s snapped away, with humiliation. There\u2019s a pull you in and rejecting you. That\u2019s one example I know, but if that that probably happened even in microscopic ways all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">CLIENT: Of course, of course. I mean yeah, that\u2019s a yeah, and especially I think unfortunately if you\u2019re a sensitive kid that remembers all those things and so she probably thought I wasn\u2019t even paying attention or something but so stuff not only that she said to me but that I would overhear the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B11\">adults talk. [00:36:16.07] I mean that\u2019s a I got a Library of Congress of fucking examples.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You do? Because you said of course..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B5\">CLIENT: Well because they\u2019re all really the same example. The example is these undercutting, saying something without really saying it. Oh, Claire\u2019s [ph] son is so handsome. Have you seen Claire\u2019s [ph] son? Oh, such a sweet, loves his mother, so whatever. All these well like so what are you trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B51\">to say? I mean why are you going on and on about that. So things like that. Things even that aren\u2019t didn\u2019t have to do with me, by the way. [00:37:01.02] So and so family that they oh, they bought a beautiful house. It\u2019s oh, you walk in, there\u2019s a huge lobby. So yeah, that has nothing to do with <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B52\">me, but it\u2019s like so you\u2019re trying to say Dad\u2019s not providing enough for you, or we\u2019re not as good as other people, or you\u2019re trying to say something. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not [inaudible] conscious communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200B9\">CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly. Because I don\u2019t give a fuck or none of these people give a fuck what their house is like. I mean maybe they do but if they do, then they\u2019re just probably your fucking sister or something. You\u2019re a little family yeah. No one gives a shit. There are lots of nice houses in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B91\">world. I mean so what. So there was a lot of that, a lot of these not just related to me, but things that would just still hurt me or piss me off or make me feel protective about my dad. Or even my mom, make me protective. That\u2019s with the life coaching thing. [00:38:00.16] I\u2019d be like dude, do you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B92\">you\u2019re a worthless piece of shit or something? Do you live in a hovel? Like there have been times when I was younger that I would tell them that. You keep all these comparisons, like this person has this, this person did that. I mean what are you, like peasants living out in the caves or something? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200B93\">Like you know what I mean? Just it would even make me upset for her. You know what I mean? As my mom. That\u2019s like stop like this weird kind of disrespecting yourself. It\u2019s kind of like lame and kind of just I don\u2019t know what the word is, but it\u2019s like petty bullshit observations, like (pause) So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s also at times, though, more than petty, to say in the way you\u2019re describing, that tone, when you know there\u2019s a message meant for you somewhere inside. [00:39:09.16] Your son\u2019s so handsome. It\u2019s cruel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Sadistic, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yup, it is. I mean but those they can still be petty too. By petty I just mean it\u2019s just so it\u2019s nonsense. Like my mind doesn\u2019t it so doesn\u2019t work that way. I just don\u2019t get that. Of course I can see if someone has some dude\u2019s handsome, some woman\u2019s beautiful. But I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C11\">if I\u2019m at a bar and there\u2019s some beguiling girl and her ugly friend, if I go to talk to the beguiling girl I\u2019m not going to be a douche to the ugly friend, you know what I mean? Like I\u2019m they\u2019re people. [00:40:00.20] You know what I mean? I might be attracted to this one but I won\u2019t say anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C12\">or behave in a way that\u2019s you know what I\u2019m saying? Like that\u2019s just like what the fuck. Like yeah, I kind of get it, this one\u2019s beautiful; this one not so much. In my opinion. But so what. Like let\u2019s not that\u2019s not something it\u2019s like tactless and just and cruel and yeah, it\u2019s a...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I get that, what you\u2019re saying, on a sort of principle level. It\u2019s petty, and for you that\u2019s so petty, that level of disputing. I think I\u2019m trying to say that there is something that feels sadistic towards you, that is coming out at you, at times, is sadism, Arto. It\u2019s actually intended to <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200C31\">wound. It\u2019s not just carelessness. It\u2019s actual intended to be hurtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s like my grandfather. [00:41:01.01] Yeah, he was like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure she would not own that if you asked her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C9\">CLIENT: Are you kidding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s unconsciously sadism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CD\">CLIENT: Which means what, that she\u2019s just acting out her own fuckedupness or what her grandfather did to what my grandfather...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Probably what was done to her, but there\u2019s a it\u2019s a it\u2019s different than I said this thing and oops it hurt you because I wasn\u2019t thinking about your mind. It\u2019s there\u2019s something that feels intentionally, unconsciously, intentionally hurtful. It is cruel. So that and this is what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF1\">think is feeling like what\u2019s happening with Allison. There\u2019s something in her, this game that she plays a little bit, even if she\u2019s not thinking about it that much now, but you\u2019re picking up on something in her that I think she probably does do, even if it gets bigger at times, and this is just subtle, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF2\">that is pull in, reject, pull in, reject. And the rejection, there is an excitement in the oh, I didn\u2019t mean that. [00:42:02.01] You took me the wrong way. You\u2019re getting the wrong signal. There\u2019s some excitement in being cruel, in keeping the person down, keeping the person feeling like a lap dog. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF3\">There\u2019s an investment in relating in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. But in my yeah, but who knows what her like how that has happened for her, why my mom I mean, why? I don\u2019t know. It could be her she had a miscarriage. Maybe that\u2019s she had a lot of anger about it and she took it out on me. I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] immediately said that\u2019s her dad too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, my grandfather was pretty rough. I mean he could be both incredibly sweet and then just say some like kind of harsh things. [00:43:05.26] Yeah, hurtful things. And of all of them, my mom is the most like my grandfather. Super sharp, like super, super sharp, which I\u2019m glad about. I\u2019d rather <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200D51\">in some ways I\u2019d rather, now that I see what\u2019s going on with my grandmother, in some ways I\u2019d rather have my mom. I mean just at least have her fucking mental faculties. But again, if her feathers get ruffled, if she\u2019s feeling in one of those woe is me moods or whatever, like that, she can kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200D52\">snap, like be snippy and say hurtful shit. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a dumbed down way of saying it, but if her own father was cruel to her she could also feel like she\u2019s not lovable to men. [00:44:02.08] Men are mean to her and she\u2019s nothing to them. She hates them. She then develops a relationship to men, including her own son, of hateful feelings. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200D71\">The same feelings she had for her father could come out at you just because you\u2019re a man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D9\">CLIENT: Right, right. Yeah, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DB\">THERAPIST: You then developed those same feelings that she had about her father towards your mother. You heard me joking it wouldn\u2019t and you looked at me like I had three heads, don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, but there may be some if you\u2019ve been treated that way there\u2019s hatred that comes with <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200DB1\">it. When it\u2019s bad enough there\u2019s so much hatred that sometimes it\u2019s better to be the person putting people down than the one put down. It\u2019s better to be the one in control and manipulating. You might\u2019ve had someone be on your lap as a lapdog.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561714\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200DD\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s what happened with all the I mean that\u2019s the majority. There\u2019s only been three or four beguiling ones, all these other women I\u2019ve dated are that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Which is the safer role to be in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that\u2019s a good point. [00:45:04.07] I mean I think that\u2019s worth it\u2019s good to think about that because it helps to it\u2019s perspective. It deflates things and calms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200E3\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s just so much more with this with her than the it feels like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, because the story I mean that\u2019s the whole story. I mean that\u2019s why I wanted to write about these things, right. I mean her stories are ridiculous. I mean so I can only imagine maybe the anger or the things she\u2019s felt towards her dad. Because he dumped a lot of things on her. And on top <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200E51\">of that, she didn\u2019t get anything in return. She wasn\u2019t the favorite. My aunt who passed away yeah, my aunt who passed away and my uncle were. The looney tune in Providence and my mom were not the favorites. So there\u2019s that, too. [00:46:02.00] It\u2019s like she did all these things for her Dad and was <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200E52\">the one who got dumped on with all his neurosis and political things and trying to get out of Asia. Just a lot of shit. When she was like 16, 17. Things that no kid should be going through. So probably it fucks you up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200E7\">THERAPIST: She got shit [ph] on too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.
