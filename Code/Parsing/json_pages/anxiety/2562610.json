Come on in. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Are you uncomfortable with me sitting in this chair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: No. I\u2019m fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Okay. I am uncomfortable with it which is why I\u2019m doing it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah? What made you decide to? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) That\u2019s a question I\u2019m not sure I can answer. But I can give you the reasons that I\u2019m uncomfortable with it. It\u2019s about a foot closer to you. There\u2019s no stool between the chairs. (PAUSE) I guess I\u2019m... (PAUSE) I asked if you were uncomfortable with it because I\u2019m also uncomfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">with the idea that you might be uncomfortable with it because I\u2019m moving closer to you. So I think I worry that that might feel threatening or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Threatening how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Uh... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I\u2019m not sure. Not sure. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(PAUSE) I\u2019m going to move on because I think we\u2019ll get back to the same subject later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t know really how to answer it. So, you know, sitting here and staring at a question is probably not going to get us somewhere. So... Have you been married before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. Have you been pregnant before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m happy to explore the questions but I\u2019m curious about how many... There\u2019s more now than... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:03:09)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. Not only that there\u2019s a lot but that it\u2019s a pretty shift. And so clearly there\u2019s something on your mind that you\u2019re thinking about and working, trying to work out. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: You mean, it\u2019s a big shift from me not asking questions to asking questions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Okay. (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) Um... (PAUSE) So I am and have been for most of the time that I\u2019ve been seeing you very curious about you and I guess I... I don\u2019t... I have a hard time saying whether I\u2019m more curious now than I have been before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">But I also have been protecting you from that curiosity, perhaps protecting myself from... (PAUSE) ...the negative feelings associated with... (PAUSE) ...stepping past your comfort zone and also rejections. You know, maybe you don\u2019t want to tell me anything about you. But I want to know. That might <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">hurt. That\u2019s one thing and then... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">Maybe you\u2019re okay telling me some things but I ask something that, you know, reaches too deep or hurts to think about or something like that. (PAUSE) I don\u2019t want to hurt you. So those are sort of the reasons that I haven\u2019t asked questions, I think. So I feel like... (SIGH) (PAUSE) Or some of the reasons. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">I expect there are more. (PAUSE) I feel like those are artificial barriers. They\u2019re ones I\u2019ve constructed. They\u2019re not ones you have. So, they\u2019re, in a sense, barriers that I\u2019ve constructed to intimacy with you. And I\u2019m trying to lower them and also trust you to tell me what your boundaries are instead <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200352\">of drawing some other line to avoid finding them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on. But that\u2019s a part of it. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m wondering also if my pregnancy is also sort of further stimulating your curiosity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE) It is another thing to be curious about. (PAUSE) But I... (PAUSE) Yeah. I\u2019m not sure. My feeling is that it\u2019s more coincidental timewise because about the same time I found out that, that you told me that you were pregnant, we were talking about my feelings for you and so it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">sort of all like... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562610\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I think it\u2019s coincidental. It just happens to be a thing about which I am curious. Clearly, it\u2019s a part of your life. And I sort of have a sense that, you know, your life is changing and is going to continue to change. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well... It\u2019s so... In theory, I live somewhere, right. My pregnancy is so conspicuous and it\u2019s not a theory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. But also like you live somewhere but your house is very personal and not that personal at the same time in some ways. But maybe that is just a feature of the conspicuousness. I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">You know, the question I asked you is very personal and where you live is a different kind of personal. So... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: And knowing these things about me, is there sort of a feeling that that way you\u2019ll feel closer to me? What are your thoughts about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: And is that... I mean, there, it\u2019s more nuanced to it than this. But is that the goal, in a sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: (SIGH) It\u2019s a goal. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s the only goal because it\u2019s also like the practice of doing it seems to be an important thing. So that\u2019s a goal. But there\u2019s also just like I am curious. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m curious. I just am curious. So does that make sense at all? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I think though the question for us to think about as so why... I mean, not that why puts it as if there\u2019s something wrong with it. I don\u2019t mean why in a bad sense. But just like what does it mean why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Because it means a lot clearly. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) So I... (PAUSE) Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m more or less always curious like about almost everything. So it\u2019s like... (PAUSE) I\u2019m not sure if you mean to be asking the question \u201cwhy is that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Okay. And I really don\u2019t know about that. I feel like you\u2019re asking the more specific question of why am I curious about you or these particular things is important which I think is a very reasonable question. But I sort of can\u2019t separate from the other one of like why am I generally <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">curious. I like to know things. I... (PAUSE) I think usually, \u201cI find it interesting,\u201d is a sufficient answer for, \u201cwhy are you curious about that thing.\u201d I realize that\u2019s not the case here. It seems like there are other important things too. But... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">In a professional context, this question comes up like, \u201cWhy do you want to study that thing?\u201d And that\u2019s a hard question to answer for a lot of different reasons in part because the people that have the funding to allow you to study things don\u2019t have the same motivations that most people studying them <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">have. Like I have the sense that at least some people, my advisors, some of my friends do academic work just because we\u2019re curious about things. We want to know how the world works and how these particular things work. What can you do? That\u2019s not necessarily the purpose of funding. It\u2019s a purpose that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">comes and goes in public funding depending on... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">(PAUSE) But, at the end of the day, it comes down to I want to solve specific problems but I also just want to know things. I get interested in a specific problem and then want to understand it and solve it. I don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re a problem that I need to solve. But I\u2019m curious about you and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">who you are and why you are who you are and... (PAUSE) But that\u2019s always the case for people that I care about. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562610\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(PAUSE) You know, on the level of simple curiosity, is it hard to date as a couples counselor? I would imagine that would be difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: So... (LAUGHTER) Tanya (ph) has a few friends who are women and priests. They find it difficult to date because most men that they meet... (PAUSE) ...sort of response in one of two ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">One of which is how they want to tell them everything about their personal spiritual journey immediately as if this is a person to lean on not a relationship to form or they sort of like, \u201cWhoa. Okay,\u201d and leave. So it\u2019s... I imagine it could be similar not that your experience has to match. But so... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">(PAUSE) I feel like it... (PAUSE) I mean, do you feel like I have not expressed curiosity about you before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Okay. I feel like I have been saying that I\u2019m curious about you for a long time and not asking questions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I guess I\u2019m asking whether that has actually coming across. That would have been something I thought I was saying but wasn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: No. But it\u2019s more obvious in your asking and the questions that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Sure. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And I guess I asked about the pregnancy piece because many of the questions that you\u2019re asking is around pregnancy and my relationship and so forth. So the curiosity seems to revolve around that in particular. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think it\u2019s generally true that I\u2019m very curious about your relationships. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">(PAUSE) Yeah, the other question that I have is what does your husband do? What is his occupation? (PAUSE) Yeah. I don\u2019t... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t have a clear sense of why that is. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">(PAUSE) I think it\u2019s because I have a sense that they\u2019re important in some way. (PAUSE) You know, I asked if you were happy or content some time ago. That was an important question to me. But I feel like you have sort of suggested loosely that you take care of yourself in a lot of ways and you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">a lot of relationships and that is one of the ways that you take care of yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">That may be me reading into what you said. But that is the sort of general sense that I got that is you have a sort of support network of some kind. Between that and some sort of internal strength that you have, you are able to do the work that you do. (PAUSE) I\u2019m also reminded of one of the professors <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">on my committee who likes to find aphorisms and one of the things that he likes to point out is that humans are more sensitive to change than they are to things that stay the same. So this is a thing that\u2019s changing. We see motion better than we see static objects. So this is, you know... Maybe that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200792\">comes back to conspicuous in some sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">But also like this is clearly a thing that\u2019s changing in your life and life is changing in pretty good ways. So that like raises my \u201cOh Change\u201d alerts or something. Then clearly I have questions like, \u201cHow much is this a change?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of change is this?\u201d (PAUSE) I can stop asking questions if <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">you want me to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562610\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Where did that come from? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Me. (LAUGHTER) You know, you\u2019re asking why I\u2019m asking questions. One possibility is that you\u2019re uncomfortable with me asking questions. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: No. I want to understand where it\u2019s coming from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not feeling uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019m feeling that this is extremely important to you and we\u2019re here to understand what\u2019s important to you for sure. And it seems like there\u2019s kind of some anxiety around it too. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s hard. Every time I ask you a question, I tell you something about myself, about what I\u2019m curious about, about the things that matter to me in some way. I tell you how much you matter to me and... (PAUSE) Yeah. I think I am deeply afraid of disappointment or loss. Neither of those <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">capture the right sentiment. So, yeah, there\u2019s a sense of... I\u2019m also afraid of hurting other people. I don\u2019t like to do that and so there\u2019s sort of... There\u2019s anxiety around that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well, as a result of being pregnant, I\u2019m going to be away for some period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Actually, that... (SIGH) (LAUGHTER) I\u2019m okay with that, I think. So Tanya asked me a couple weeks ago. I told her that I was going to see you more frequently because you were going to be gone for a while or the payment we had worked out because you were going to be gone for a while. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">said, \u201cSo, are you going to be okay?\u201d (LAUGHTER) Chad (ph) is out of town or on vacation this week. She was apprehensive about that at the time. So she was drawing on her own experience and suggesting that that would be a very hard things for me. I don\u2019t have the sense that that\u2019s true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">I think if you were to disappear for six weeks without me knowing where you were, that would be really hard. But... (PAUSE) I sort of... In some sense, you know... (PAUSE) Childbirth is dangerous but in the modern day is not that dangerous compared to historically. (PAUSE) So you\u2019ll probably be fine <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">barring those complications. I have complete certainty in some sense. I know what you\u2019re doing. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">(PAUSE) Yeah. I really don\u2019t like uncertainty, I think. (PAUSE) You know, you\u2019ll go away. You\u2019ll come back. Assuming I\u2019m still in Denver... I hope I am because I like talking to you. You\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll resume. It\u2019ll be hard at first probably. That seems to be the pattern. But then it will be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">okay. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: But it does seem like, in addition to the curiosity, there\u2019s something that you\u2019re sort of struggling or grappling with. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: (SIGH) (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m very curious... I\u2019m curious about you choosing to sit in a chair that makes you feel uncomfortable. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: So my initial thought is, you know, I don\u2019t come here because I want to be in pain forever since I come here for exactly the opposite reason. I have the sense that like there are things in my life both that are causing me pain and there are things in the past that have caused a great deal of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">pain... (PAUSE) But I also get the sense sometimes that there are particular things that I do or find uncomfortable that... (PAUSE) ...I just need to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562610\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">There\u2019s actually... Sitting in this chair is actually not that different from sitting in that chair. The view is a little bit different. It sort of impacts things a little bit. I\u2019m actually about a foot closer and there\u2019s no stool. I don\u2019t have anything that I\u2019m hiding behind. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">(PAUSE) But I think, in a general sense, I am exploring my fear. I think that\u2019s my macro view of why I\u2019m sitting in this chair today... (PAUSE) ...which is definitely something I\u2019ve been doing for a while, largely as a result of interacting with you. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">(PAUSE) We spent the end of the session last time talking about what am I afraid of and I could not tell you what I was afraid of. And so you sort of closed the session suggesting that it was uniquely difficult for me to deal with disappointment or find life again afterwards which is both very true <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">and I found very frustrating. I feel like I expressed briefly some of my frustration. (LAUGHTER) We know this. We\u2019ve knowing this for a while. (PAUSE) That does not... That doesn\u2019t point a way forward which is hilarious as a life microscopic repetition of the macroscopic problem which is I feel frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">in response to that and sort of, \u201cHow do we go forward.\u201d But that is exactly the question that you were suggesting I have that... (PAUSE) So... Anyway, so the... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">I had some frustration and despair to work through when I left. (PAUSE) Which was a really interesting process. (PAUSE) You know, you might remember the time early on that you were sort of asking questions about my mother and I said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m done here.\u201d I didn\u2019t have the same sense of like, \u201cI should <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">just stop.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">You know, I sort of had an overriding sense that while it was disappointing this time to end on that particular note, to feel like I don\u2019t have an answer to this question, and, in some sense, we hadn\u2019t covered any ground. Like we were back at the same point of... (PAUSE) Yes. Despair is a thing I struggle <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">with. I would hope that we would cover more ground than that. I\u2019m expressing my feelings at the time not telling you what I actually think. I think we have covered a lot of ground. (PAUSE) (SIGH) (PAUSE) But, in this particular case, it was very clear to me what the solution was. The solution was to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">come back today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">The way forward was clear and I had no disinclination to take the way forward. Just was frustrating to be where I was. (PAUSE) I can\u2019t remember exactly the path of thoughts that led to the end of that... But the end of that was a realization that I\u2019ve already given you today which is I deeply fear disappointment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">I think it was sort of like you had asked, \u201cWhat are you afraid of,\u201d maybe not those words, \u201cSo we can figure out whether it\u2019s real or not.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">You know, it\u2019s very real. I have been deeply disappointed, for lack of a better word...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Oh, I wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cLet\u2019s figure out what you\u2019re afraid of so we can figure out whether it\u2019s real or not.\u201d That would not be the second half of that sentence for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I felt the need to interrupt you there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m glad you did. It\u2019s very interesting that you would say that. You definitely, in association with fears, suggested that they may or may not be real or the thing in which I\u2019m afraid may or may not be real in the context of why am I afraid of intimacy with Tanya. At least that\u2019s how I heard it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562610\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess... I don\u2019t... That\u2019s just not how I frame things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re real because... I mean, what\u2019s a real fear versus not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So I... The goal, in my mind, the goal of exploring the fear is not to find whether it\u2019s real or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... (PAUSE) I feel like I\u2019ve mangled what you\u2019ve said now. But I... (PAUSE) But I do feel like you suggested that the... (PAUSE) ...not the fear but the thing of which I am afraid may not be real. (PAUSE) Which seem like different things to me. They may not be different things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019m not following. Let me try to follow along.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Okay. Fear is a feeling. But it\u2019s a feeling about a thing, about an event that may or may not happen. And it might not be possible for that thing to happen. And, in that sense, the thing that one might be afraid might be unreal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But all events could possibly happen. I mean, you could be afraid of the end of the world and that\u2019s a possibility too. (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: So, you know, being who I am, this is a case where I\u2019m actually... I would say, \u201cWell, what do the data say? What does the transcript say that you said that I heard different from what you said?\u201d That\u2019s... Not that we actually need to do that but that\u2019s how I function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You heard me very differently, it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Clearly I heard you very differently than whatever you meant to be said. Now I\u2019m sort of curious about what you meant to be saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">(PAUSE) At any rate... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) The realization that I had that I felt like was really important was that I was afraid of disappointment or loss. These are things that really hurt. They have hurt in the past. I\u2019m afraid of them happening again. This is particularly true in the case of Tanya. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">I\u2019m afraid of putting my trust in her again. I really opened myself up to her and relied on her and then she went away. That really hurts. (PAUSE) And so I guess I... I don\u2019t know if I told you. But she\u2019s been doing better recently. Like she\u2019s been really well for the last three weeks or month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">Which has been really nice. It\u2019s actually been... I have been able to enjoy her being herself in some sense. But I know it\u2019s going to go away. And you might quip that I don\u2019t know that. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to go away. I could be wrong. But I\u2019m still certain about it. That\u2019s not a common feature <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">about me. Usually I remain agnostic about the things I can\u2019t know or I try to. You know, I form theories and hypotheses and there\u2019s a different category than knowing. But I feel like I know that she\u2019s going to get bad again and then she\u2019s going to go away. So why would I start to rely on her again? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D32\">I feel like I\u2019ve tried to express this view repeatedly. But I always feel like I stumble through it or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Well, I was thinking... (PAUSE) This isn\u2019t beside the point but there\u2019s other points besides this. But I was thinking it depends on what you put in the foreground and background. Because even if you\u2019re sure it\u2019ll go away, I would say that you\u2019re similarly sure that it\u2019ll come back again because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">being sure it\u2019ll go away is sort of seeing a cycle which I\u2019m not 100% sure, you know, you\u2019re (inaudible at 00:40:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562610\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if this is an upward trend or cycle. But thinking it\u2019s a cycle certainly seems possible. She\u2019ll come back again. But what\u2019s in the foreground is her going away. Which I don\u2019t mean to be quibbling or focusing on her coming back but it\u2019s just to give a sort of perspective on that take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I appreciate that and think there\u2019s something interesting in that. I\u2019ve been thinking if you ask me what I think of something, I\u2019m more likely to respond with the things I don\u2019t like about it. My guess is you are more likely to respond with the things you do like about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">I think we might eventually (inaudible at 00:41:15) but I think that\u2019s how we both might start. So I think this is an interesting example of that same thing. I am not as sure that she will come back. That is... So, yeah, maybe it\u2019s a cycle. It\u2019s seemed to both of us, Tanya and I, that this has had some <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">features of a hypomanic episode. She suggested it to me but I had been thinking it independently which would sort of suggest diagnostically that it\u2019s bipolar too or something like that. But the problem is that the good phases are intermittent. There is a cycle but the good phases will last and presumably <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD2\">over time, one works toward not existing in either extreme but somewhere that is normal and acceptable. That\u2019s... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">That\u2019s an aspiration rather than something about which I have any certainty. The only thing about which I am certain is that she will get bad again. I\u2019m not certain that she will live. I\u2019m not certain that there will be a good time again. So... (SIGH) (PAUSE) I feel like I should apologize now for having <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">that view. But I\u2019m not going to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Why do you feel like you even should?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: To me? You need to apologize to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: What have you done to me to have that view or that you feel that you need to apologize for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. But I wanted to tell you I had the feeling so we could explore it. I think, in some sense, I\u2019ve rejected the hope that you were extending or the positive vision. So I think I feel bad about that, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">(PAUSE) Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I have no emotional commitment to that view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. (PAUSE) So this fear of loss takes a whole lot of forms. In searching for a job, I\u2019m afraid that... I have a very good advisor now. I\u2019m afraid that I will be in a situation where I have a less good advisor, somebody who is not supportive. And so there\u2019s a loss associated <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">with that. I\u2019m afraid that I will get trapped into something I don\u2019t like or enjoy. That\u2019s not a reason not to do it. But that\u2019s just a thing to be aware of and take into account when I\u2019m selecting my work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">So there\u2019s sort of another place where like the fear is important and it\u2019s saying something but it\u2019s... It\u2019s also trying to say more than it should be allowed to say. So I should pay attention to it but then do what I need to do. So... (PAUSE) Is that sensible? Have I said... Okay. (PAUSE) I mean, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">context of... (PAUSE) ...of Tanya again divorces a safe thing that would be a great loss for me in some ways, surrendering some particular set of my values or piece of my value set. It would also mean, in some sense, like surrendering my remaining faith in Tanya, whatever there is left of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200F2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562610\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">I talked some, I think two weeks ago, about feeling disappointment in myself for thinking about it and telling people about it as a result. So, you know (inaudible at 00:45:25) kindly told me that I was wrong, that other people would not be disappointment in me particularly those who knew what was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">on. So I can confirm that you were correct in that. I knew you were at the time. But it still didn\u2019t feel true. So having had that realization about disappointment, I was able to talk it with some of my close friends. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good. I don\u2019t mean to interrupt. I realize, you\u2019ve...
