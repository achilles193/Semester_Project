Do you want some?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m good thank you. I was thinking about something over the weekend. I\u2019m not sure what reminded me of it. I started writing for real. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Which is really (inaudible at 00:01:04). My mother\u2019s here for another ten days, so I figure if I can get a really decent start during these ten days then I have regularly four hours a day and that will be the thing. So I think it was probably related to something that I was writing or thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">writing. But this was something that has come up, I think, quite often in, you know, my latest peregrinations (sp) for, toward, you know, possible gig, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And, it\u2019s funny, (inaudible at 00:02:09), I\u2019m usually good. It\u2019s like I forget, I forget what I\u2019m doing. I forget the content of what it is that I\u2019m doing, like I lose the thread, in exactly the same way, I think, that I lose the thread in my conversations. In other words, like I can\u2019t feel any expertise, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I can\u2019t feel any familiarity, I can\u2019t feel any sense of, you know, of belonging to, or belonging with whatever it is that I\u2019m doing. And that applied to graduate school, it applied to, you know, the public health work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">You know, ultimately at the end of the day, what would prevent me from settling into one or another situation would be this failure of memory. And sometimes it was specific, like there was, you know, specific knowledge that needed to be produced in a conversation that I didn\u2019t have, and sometimes it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">was more affective, like, you know, needing to have a sense of kind of professional assurance. And it wasn\u2019t like I hadn\u2019t ever been able to produce that knowledge, it was something more baroque than that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But it involves some failure of memory that seemed very analogous to what we\u2019ve been talking of for the last couple of weeks, and I thought I would bring it up. (Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess in that way it\u2019s kind of unconscious way of not letting yourself feel a part of something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s occurred to me. But I don\u2019t quite get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Like why you would do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019, it\u2019s hard for me to access the (inaudible at 00:05:39). I think I told you this anecdote of walking through the library, (inaudible at 00:05:45) , after I had come back from Holland, and it\u2019s just like this brief moment, I was walking up the stair, I have a very vivid recollection of this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">I was walking up the stairs and there were two librarians, I assume, you know, middle-aged, walking down, and they were talking about something that involved everyday routine activities, and I felt uncomfortable. I felt like, \u201cGod, I wouldn\u2019t want that,\u201d or \u201cGod, I\u2019m uncomfortable with that daily routine.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">Like somehow it was something threatening, that routine. And I think I was struck by that almost immediately, like, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s weird. Why would this be such a, such an unpleasant thought to entertain, that this, you know, that it\u2019s boring, that it\u2019s, you know, this kind of hum-drum bourgeois existence, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">is it that I feel more comfortable, you know, as a, as an outsider that passes in the night?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562144\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">I don\u2019t know. I never figured it out, but that moment always struck me in connection to this question I\u2019ve puzzled over quite a bit. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve been acclimatized to be alien, so much so that I can\u2019t even remember the information that I would need to have at my disposal in order to be (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">at 00:07:52). So anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">And then, and there\u2019s something Jennie (sp) said to me last night, it\u2019s a wonderful moment, she said something like, \u201cYou\u2019re so good at this, you know, being a partner and a father, you know, who knew, it\u2019s such a surprise.\u201d I can\u2019t remember whether I said, \u201cIt\u2019s such a surprise,\u201d or whether she said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">\u201cIt\u2019s such a surprise.\u201d But, you know, it just, it was like this revelation that I\u2019m very good at these things. And again, somehow, not again, but somehow, you know, the specific knowledge that\u2019s involved in, you know, being made husband, whatever, being a father, which is considerable. I mean, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">know, it\u2019s affection and care and nurturing and support and all these other things require that you remember things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">You remember many, many things. Those don\u2019t escape me. There\u2019s not an incapacity, but there\u2019s some interference in risk situations and there\u2019s some discomfort at a, you know, at a fundamental level occurs, and can be symbolized. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: (Long pause) Do you think this is out of loyalty to your father in the sense that in your mind, in a way, you want to really be part of things with him, it means not being part of things like the work environment? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: That doesn\u2019t ring a bell. I don\u2019t feel conscious loyalty to my father at this point. Maybe there\u2019s some evolutionary phenomenon, maybe there\u2019s a vestigial character to it, also originally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">I mean, I think it seemed to me plausible in the abstract, I guess, when I thought about this that you know, there\u2019s something about usual, the usual middle-class regularities, regular middle-class life that I was sort of acculturated to reject, and that it\u2019s difficult for me to, you know, to kind of, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">difficult for me to assimilate now, because of that. So I guess that\u2019s a kind of loyalty, if so, if that\u2019s, you know, a plausible explanation, I guess that\u2019s a kind of loyalty to my father, in the sense that, you know, that\u2019s where that particular ideology is coming from on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">I\u2019ve very consciously gone about trying, unsuccessfully as it turned out, for the last few years, to reject that, just in part because, you know, there was just nothing to replace it with so, you know, that\u2019s a crisis, I guess, and in my world view, a significant crisis. But it, I mean, that feels only <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">weirdly, I mean, it doesn\u2019t feel like an emotional investment in my father, it just feels like you know, a cultural phenomenon. In other words, it\u2019s not as if I feel the reason that I have held on to this outmoded, you know, kind of cultural concept is that I had some loyalty to my father on any conscious <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">level. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">It\u2019s more like, well you know, you grow up in an Thailand tribe, and you know, you wear the, you know, get used to wearing the relevant costume and, you know, find relevant morays, and those are the morays that I kind of got used to, and it\u2019s difficult to shift gears. It\u2019s not personal in my imagining <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">of it. Now, you know, these things are complicated so I don\u2019t reject that out of hand. I\u2019m not aware of feeling particular investment in sustaining this bit of my father. He didn\u2019t do so well by it himself, let alone on our behalf. But it was an interesting moment yesterday, actually, when my mother <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">was a couple days ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562144\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">I was visiting with an old friend, family friend, who\u2019d come to hang out with Grayson and she was telling her the story of how my father and his friend Larry came to found the collective, and the story was, as she told it, he went to Jordan in like 1963 and he decided that, to his, you know, disappointment <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">and dismay, this kind of socialist ideal was founded on you know, the exploitation of Arab labor. And so he decided to go to, back to the United States and start a kibbutz like Enterprise that would, you know, create an alternative economy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">And I was talking, you know, with Jennie (sp) as we were going to bed, said to me, \u201cYou know, I heard this and I was really kind of outraged,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, like what kind of a stupid thing is it to respond to, you know, oppression by going back to the United States to, you know, create an alternative <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">to it?\u201d And it was funny to hear her say this because I immediately saw her point, for one thing. But for another thing, I had always taken the, you know, the kind of internal logic of this, you know, their ideology, for granted, like. You know, maybe it wasn\u2019t realistic, whatever, but at least it made <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">sense on its own terms in Jennie\u2019s (sp) life. You know, even on its own terms it was a crazy idea. It was an odd thing to do, anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: I guess part of family mythology that you just\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Of course it made sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">Yeah, of course, this was the thing to do, you know. Larry had been with the United Nations in Thailand, and it was very awful in Thailand, and my father had been in, you know, Jordan, and it had been kind of, he\u2019d been very kind of shocked and disappointed by Jordan, so they both went to the United <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">States and they did something else. And this is an old debate among socialists, anyway. So it\u2019s not, whatever, but it was just, I guess my point was just that it\u2019s not about my relationship with my father, so far as I can see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">Except that it\u2019s obviously, you know, an inexplicable thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And if I, to follow Jennie\u2019s (sp) point, there\u2019s the sort of usual kind of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">Very self-serving logic. The depression is terrible. I can\u2019t believe these, you know, (inaudible at 00:19:34), or whatever he saw, I don\u2019t know. And (inaudible at 00:19:47) response was to go halfway around the world and do something the way he wanted to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">(Long pause continues) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: What are you chewing on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking about the first thing you said again in light of what you just said, something about you losing your thread or <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Yeah, I think you just like to, there\u2019s one part of you that\u2019s kind of like, \u201cNope, that\u2019s it. I want nothing to do with this, you know, this kind of, whether this is repulsing me, or whether this just doesn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t want any part of it.\u201d And then some other part of you that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">totally left high and dry by that, and is panicky and worried about things like, and understandably like security, and how to help handle it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562144\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And but parts like don\u2019t really talk to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: They certainly don\u2019t strategize together. I think they do talk to each other, but not in very collegial terms. They just kind of, I\u2019m just kind of whipsawed between the two of them. And they both have a logic. You know, they both have good arguments. Maybe not the right arguments at any given time, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: Well I think the arguments of the part that\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m done, and I\u2019m having nothing to do with it\u201d are I think <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">Like a little more, like a little more regressive, I think, a little more self, sort of involve a little more paranoid, I guess what I haven\u2019t\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Maybe, maybe. And it may be you know, there has to be some, it\u2019s like you know, in any given situation, there are two, you know, kind of polarities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">In any given kind of social situation, there are two kind of polarities. One, you know, pole, is \u201cThis isn\u2019t working for me,\u201d or you know, \u201cI don\u2019t want to engage with this person, just to strip it down to the kind of rudimentary element.\u201d And the other polarity is, \u201cI really want to, you know,\u201d for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">whatever reason, and the reasons are always complex, you know, \u201cI want to establish a relationship with this person.\u201d And this individual, and you know, there has to be some facility, ability to say, \u201cOkay, this doesn\u2019t meet my needs, I need to go elsewhere.\u201d This doesn\u2019t, you know, this, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\">ideology of my father\u2019s doesn\u2019t meet my needs. I need to go elsewhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">This, you know, group of work group doesn\u2019t meet my needs, I need to go elsewhere. This, you know, vocation is not fulfilling to me, I need to go elsewhere. And the problem that I think has been occasioned by my perfectly reasonable search for security has been in part that, you know, I gravitated, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">I would say in retrospect, toward unsuitable, you know, places of work that didn\u2019t meet my needs. So it\u2019s not just a kind of reflexive regressive whatever, it\u2019s, you know, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt that my behavior has been regressive in many, you know, in many instances. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">But it\u2019s not intrinsically wrong, I don\u2019t think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I feel directly that that part of you doesn\u2019t just think, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t want to form a relationship.\u201d It also thinks, \u201cI can\u2019t trust this person,\u201d and you know, often, like they\u2019ve already wronged you, which in some cases they have. You know, get very angry and wary about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: And why is this regressive, per se? I feel like I need to defend it a little bit because it\u2019s not totally clear to me that it is, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Okay, well yeah, let\u2019s hash it out. I mean, I think it\u2019s because though there may be some, there often is, some truth, you tend to kind of run with it too far and to assume it\u2019s completely unworkable in a way that is generally, in the short term, proved otherwise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">And then I think part of the problem that results from that is that the other part of you really doesn\u2019t know what to think. And I mean, if that first part was kind of wary, but kind of you could trust it, you know, to make a good judgment about where not to work, this would be much easier for you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">I think. The problem is, that you know, like If Jennie\u2019s (sp) depressed for a while, if Phil happens to be a flaky guy, nothing bad or malevolent guy, but not really dependable guy. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562144\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">If you know, there are institutional dynamics that are going to get in the way of getting, you know, a suitable sort of niche for yourself, like those are real problems. I don\u2019t doubt that at all, and those have absolutely those sorts of things have gotten in the way of your being able to work with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">the relevant people at times. But I think, you know, the way it feels to you at the time where you kind of shut down and you get angry and you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re really being betrayed and screwed over, you have a lot of trouble sort of approaching or talking to them about it, or trying to broach <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200672\">it. Like that, you know, while I agree there is kind of some truth in that you, and also almost always proves to involve like some distortion of what\u2019s going on, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">Which I think is a problem, not because like, well I\u2019ve got to see things how they are, but because then it\u2019s really hard for you to know sort of what for you to trust, you know what I mean? Like you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019re going too far, and like being apparent about it, or whether, you know, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">is, you know, there\u2019s really a problem that, you know a problem that can be work. And that, I think, you kind of go back and forth on. Or like I think it\u2019s part of what gets complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to relate this to the question of memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Well <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: And kind of acclimatization. This, so you added this tension between these two sort of states of being, sort of habitual states of being. One of them is, one of them rejects self-protectively, and the other of them, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Like gets really worried and tries to make things work, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Tries to make things work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: And gets sort of anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Gets concerned about, yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: Sometimes desperate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Right, right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Okay. So\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: And the forgetting happens from the first one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Forgetting happens from the first one, it\u2019s a rejection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s part of the rejection that happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: So your read on why I sometimes don\u2019t remember the contents of our previous conversation is that I\u2019m feeling a lack of progress and betrayed by the inadequacies of the process and so just to say, \u201cThe hell with it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: I think there is this part of you that\u2019s, you know, sort of, that does that, yeah. I clearly, there\u2019s a lot of you that doesn\u2019t, because you keep coming in and talking, you know, but you do, yeah, I think so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Okay. I mean, you know, whether it\u2019s right or not, I\u2019m not totally sure, but it\u2019s certainly internally consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s an interesting way to put it. I mean, you see why I mean\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t know. That makes sense. That\u2019s a plausible explanation, because I do have an excellent memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, even the memory that you were just referring to from however long ago it was, in the library. You said it was very vivid and clear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: I have an excellent memory. Even for childhood events, but also for adult ones, so you know, I mean the fact that my sleep is disrupted when I\u2019m stressed out, and all these things do interfere with the functioning of it, but in general, kind of my native organic capacity to remember things is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">quite good, so these large holes in it are something that need to be explained somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562144\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">Okay, now what? Am I challenging you again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: You may be, a little. My inclination would be, and what comes to mind, although I imagine that might annoy you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019ll be all right, don\u2019t worry about that. Are you wary of annoying me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m wary of annoying you if it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t mind annoying you, exactly. It\u2019s more like I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s provocative and I don\u2019t want to do something that like, you know, gets into a thing that doesn\u2019t feel productive, you know, like that. Your annoyance, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a person who\u2019s easily annoyed, but I guess these are sensitive questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well, I think though, and I think that the way in which we\u2019re doing this together, and you\u2019re putting yourself in my hands, you know, sort of evokes some of these kinds of responses that we\u2019re talking about, which, you know, many situations do not, I think. (Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a funny thing, you know, to express anger by forgetting things, or to express rejection by forgetting things. It\u2019s a little like holding your breath. You know, if you do not meet my needs, then I will stop functioning. If you do not meet my needs, then I\u2019ll do something that, then I\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">harm myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">It\u2019s a kind of self-destructive threat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s like, \u201cThen I will just banish you from my mind.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Okay, that\u2019s a little different. Banish you from my mind. That\u2019s not the way that it works, really. That\u2019s not the way that it works out, I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Right. There\u2019s a little kiddish quality to both. I guess that\u2019s part of it, like holding the breath, (inaudible at 00:39:47).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: All of this seems a little kiddish. I think one of the reasons is that it\u2019s so mystifying, has been so difficult to, you know, for me to intervene in a pattern that I\u2019ve seen very clearly for quite some time now is just that it\u2019s so clearly, got tangled up in these developmental processes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">I don\u2019t know, you know, I don\u2019t know how to walk it back. I don\u2019t know how to walk, you know how to walk my childhood back. I don\u2019t know how to walk, these things feel primary, these impulses that you were talking about. You know, your proposition is plausible, and you know, if I accept that that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">the case, then we\u2019re talking about, you know, the way that I respond on some basic level, and the only thing that\u2019s hopeful, I guess, is that in these intimate relationships, I\u2019ve been able to do otherwise. So clearly I have some capacity, given the satisfaction of certain, you know, criteria, to engage <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD2\">in a different way, and yet in this one very important area of my life, I\u2019ve just been really laid low by this, you know, way of responding to certain social interactive processes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: To me, it seems a little less kind of either or than that, that actually, I think with the work stuff, things have improved from that, probably have to resign from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Oh, in the, when I came to see you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: We haven\u2019t really seen that degree of paralysis in a while. Some paralysis, absolutely. Some periods where it really mattered and you really couldn\u2019t, absolutely, but not for a long time, and not categorically. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562144\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">And I think over time has gotten less, and I also think, you know, this is not unrelated to the intimate relationship stuff. You know, which may be a sort of related to sort of the way you\u2019re working on it here, and also obviously with just, you know, getting much closer to the cause.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: Just not quite a tangent, but an interjection. The feeling that I had when I passed those two people in the stairwell at (inaudible at 00:42:50), was exactly the feeling that I had when you said working on it here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">Something about that makes me uncomfortable, and I mean, you know, maybe psychotherapeutic jargon has something to do with it, but the feelings are too close, they\u2019re too similar for that to be accidental.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: That seems to me quite important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah.

No, I\u2019m not (inaudible at 00:43:51) stopping that if I didn\u2019t have, if I had something I felt like useful or (inaudible at 00:43:56) to say about it, I would.
