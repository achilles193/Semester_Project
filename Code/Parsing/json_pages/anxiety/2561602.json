(therapist affirms) Yeah. Uh... (pause) I guess last week, mostly, that\u2019s what I did, and then hung out with sort of (chuckles)... (pause) I feel like this is a very different phase of my life. (chuckles) (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">responds) It feels very strange. I don\u2019t know what to think about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(pause) (sighs) Like staying at his place and like, spending, you know, so much time with him. In the back of my mind, I\u2019m thinking of Chris and you know, what is he doing at this moment? Is he eating, what is he eating, is he working (chuckles)...? I keep thinking I have to end this with Nelson (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">and go back to Chris or (chuckles)... Like, constantly felt that conflict, I guess. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">[pause 00:04:50 to 00:05:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">Last night, as soon as like, Nelson dropped me off at home, I called Chris (chuckles). He was like, \u201cDo you want to come over and watch TV?\u201d (chuckles) And we had dinner and just talked the whole night. I was crying and crying, just because... (inaudible). Then I was a little calm, a little light, but... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">it\u2019s just, I feel so like... When I\u2019m panicking, I think, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d You know? Like, I didn\u2019t really end things with Chris. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m over him or I don\u2019t know if I want to be over him, I think I love him. You know, I\u2019ve started things with Nelson (ph) and, you know, what do I do? (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">(therapist responds) (pause) Then I just put that aside and think of work and think of things to do, constructive things, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: What do you think made you call Chris right away, after seeing Nelson?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Well, it was building up. I hadn\u2019t really talked to him in like, twenty days. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty days\u201d (therapist responds) like, since before Christmas. (sighs) So... mostly, it was because Nelson was in town or on break and like, but also because I didn\u2019t, I wanted to stay at my place <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">more, so... (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I\u2019ve been staying alone (ph), but at my place, you know, working there and stuff. So I wanted to do that. But yeah, so it was building up, not seeing him and not talking to him. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s guilt, or if it\u2019s, if I\u2019m genuinely losing him. I guess it\u2019s both. So then, I just couldn\u2019t take any <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">more. Like, we talked about seeing, watching (inaudible) together, or just watching it. We\u2019re doing that, watching it because, you know, the site crashed or something, but... You know, so that was like, the, the pretext. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I don\u2019t know, I guess I want to say I missed him, so... (pause) Like, all that, all the things he would say, or you know like, his ability to be so smart (chuckles), or even funny. I missed all that. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess I just, I was thinking of (inaudible) ... Is it okay if I put my feet here?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561602\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, they\u2019re all wet!

So I was, in that context, I was thinking like, \u201cWhy did I destroy, you know, my relationship with Chris? Why didn\u2019t I... You know, why did I do that like, two years ago? Why was I so unhappy?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">There was really no concrete reason to be that unhappy. I didn\u2019t like, you know, have a disaster happen to me, you know. I just created it, this disaster thing. I mean, I just went ahead and destroyed like, our little home. I mean, I wasn\u2019t happy in it and I was, it wasn\u2019t like a sweet little home, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">you know. But I was quite unhappy, so that\u2019s why I destroyed it, but it\u2019s still kind of, feel like that\u2019s what I did. (therapist responds) You know, I don\u2019t know if that narrative is (sighs) accurate or sufficient or helpful or (inaudible) (chuckles). Chris was like, \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself; you\u2019re doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">that again.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to think of it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">[pause 00:09:34 to 00:09:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">I guess I want to be, to learn how to be happy, by myself, on my own and take as much responsibility of that, so that next time something happens (or even if it doesn\u2019t happen), I can still relate to other people (chuckles). (therapist responds) I don\u2019t know. What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve just talked about wanting more responsibility, and then you\u2019re asking me what I think. Is it...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, no, no it\u2019s not that! It\u2019s just like, I\u2019m just wondering, because... Is it... I\u2019m a bit confused about like, how much do you... not blame other people, but like... If you have a conflict with someone, if they make, if you want them to change their behavior, how much of that is on you, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">how much of that is on them? (therapist responds) And if I find Chris boring, how much (chuckles) of that can I expect to change and how much of that is like, in my own head, in my own experience, my own feeling that I should be able to take care of? You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a very good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how to... I guess it depends on, on people to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: (pause) You said your mother always said you had a destructive personality. How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I don\u2019 t know. I guess I had anger issues, even when I was a child. I\u2019d just like, throw things (chuckles). Yeah, I guess that\u2019s what she meant. Like, spend time just breaking things or, yeah. Instead of building things, or drawing... (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: (pause) It seems to take your behavior out of context. I imagine you were reacting to what was going on around you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I was, yeah, (chuckles) subconsciously. I mean consciously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I mean, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s a... I\u2019m sorry to interrupt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, no. Yeah, consciously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I mean, saying it\u2019s a part of your personality is... different than thinking about your behavior as a response to what was going on around you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, she just said tendencies. I guess that\u2019s what she was saying, tendencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Do you think she sees herself that way, too? That she has destructive tendencies?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: No, she would say that she tries to be as constructive and creative as possible, which is probably true. She does, actually. (chuckles) She does spend a lot of time making things, just because she has the skills. Like, her mother passed that, all those skills on to her like, stitching and embroidery, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">you know. I don\u2019t do any of those (chuckles), so...

(chuckles) Like I said, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s accurate or helpful, taking the blame, or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, the way, one way in which it doesn\u2019t make sense is you weren\u2019t happy with him. (client responds) And so, at least, I mean, I\u2019m not... That sounds more global than I meant it, because, well, but you weren\u2019t. I mean, there were many ways in which you weren\u2019t happy. So to break <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">up something you weren\u2019t happy with doesn\u2019t really fit with \u201cdestructiveness.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. What is destructiveness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: (pause) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s your word! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know, just felt like, maybe, if you destroy something that was built by someone, by you, you know. Undoing this, un-made the sweater (chuckles) you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I mean, it seems more destructive to be dating people while you\u2019re with him than it is to break up with him. That seems destructive, because what purp , like what good things can come of it? (client affirms) Your...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: But now it\u2019s destructive both ways, with us (ph) like... You know, because we both have... (chuckles) What were you going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I mean, I don\u2019t know if feelings can be destructive. I think of behavior as destructive, more than feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Oh... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Your feelings are what your feelings are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s, that\u2019s so, that, yeah. That\u2019s a good point. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to control and... not seeing Chris, like not sleeping with him, is Step One. Step Two is (chuckles) not staying at his place. (therapist responds) So those two I\u2019m trying to take care of. Step Three, like completely <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">shutting off contact is very hard. Now, if I were a stronger person, a true (ph) person, I would do that, but that\u2019s the thing that I\u2019m struggling with, and that\u2019s the thing that I don\u2019t even think isn\u2019t necessary or I can do it, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

It\u2019s not clear why... I mean, you feel like cutting off contact with Chris would be constructive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re getting there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it was constructive. I guess, so yeah, you said, behavior can be destructive. So, yeah, seeing him would be destructive, yeah. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Because...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Because he\u2019ll confuse me and keep me in this limbo state. But... yeah. But I feel like I have a need to see him like, yeah. Yeah. (chuckles) (pause) I mean, I didn\u2019t want to see him at all, actually. And then my mom invited him and other people to her place. I was actually like... almost going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">to say to her, \u201cDon\u2019t invite him!\u201d I don\u2019t know, I, in fact, tried, I texted him and said, \u201cAre you going to go?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, it will be fun!\u201d I was like, \u201cDamn!\u201d (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561602\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">So then, after I hung out a little, I realized, \u201cOhhh... you know, like, I miss that!\u201d (chuckles) So... Yeah, it was just like, to give him (ph) anything (inaudible). (pause) I\u2019m... yeah. I\u2019m just concerned I\u2019m not (inaudible). I mean the biggest thing with like, as far as, I mean, intellectual growth <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">or like, I don\u2019t know, I just wonder like, \u201cDo I write better now with him?\u201d (chuckles) (therapist responds) It\u2019s a silly question. I don\u2019t know. My friend says, you know, \u201cWe write better when we\u2019re happy,\u201d and that is for sure, because even that was a question that I didn\u2019t have an answer to. Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200812\">I still don\u2019t, but I feel like I do now. But I don\u2019t think I can write better when I\u2019m sad, in my own like, concrete like, have my own life or something wrong. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">Yeah, sure, I tap into sadness when I\u2019m writing, but that\u2019s not the same. I am myself happy and contented, but I\u2019m like, tapping into an emotion. (therapist responds) And there is like... a clock in front of me and I know that I will tap into that until 5:00. Then I can go and like, party or (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">you know, like have fun. So that makes me like, motivated to work. So that\u2019s, for me is good. But then, you know, there is all this like, anxiety or guilt or maybe even genuine like, affection that kind of takes me back to Chris, like in my head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">(pause) Watching... I\u2019ve been watching a lot of TV (chuckles) with Nelson. One thing we were watching was this documentary, or he told me about it and (sighs)... It must have been (ph) then, I was telling Chris about it last night. It took him like, two seconds to pronounce judgment on it! He was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">\u201cOh, this is so reductive!\u201d And I was like, \u201cDamn!\u201d You know? This is, he\u2019s so smart or you know like... Like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I think of that? You know? So then I was like, hypothesizing or extrapolating. Like, \u201cIf I end up with Nelson, I will be dumb!\u201d (chuckles) There won\u2019t be this smart person to tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">me that, you know, this kind of stuff is reductive or that kind of stuff is brilliant! (chuckles) Very silly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Why did you think he was right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Because he\u2019s smart! He\u2019s right!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s right about, he knows everything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Not everything, I don\u2019t think. But he\u2019s pretty smart! (therapist responds) (pause) I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s important for you to think he knows everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is. (therapist responds) But why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good question. (client chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">[pause 00:22:09 to 00:22:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just like... I\u2019m trying, I mean, I know I\u2019ve made like, a mess, but I don\u2019t want to think about it that way and beat myself up too much, because... you know (chuckles) I guess I just want to take a step back, and maybe even laugh at the situation. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t do that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">very often. I beat myself up and I feel bad, so... It\u2019s nice to, to humor myself a little bit? I don\u2019t know like, I actually, genuinely sometimes just feel lucky that... you know, I (chuckles) I have these, you know, two great guys, you know, who care about me, you know. Sure, they\u2019ll be mad as hell <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">(chuckles) if they knew certain things, but... (pause) They kind of do and they kind of don\u2019t need to know certain details. I don\u2019t know. But I just, yeah, like (sighs) since I\u2019m unable to like, have... Like, I don\u2019t have a family or siblings, you know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s nice to have some people (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200973\">who care, you know? (therapist responds) (pause) Because I care about them, too, I guess, so it\u2019s just like, it\u2019s been reciprocated. I\u2019m lucky that they do. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561602\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">Like this whole week, I was, I tried, last week I tried to work as well. I had these grand plans that completely kind of... I didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t able to hold up to my plan. Like, pulling like 30%, but still, at least, you know, I came home and you know, sat at my desk for a few hours, and tried. (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">So like, even during the snowstorm like, Nelson would, you know, drop me off or walk me in, and pick me up later. So... you know, I was like, \u201cThere is so much snow! I\u2019m just going to stay home. You know, why do you want to dig out your car?\u201d So he was like, \u201cLet me figure that out,\u201d you know? And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200992\">was like, \u201cYou really want to pick me (chuckles) up later?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, let me figure that out.\u201d So that was, you know like, sure it\u2019s like the manly response and all that, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">I guess it was nice, to be like, to be taken care of, you know? (therapist responds) Like (chuckles), this is a little silly of me to think that, but you know like, I wish I were little and had my dad say that, you know? On, you know, on a daily basis, or a weekly, or monthly, or even a yearly (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">basis, you know? (therapist responds) I think that years and years of having that is what makes people strong and, you know, secure. I don\u2019t know if you would agree, but (chuckles)... (therapist responds) And not having that at all, and having something destructive in its place, is obviously... going <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B2\">to make a person crazy. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">And then he bought me a winter jacket, because he was like... \u201cYou need one.\u201d (chuckles) So, I mean, it\u2019s nice to be, you know, taken care of, I guess. (therapist responds) Not, I mean, and I\u2019m not trying to compare or anything, but like, I\u2019m sure Chris would do something like that, in his own mild, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">own mild ways. He wouldn\u2019t dig out his car! He didn\u2019t step out in the snow for days (chuckles) he said. He\u2019s not like, enterprising in that respect. But he\u2019s, you know, enterprising in soft, in scholarship, so... (therapist responds) And I\u2019m learning to recognize that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">I would just, earlier I would just say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s boring, he\u2019s just not enterprising, he\u2019s not, he\u2019s low energy,\u201d but... because I am comparing it, I guess I\u2019m able to kind of refine my judgment a bit more and realize that, \u201cNo, he spends all of his energy thinking,\u201d you know? It\u2019s not that he\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">energetic, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s cerebral, it\u2019s spent that way. (therapist responds) And other people, other guys, spend it digging out, shoveling snow, you know? (chuckles) (pause) Not that Chris wouldn\u2019t shovel snow. Last year, I think he did. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m more calm when I think of things this way, (therapist responds) when I feel like... lucky and stuff, but... Then, you know, later on I\u2019m like, \u201cBut still, I have to resolve. I can\u2019t just have both of them in my life.\u201d (chuckles) (pause) I feel so horrible and guilty when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">think of Chris\u2019s mom, and you know like, her expectations of us getting married, and the fact that she still doesn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561602\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You feel guilty because you feel you led her on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah...

(chuckles) Like...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Well, I had a couple of thoughts. Like, that you might know things like, you might understand about a T , you might have a perspective on a TV show that Chris just doesn\u2019t know or understand, for example. Or even when you ask me... Well, the reason why I asked it at that moment is like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">you asked me questions about your emotional life that I, I don\u2019t have the answers to, but I think you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that scares me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Well, I was wondering. I was wondering if there is something that is sort of hard to, hard about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Talking about me knowing more? (therapist affirms) What, I never thought (ph) about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, because you look to people so much, to sort of be sort of experts or oracles or... (client affirms) And to think of other people as that way, and more of yourself as someone who could have answers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">[pause 00:30:23 to 00:30:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">Do you see what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019ve never... You know, why, I\u2019m like, why would that scare me, that I know more? Wouldn\u2019t that, wouldn\u2019t it better, you know? Yeah, I\u2019m trying to think if that\u2019s the case (chuckles). (pause) What if I\u2019m wrong? Yeah, maybe that\u2019s the scary bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Well, but you could be as wrong as anybody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: It\u2019s (inaudible) (blocked) Yeah but that\u2019s scary!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: That you could be wrong or that anyone could be wrong? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Well, me (chuckles) first. Like, yeah, I was watching this documentary and... I got into it because Nelson was like, \u201cThis is interesting.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah, yeah; it looks interesting!\u201d And then I was like, watching it and I was not that interested in it, but I didn\u2019t quite know what was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">wrong until Chris was like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s reductive!\u201d He didn\u2019t say reductive, you know, whatever he said like, Yeah. So... I guess he put his finger on the thing that was bothering me, but then I was also like, a little disappointed that he didn\u2019t like it, because... I don\u2019t know. Maybe this is a bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D52\">example, but like... (pause) But like yeah, I mean like, (sighs) if you like something and the other person, or everyone else knows that it\u2019s something bad for you, or just generally bad, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s scary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: But I don\u2019t know. How would bad be determined? It\u2019s just different people\u2019s opinion, in the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561602\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, but... I don\u2019t know. Now I can\u2019t think (chuckles). (pause) I\u2019m just still not comfortable with the idea that different people have different opinions, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not fine. I want to take different people\u2019s opinions and order them, you know, into a hierarchy, evaluate them (chuckles). <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">I don\u2019t know why. (therapist responds) I feel more comfortable when I do that. (therapist responds) Like, I can orient myself (chuckles). This democracy thing doesn\u2019t work for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Well, you can order them, but they\u2019re ultimately your ordering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that could be one thing that I have to learn, to keep my order to myself, or just know that other people have ordered things differently. (therapist responds) I mean, that is something that I am starting to learn, because I was, you know, completely in my shell until two years <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">ago and, you know, broke out of it to really just, experience new things, and I am. (chuckles) (therapist responds) So... that has been like, you know, being with Nelson first and then now like, Nelson and his friends, you know. I still, I mean, I went in and I (inaudible). But it\u2019s less and less now, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD2\">and there is more affection now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">But I always would go in, thinking, you know, these silly people who have so much money or, you know, who make money (because they have decent jobs), but they have no cultural capital or you know, very little cultural capital. I\u2019m just, you know, went in with that judgment and then slowly kind of learned <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">to let that go and appreciate things that they appreciate. (therapist responds) I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the same thing that you were talking about, different order. (therapist affirms) (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">But my reaction is not to go back to Chris and be like, \u201cYou\u2019re just a pompous ass, you know? You\u2019re just like, you\u2019re just all intellect! You just judge people!\u201d I\u2019m not doing that. I\u2019m going back and like, \u201cOn what kind of, what\u2019s the reason? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reason.\u201d (ph) (chuckles) Kind of opinion <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">that, \u201cYeah, so I see where you\u2019re coming from, you know, you\u2019ve mostly, you know, your understanding of things is mostly textual and your order of things is like, it stems from this, this, and this aspect of your reading. Whereas other people, they don\u2019t have any of that training. They go by guts, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">you know? They\u2019re more consumers, and they just are turn on the TV, and you know, watch whatever appeals to them,\u201d (chuckles), you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">Yeah, I guess I\u2019m kind of, I guess I, the next step is to realize, to be kind to both these orders. (chuckles) (therapist responds) But instead, something else happens where (which is what happened last night, it was like, oh, you know, it\u2019s a mini example), but there was panic when I realized, \u201cOh! <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">Chris is right! This is bad!\u201d (chuckles) You know? \u201cWhat was I thinking?\u201d Then, you know, extrapolating that for, and then be like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to be consistently wrong and stupid, if I don\u2019t end up with Chris!\u201d (chuckles) (therapist responds) You know, that is the panic that is like, really causing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E32\">me to cling to him, to call him, over like, I did last week, to answer your first question. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561602\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">[pause 00:37:16 to 00:38:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">I mean, so I guess there is a lot of panic and guilt associated with my (inaudible) to see him.

(pause) I mean, I feel like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">I mean I\u2019d played a kind of game with Nelson, but I\u2019m like, I try to break up or try to like... not half-heartedly, I guess, but then he kind of... connives me into staying with him. Maybe \u201cconnives\u201d is not the right word, but it feels pretty conniving (chuckles). (pause) Do we have time left? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You have a minute or so.

(therapist responds) (pause) Yeah, I mean, so I don\u2019t know if you can answer this question, but I feel like perhaps it would be helpful to think of breaking up with Chris as coming to something constructive. (therapist responds) I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">I keep thinking that, \u201cOh, God! I destroyed everything I had and built from scratch!\u201d But then, there is building on that, you know? Rebuilding your life, right? I mean (chuckles)... So... Like, looking at it as something I destroyed, but then, there is, you know like, not wanting to live with my mom, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB2\">not wanting to live with Chris could be seen as, you know like, needing to grow, and growth is constructive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I never thought... I mean, whether you want to be with Chris or not is one issue, but it never seemed like breaking up with him itself was destructive, because you weren\u2019t happy. So you were trying to do something about it. When people\u2019s motivations are very mixed and complicated, it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">one thing or the other. But I certainly don\u2019t see your breaking up with Chris as purely destructive. (client responds) Again, I saw you... and again, even this is not purely destructive, but you staying with Chris and then seeing these other guys is far more destructive than you deciding to leave him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah.
