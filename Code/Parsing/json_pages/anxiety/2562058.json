[Pause] I guess this is kind of [inaudible at 00:01:47] but I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019ve been kind of feeling, I don\u2019t know. Yes, I guess kind of in a blah or in a fog or something and I don\u2019t know. I guess, just, I don\u2019t know I guess just a feeling of not wanting to do very much. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">[pause] I don\u2019t know, just work stuff I feel like I kind of want to push everything off or, and I don\u2019t know [pause] kind of needing a break or at least. But I don\u2019t know I feel like I just had a break but I don\u2019t know. [Pause] Yes, I guess I just feel like I\u2019m kind of not functioning at whole mode <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">or whatever. I just feel like kind of doing the bare minimum or I don\u2019t know. [Pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">So I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m kind of looking for kind of not help but kind of like inspiration from people of what to do or for distraction but I guess it always feels kind of worse. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not really sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: What are we sort of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019ve gotten further off track or I need recovery time from spending time with others or I don\u2019t know. Just kind of I guess just less protected if I\u2019m distracted or hanging out with others. But I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I guess I\u2019m not really thinking much other that just kind of treating it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">like another day of doing a bunch of stuff but trying not to get exhausted by anything or try to get as much as soon as I can done but I don\u2019t know. [Pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I wonder if other people entirely [inaudible at 00:08:58] and puts in touch with some things you\u2019re feeling bad about like stuff like your brother, stuff that you\u2019re worried about like grad school. And it is hard to sort of put that away and really refocus on work or things that make you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">feel more energized. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: [Pause] I guess. I don\u2019t know. I guess, I guess I just seem to like things that are kind of repetitive and even kind of, I don\u2019t know. Just at work and seeing people and it just kind of seems like [pause] just kind of the same and always kind of makes me feel the same kind of not accomplished <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">or not getting a lot done. And I guess it\u2019s hard for me to kind of be resilient, I guess, from kind of feeling this way or kind of beat. Personally it\u2019s like a bolt of, I don\u2019t know, kind of not work or not be hard on myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: [Pause] Being hard on yourself or staying with your work rather than doing something else. Those things, they usually win? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well, other, I guess they\u2019re distractions. I\u2019m more, I don\u2019t know, easily persuaded by other people not to do my work or not to bend. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Sorry. I mean, I knew you were saying that somebody\u2019s trying to say not to be hard on yourself or go (ph) by yourself or no, take it easy, take a break, don\u2019t work so hard. Usually they lose and feeling better at yourself or queuing (ph) with your work wins. But it\u2019s not that way. Sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">people will kind of pull you off what you\u2019re doing but then you\u2019ll feel lousy for it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right, yes. I don\u2019t know. Like an example Saturday I went to work but then Marlowe was with Bernie and he said don\u2019t work, don\u2019t work, I know you\u2019ve been through a lot today. And I don\u2019t know, so just other things. But I think it\u2019s just the feeling of not getting what I need to be doing done <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">and I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562058\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m kind of feeling anxious and kind of unable to do it all or kind of deal with everything or I don\u2019t know. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I see so [inaudible at 00:17:58] Devin meaning that he\u2019s been away trying to be this kind of, just like more playing on your weakness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. [Pause] That\u2019s it\u2019s hard to describe. I don\u2019t know. I just feel now I want to be doing a lot more work and just things for myself and, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t it\u2019s hard to do the things or it\u2019s hard to some people were (ph) were not being kind of but I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">know if I\u2019m torn because I don\u2019t want anything, I don\u2019t know. And any more I feel like I need sort of, I need to feel a break or relief still. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s kind of hard to describe. [Pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Because the situation is, or how you\u2019re feeling is in a way irreconcilable in that you\u2019re going to get angry at yourself and feel down if you don\u2019t work harder and get more done and be more disciplined. At the same time, you\u2019re going to be unhappy if you don\u2019t get a break or a chance to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">it easy or and that\u2019s all true at the same time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. [Pause] It\u2019s kind of like, I don\u2019t know, like saying I\u2019m going on with a hike with someone and that person wants to take breaks all the time and it\u2019s hard hiking so I understand why they want to take breaks; I get tired too. But I know I can keep going or a break later, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">stopping, pushing through would be just more I always feel better; I\u2019m more productive. But it\u2019s hard so or I\u2019m tired and so I am easily persuaded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">And then the bag just, I don\u2019t know. And then once we stop, all the soreness kind of [inaudible at 00:22:46] all the because I\u2019m just kind of pushing through. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I guess I keep thinking about are you imagining how that may seem simple here because if you are on a hike and I keep talking about well where are you sore and how sore and in what way and how are we deciding together when we take breaks and if we\u2019re taking breaks and what we may need. Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">really kind of takes away from the hiking part which is the part that so often makes you feel better, like you\u2019re accomplishing something and capable and together.  [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. I guess I just feel like I keep on falling into the same repetition, like I can never kind of do what I want and I know I need to do them or change my focus or I don\u2019t know or do something else or I don\u2019t know. Some of it seems so mundane or progressing or not doing anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s very hard because this is the way that you know and the way that has worked to the extent that it\u2019s worked, you have to stay focused and work hard and get things done and keep pushing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right. And I don\u2019t like the other alternative or [pause] I mean I don\u2019t know what to do I mean it\u2019s [inaudible at 00:31:04]. [Pause] I guess I just feel angry and I don\u2019t know what I can do to balance kind of the cycle that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. It seems like I tried but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: When you refer to the other alternative, what do you have in mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562058\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Just kind of not pushing myself, kind of just doing work when I feel like it or I don\u2019t know, just not caring. I don\u2019t know. [Pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I see. You don\u2019t want it to turn into something I think that you don\u2019t really respect and sort of don\u2019t want for yourself and I think know wouldn\u2019t work, like you just wouldn\u2019t react well to that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right, I\u2019d just feel guilty. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I think you feel I\u2019m trying to push that one on you sometimes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: [Pause] No but I don\u2019t things are more complicated. I mean I do feel like other people try to do that, maybe they need it, but I don\u2019t know. I think there\u2019s something else or something kind of to kind of loosen the grip or something kind of, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: [Pause] You mean like have a sense of, have a third thing in mind but sort of blank what that is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Or it involves kind of your becoming more flexible about how you do things than you are now? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Right. Or, yes, but I guess what I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t I don\u2019t know. I just cannot leave something and do nothing or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: So one thing that seems clear is that these, the two ways that you spell out, the way you want to be doing things and the alternative that you don\u2019t like, I think are both really yours. Now it may be that other people kind of take up the mantle of, like Marlowe, of the alternative way but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">I think it\u2019s actually your construction. It\u2019s your fantasy and I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true of how you do things but I mean it\u2019s your own idea that if you\u2019re not sort of focused and disciplined and so forth that you won\u2019t do anything or I mean it\u2019s sort of like a foil. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. Well, yes, I feel like I have to kind of push off or push through this laziness or this because if I don\u2019t do that then I won\u2019t do anything and then it kind of just makes things a little worse and then I push myself even more. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just like [pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well what\u2019s coming to mind? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess I just kind of feel frustrated that, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s these [inaudible at 00:43:55] that I want to do and I never seem to finish them or get to them. [Pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: What do you have in mind? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, just like work and I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m finding other things to do and, I don\u2019t know. [Pause] It seems like I\u2019m not able to change or, I don\u2019t know. [Pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well I do think you\u2019re pretty stuck in this dilemma. At least for my part, I don\u2019t need I\u2019d say you\u2019re not able to change. I think maybe we should stop. Also a scheduling thing, this is irrespective of whatever changes you [seem to pick] (ph). I had 7:45 kind of open up on Monday if you\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">rather that than the 9:15.
