I\u2019ve been a little constipated lately, which never happens to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: And that makes you worried that something serious is going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just uncomfortable and I generally get lower back discomfort. I\u2019m starting to wonder if once in a while my hypochondria is just whatever I hear or if a friend tells me or whatever. For whatever reason, if it somehow resonates or triggers something, then I just take it on. Like last week, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">one of my friends has been having really, really bad lower back pain and he has a stone or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: A kidney stone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. He was freaked out because that could be a sign of bad things if your lower back hurts that bad. So when I started feeling a little constipated, I had discomfort in my lower back so, of course, I\u2019m like \u201cwhy is this happening?\u201d I know it also happens when I\u2019m making changes or doing stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Like relationships or sex, that can be another kind of preoccupation that is oddly soothing. You just are focused on that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, like a distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: For some of the bigger things that are happening right now \u2013 which are huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s also a way of saying \u201cdon\u2019t get too excited because something bad is going to happen eventually.\u201d It\u2019s shitty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Like getting a kidney stone. It hurts. You may have to go to the hospital, but that doesn\u2019t need to stop you from going to Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Right, but the fact that you even have to go there in your mind \u2013 kidney stone? What the fuck? Yes, of course, if it were to happen, then you deal with it, but it\u2019s just so silly that my mind goes to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: The worst case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like welcome to your 40\u2019s. I think people get constipated. It just happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: People get back pain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah \u2013 especially people that always have a super-tight back. I always have to be careful about my posture and stuff. I\u2019ve probably jacked-up my back. It\u2019s been uncomfortable for years. On the up side, I did some writing yesterday and it was good. I think I\u2019m finally going to do a blog or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">There is a really nice, new platform that\u2019s very clean and looks very cool. It\u2019s mostly just for texts. I like what I wrote. It wasn\u2019t much \u2013 just two or three paragraphs \u2013 but they\u2019re keepers, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Fiction? Non-fiction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s kind of like a memoir\/something. I\u2019m finally trying to somehow write about this whole \u2013 whatever the hell this is and focus on the combination of what is it to feel like you\u2019ve been in a coma for so long?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: It seems to me that you wrote yesterday, of all days. I wonder why yesterday you wanted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I had started. I tried a few days ago, but I just didn\u2019t like what I wrote that much so I just went over it and rewrote it.  I don\u2019t know. There is definitely stuff that wants to come out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: But there is a difference between sitting in wait and then coming out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, it wasn\u2019t like it was that much, but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Actually, two paragraphs is very different than nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Of course \u2013 especially if they\u2019re keepers. They\u2019re not just stuff I wrote and I was like eh.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: But even if they weren\u2019t, Brian, you\u2019re minimizing the task of actually just sitting down and getting yourself to write. It\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I think it does count. Even if it\u2019s a terrible one paragraph, you wrote that day. That\u2019s being the artist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, there are going to be plenty of days where you don\u2019t keep what you wrote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Of course. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why. Part of it could be this new caf\u00e9 that I go to in Shrewsbury. It goes a long way if you feel really comfortable. Now I\u2019m leaving, and I just kind of discovered this place, but it\u2019s really spacious and the music is barely audible. The coffee is just right \u2013 it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">not some nasty, burnt shit. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s in Shrewsbury, so it\u2019s not like there are weird homeless people walking through every ten minutes or something. Not to put down homeless people, but if you\u2019re at 1369 there\u2019s a dude talking to himself and some lady that smells funny. So I don\u2019t know. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">think it\u2019s just very conducive. For someone like me who needs that white noise, it\u2019s perfect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: White noise not being noise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Exactly. It\u2019s just very faint and pleasant. I can look up and kind of take a little . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Not feeling over-stimulated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, not feel over-stimulated. It\u2019s really nice, really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I also wonder if it\u2019s away enough, too. Shrewsbury is not a coffee shop in Cheshire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don\u2019t see anyone there; no one looks familiar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Not a lot of signs around you that could trigger something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. And also a lot of the other people, there is a lot of conformity a little bit. A lot of the other people are on their laptops and everyone is kind of like doing their own thing. It\u2019s just a nice vibe, but somehow not pretentious or annoying, like Levi\u2019s or whatever. That could have <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">something to do with it. I don\u2019t know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You were also remembering more yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I mean in a pretty profound way. Do you remember?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course. Of course. (pause) Sure, all those things have to do with that feeling of being in a fog or feeling like you\u2019re not \u2013 you know. One thing I wrote yesterday is that the whole thing is that you feel . . . It\u2019s all poeticized and all that, but I broke it down into three things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">I think, which was that first you\u2019re kind of like a really shy, slightly melancholy kid. And then you go right into this PTSD young adulthood where everyone you know is dying or dead or whatever. (chuckles) Then I wrote, \u201cBut in the third part, that\u2019s the part that actually maybe caused the most of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">this coma-type thing. Then you, yourself, cause harm, in a way, to yourself and to others because you just don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re just sleepwalking.\u201d  If people die, they die. When you\u2019re a kid, you\u2019re a kid; you\u2019re a child. But then, without knowing, because you don\u2019t understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200613\">yourself. You can\u2019t figure out your context. You don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on. There is groping and trying. You know what I mean? I was writing about that. Then I was saying that the difference is that, generally, you drag yourself into the future. It might be messy, but there is at least some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200614\">sense of self-awareness and excitement. It might be messy or whatever, but then there is being dragged. (chuckles) There is that and then there is being dragged around like a rag doll with its eyes x\u2019ed out.  For whatever reason \u2013 it might be PTSD; it might be other issues. I was saying that we already <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200615\">have so little control, way less than we think we do in our lives. There is that. There is just the every day, but then there are the people who have even less because they\u2019re just being willy-nilly dragged around by this thing that\u2019s causing them to not really be able to understand their situation. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: You know, as much as some of the stories we were talking about yesterday \u2013 women when you were very young, girls, women \u2013 feeling like stories of your early, young, burgeoning sexual interest and preoccupation, the underside of so many of them is a kind of being dragged around and over-stimulated. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\"> Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course. It\u2019s way too young for a lot of this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s way too young.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: You have no idea what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: It matters that she\u2019s older. The story where she\u2019s 14 and you\u2019re 9, it actually matters a lot. There is a big difference. And of course you like it. Even people who are raped can have sexual feeling during rape. It doesn\u2019t mean you want it to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Really? Wow, that\u2019s really creepy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s an extreme, but bodies respond. Bodies respond when they\u2019re stimulated. They just do, so just because it felt good doesn\u2019t mean it was good for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, clearly. I forgot to tell you another one, which I don\u2019t know if I told you before. In North Carolina, we had very good friends of the family, very nice people. There were three or four occasions where their daughter, Eliza \u2013 she didn\u2019t touch me, but we would play this game or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">where I was like a photographer and she was like a model. The thing is it\u2019s hard to know when you\u2019re a kid what you exactly remember or don\u2019t, but I do remember feeling kind of stimulated or she was posing provocatively or something. I just remember. Maybe she wasn\u2019t, but I was a little boy and I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">like \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d  I seem to remember something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: You were [aroused sexually] (ph?) about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, something. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: You know, even some of what could be a kind of ordinary feeling in that story, like sometimes play can have an erotic overtone. That can happen, but if you start to couple that with being under-stimulated in so many other ways, it\u2019s like that was the source of stimulation, too; it became <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">a sexual one. I\u2019m contrasting that memory with your being \u2013 like the beige rug. You\u2019re a latch-key kid and you\u2019re alone and you\u2019re flipping through the TV all afternoon by yourself; then there is sexual stuff. Of course, that becomes a way to feel alive, then. It\u2019s the aliveness of feeling known and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">seen and loved in more benign, less-erotic ways, in a way that feels comforting and whole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Your memory is more of the garage \u2013 the gas station, in the garage with your dad and kicking a ball around. And yes, it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s him. You\u2019re with your dad and he\u2019s with his buddies, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s having a lot of interaction with you. It\u2019s really still quite lonely. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) Even in that way, I guess my dad and I were very different. My heater has not been working. My friend has been trying to fix it and ordered a part. His son always comes with him. His son is between 12 and 13 or whatever. It\u2019s like he has a genuine interest in his dad\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">a very nice kid, very bright, very polite, very sweet. \u2013 and he helps his dad. He\u2019s very smart. I didn\u2019t have that with my dad. If I was a different kind of kid, maybe, when I was at that garage, I\u2019d be like, \u201cDad, how do you do this? What\u2019s this?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Maybe I was just too shy to feign any <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">interest.  Feign \u2013 hah. It\u2019s a bummer in a way because it wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t interested, it kind of didn\u2019t seem fun. Sure, I\u2019d like to know how to take apart a carburetor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Not that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. We couldn\u2019t connect, really, on that. I loved him. I just loved him, but I couldn\u2019t connect on that level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: The shared activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Except for soccer. We had that. (pause) But even then I stopped doing it. It was just so weird when you\u2019re that shy. When we came back here I couldn\u2019t just play. There was a really good Assyrian league.  I didn\u2019t because at that point I was 13 or 14, so it\u2019s that age where you\u2019re starting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">. . . I just could not do it. I was so shy. That would have been nice. I probably would have made a lot of friends \u2013 and a lot of those people are life-long friends because of the community. And I would have been good. I\u2019m a pretty good soccer player. In some ways, not that I feel bad, but I do feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200852\">like more than . . . My mom and I \u2013 you know \u2013 but my dad and I, I think, if I was just less shy we could have connected on stuff. Instead it was just one thing to totally love your parents and another thing to have more interaction. Even for my own dad I was just kind of like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: Shy even with him maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, just something. I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but other kids were like, \u201cDad, I want to play soccer.\u201d I kept very much to myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I was wondering when you kept saying \u201cshy. I was so shy.\u201d What do you actually mean by that. It can actually mean a lot of different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Like getting along with everyone but never putting myself in certain situations. If I am in a situation, then I deal. It wasn\u2019t like I was some kind of outcast or freaky. It wasn\u2019t like that kind of thing. Even then, all this stuff started then. I didn\u2019t realize it.  No, it\u2019s actually everyone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">likes me. I just felt like there were the kids who were on the soccer team already \u2013 and then there\u2019s me. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? Whereas other kids either just don\u2019t think about that or they have enough gumption to be like \u201cbut I want to play.\u201d They just go and play. In some ways, it\u2019s even sadder <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">that I wasn\u2019t a freaky kid because that would explain it. Like in high school, there were kids I knew that there was something odd about them. They were probably lovely kids, but unfortunately going through that age range . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: They weren\u2019t going to, necessarily, fit in. There is not a place for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, they were not going to fit in. That wasn\u2019t the case for me. I went through all of high school thinking \u201cI don\u2019t fit in,\u201d only to look back and see \u201cwait a minute \u2013 everybody liked me in high school.\u201d  For some reason, from the very beginning I had a view of things that wasn\u2019t real. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">It\u2019s just amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: It really means, then, that in a way, you were kind of insecure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Probably. No, not probably \u2013 totally insecure; because at home you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being built up \u2013 kids are kids, right? They\u2019re robust and loud and so full of life, so if you\u2019re coming at it like everything is kind of negative and something and there is you and everybody else <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">then, of course, at that age you can\u2019t figure shit out. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: People already struggle with that feeling, even when things are going [relatively well.] (ph?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what it is to be a kid. Your parents are supposed to be the people that get you through that because they went through that themselves. But when your whole \u2013 not lineage \u2013 the trajectory is all fucked up, My parents \u2013 what could they relate to? There\u2019s nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">to relate to. They went through hell. There is none of this \u201c when you\u2019re a kid you get to . . .\u201d (chuckling) They\u2019re dealing with wolves and scorpions. They have real problems. It\u2019s in a totally different part of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: They couldn\u2019t relate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: [All of you were alone.] (ph?)  It\u2019s another way that the coma starts as a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. That\u2019s why that beige \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I said to you at the very end yesterday as you were talking about why these women are not stopping themselves and I said that you could, too, that the flip side of the story is do you want to be doing this? Is this good for you? Having agency over oneself has been missing, even when you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">being pulled into a closet; a 14-year-old making out with you. You\u2019re a passive recipient of the world happening to you instead of activating in your own mind deciding do I want to be doing this? Does this make sense for me? Does it feel right? (pause)  When you don\u2019t have anyone who recognizes your <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">experience and says \u201cI get it; I see you,\u201d you start losing \u2013 there\u2019s no perspective on you. The coma begins.(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s funny because yesterday I was doing some research and I looked up the courses that are going to be offered at the university in Assyria in the spring; and I was like \u201cwho is this person?\u201d I looked it up and it was this guy who attended a US school. It was good because, at first, I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">to where I would normally go, which would be like \u201cwho the fuck is this guy? This is my thing.\u201d  I\u2019ve always had that. That\u2019s the other thing that I had when I was a kid. Like remember when I got the stitches because the ketchup was out? I didn\u2019t like sharing. It took me a long time to learn how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A52\">share \u2013 like Pepsi, things that were my domain or whatever. (pause) Just the way I catch myself now with like \u201cwho is this fucking band?\u201d I try to stop myself and be like, first of all, who gives a shit? But second of all, it\u2019s a big world and there can be lots of good bands (chuckles) and whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A53\">You can\u2019t compare it. That\u2019s what my mom does.  It was kind of good that yesterday I stopped myself. I was like who gives a shit? What, am I the only person who\u2019s going to teach at the university? Because it immediately gave me fear that that\u2019s like my mom. But he\u2019s already there and he could be a better <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A54\">teacher than me. Maybe he\u2019s already done with his PhD and he\u2019s way smarter and he knows way more about literature than I do. Dude, what are you . . ? I had to stop myself, but then I forced myself to be like no, he\u2019s probably a really nice guy and it will be really cool. We\u2019ll probably be like friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A55\">and it will be someone who gets it who is from here.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Again, when there isn\u2019t a complete and solid foundation of feeling good about yourself, anything can feel like an intimidation of your sense of yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Right, which I hate because it means that sometimes it\u2019s like a tenuous self-confidence. It\u2019s real, but it\u2019s fragile sometimes. I don\u2019t like that. It had gotten way, way better, but I had to stop myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s still fragile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was like what the fuck, man? Who gives a shit? Some fucking dumb-ass from Indiana? He\u2019s probably a very nice guy. So what? This is what I thought about it: why didn\u2019t I feel that way about Walter in the U.K.? He\u2019s a little younger than me. And then I realized it\u2019s the Assyrian thing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">It\u2019s like a family. It triggers feelings, whereas Walter is a Jamaican dude. I\u2019m like oh, good. He\u2019s a totally different person. Good for him. He\u2019s a nice guy.  That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m slightly worried about, but I\u2019m just going to have to deal with it. I am different when I go to Assyrian events. It triggers; <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD2\">I immediately go back to being kind of all closed off and almost antagonistic. I want to be rebellious. There is so much conformity and everyone is looking at each other and gossiping. It\u2019s like you\u2019re going to a big family get-together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: It triggers all that stuff inside you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Instead of being able to stop and say, \u201cWait a minute. These are totally different people that have nothing to do with me.\u201d (pause)  Then there was also a positive because he teaches an American Literature Survey course. I was like \u201cthat\u2019s good.\u201d That means the woman is not blowing smoke. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">are wanting to do non-ESL, actual things, so that\u2019s good. I have plenty of ideas so . . . (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And the idea of mine, my Pepsi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s one thing I always feel bad about when I look back. My poor little cousin, my cousin, Nanni; she just wanted to copy everything I did. It was so cute, but I would get so angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: If she wanted a sip you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: No, it was like I wanted a Pepsi and she\u2019d want a Pepsi. If we go to the McDonald\u2019s after the swimming pool I\u2019ll have a Big Mac and she wants a Big Mac, too. That would make me angry because \u201cI\u2019m the big kid. You\u2019re little.\u201d But I would; for some reason I would really get upset. Like that was my thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Like your identity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I had that all through high school, unfortunately \u2013 not at the high school, but in other settings I would. There was a lot of stuff going on inside. I wanted attention, like \u201cwhy isn\u2019t this person paying attention to me?\u201d I would get so into a dark place. But again, on the other hand, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">I would actually do shit. Like now there are those moleskin notebooks? I would buy \u2013 not those, but sketchbooks and I would write in them and draw in them. To me that\u2019s more normal. You\u2019re a teenager going through hell.  There were lots of times where I would \u2013 what\u2019s it called? \u2013 self-flagellation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD2\">Like one time I drew all these characters \u2013 I can\u2019t draw at all \u2013 but I kept drawing big noses. I hated myself so much and I had acne. Here\u2019s the funny thing \u2013 there was this one girl, Amelia, when I was a sophomore or junior in high school; an Assyrian girl. I could have totally made a move on her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD3\">In retrospect, I was the one. We were hanging out, we were both artsy whatever we were back then, kind of half-punky, artsy, gothy, whatever the fuck, and here was this Assyrian-American girl. But instead I would go home \u201cshe doesn\u2019t like me\u201d and draw all these nasty pictures of myself.  Two things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD4\">One, I could have totally done something. I was the one who didn\u2019t make a move. And two, she\u2019s not even attractive. We\u2019re still friends, but she\u2019s totally not my type.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: There was so much self-loathing that you couldn\u2019t see what was real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s what I was trying to say yesterday that there are still pretty loud hints of that when you\u2019re talking about why these women are coming home with me? Of course, you get on the one hand why they are doing that and it would be better for them not to do that if they want a relationship. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C31\">On the other hand, there is still a part of you that sounds like you\u2019re in disbelief that maybe you\u2019re attractive to them and [ ] (inaudible at 00:34:02) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: I thought about that after I left here. That does happen all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s you and that will happen if you want it to with a lot of women. With every single woman that could happen because of you. You still don\u2019t quite know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t get that. I don\u2019t get that. (pause) That\u2019s where it is sad. It\u2019s conflagration of if your mom and your family are so focused on appearance and all that so you\u2019ve never felt attractive. But if you\u2019re hyper-sexualized young, those images of models or porn or whatever \u2013 that started. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">What\u2019s a lingerie magazine? Give me a break. It\u2019s just commercialized, G-rated porn.  I\u2019m sorry. Look at these thigh-high stockings. Come on. That doesn\u2019t help. So from a young age, clearly I\u2019m not attractive because I listen to what my family says about others; and I\u2019ve started way too early with the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C92\">images that are everywhere. I can\u2019t imagine now. This is a fucking nightmare when you\u2019re 12 and you just hop on . . . I can\u2019t even imagine the fucking stuff going on. Or just on your phone. Look at this disgusting or whatever image. I think that didn\u2019t help me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Dually focused on physical, physical, physical appearance. Erotic physical appearance and also the way you feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not normal. Those images are not every-day, normal, regular \u2013 both for women and men. These dudes that work out all day and have a huge penis or whatever. There are things about them that are not average people and women are looking at these thin chicks with huge breasts. (chuckles) If <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">you\u2019re not old enough to understand that that\u2019s a fantasy and it has nothing to do with . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Literally airbrushed often. Not real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: Oftentimes things aren\u2019t real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Or they have massive eating disorders. Men, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">CLIENT: There is just so much loaded in those kinds of things with nonsense that if you\u2019re way too young to get it \u2013 I mean older people don\u2019t get it, let alone . . . And then if you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re being put down all the time. Even if you\u2019re not you\u2019re putting yourself down all the time. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D51\">know what my point was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">THERAPIST: We were talking about the degradation of even your belief in . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: Oh, right. And then what happens now is that I get it and I don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s almost like a dual thing. Now I\u2019m very comfortable with who I am, but that\u2019s a little different than being comfortable with yourself just as an attractive object, like someone who can be objectified by someone else. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">Because that\u2019s fun, of course. When you\u2019re into somebody that\u2019s part of the fun. That is what attraction partly is.  I get the other parts. I like myself and I even get that I guess I\u2019m attractive. I feel good. I look in the mirror, but that level of visceral \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s tough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">THERAPIST: I wonder if one of the problems that you\u2019re talking about is that it\u2019s still so split between when I\u2019m talking about myself, approval of myself, and then attractive. And attractive, the way you talk about it, is only . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">CLIENT: No, I can see how they\u2019re attracted to that part. Of course. There is being attracted to the person and then there is being attracted like \u201cI just want to bang this person.\u201d They have a lot of overlap, no doubt, but what I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m way more comfortable. I do get it. I get it that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD1\">when I\u2019m talking with someone that I somehow draw people and maybe I\u2019m really good at conversation or I\u2019m witty or I\u2019m a very interesting guy or whatever the fuck. I\u2019m charming.  I accept all that now and it feels good. I\u2019m saying that the other part is harder for me. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD2\">I get at a bar why a chick is really into talking to me and I know that part of that is that she\u2019s not going to talk to me if she wasn\u2019t also physically wanting to be near me, but that part I get less than the part that \u201cthis dude is really interesting and cool.\u201d Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">THERAPIST: \u201cGet less\u201d meaning you don\u2019t see it in yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">CLIENT: I see it less. I have less ownership of that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I totally own now the fact that, yeah, I\u2019m a pretty cool and very interesting guy and I\u2019m very lucky because that\u2019s something that builds even more confidence because I\u2019m like now I get why my older Assyrian friends are so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E11\">cool.  It doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t have hair or they have a big pot belly. They\u2019re just fucking cool. There is something attractive about that. Or Tony Soprano or those kinds of guys. They just own who they are. What I\u2019m saying is the part where a woman just wants to blow me in the car. That has <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E12\">something to do with my whole personality, but clearly \u2013 right? That part I\u2019m always in very happy surprise when that happens. Do you see what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I do. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on in each of these people\u2019s psyches, but it still feels a little like you\u2019re split up in not seeing yourself as a whole person, like they are all part one person.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">CLIENT: But those are different parts, right?  You go into a bar and someone hasn\u2019t even opened their mouths and you want to have sex with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">THERAPIST: But then they open your mouths and if you don\u2019t like who they are, they can suddenly become much less attractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, right. But, let\u2019s face it, a lot of time sex happens between people \u2013 you see it all the time in TV shows and movies, right? A girl is just fucking some very attractive dude and she keeps telling him to shut up because he\u2019s saying dumb . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a movie. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">CLIENT: I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying that doesn\u2019t happen, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s an extreme, but I\u2019m saying a lot of sex happens where you\u2019re like \u201cthe person is kind of . . . that\u2019s not going to go anywhere but, man, they were just so sexy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re not even talking about people who are saying they just want to have sex and be out of there, Brian. You were talking about people who were saying they were actually interested in a relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: So they\u2019re not just interested in you to have sex. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m saying both of them \u2013 that might be true, but the sex is definitely hyper-sexualized from the beginning. So whether they want to get serious or not, that\u2019s a very weird way \u2013 not weird. I\u2019m not . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I get that that\u2019s weird. I understand what you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: Unless I\u2019m wrong. Maybe that\u2019s how everyone is getting together these days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: No. No, no, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t think it is. All my friends go on dates and on the third or fourth date they have sex; or maybe on the first date they make out. I have more extreme situations oftentimes on my hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: We used to talk about were you hyper-sexualized with them. Does it feel like that\u2019s lessening? In other words, being seductive, being like \u201ccan I get this woman to want to have sex with me?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: Oh, is that less now? It kind of is because now it doesn\u2019t feel like a big deal. Now it feels like Jesus Christ. Listen, this Okay, Stupid thing? One of my friends \u2013 remember the one girl I said I like as a person? She is like this is hot to me and sexy. She\u2019s very fun and sexy and all that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">I would flirt with her and say things about her bringing a girlfriend with her and whatever. She is so fucking awesome that she was like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ll do that for you. You\u2019re moving and you\u2019ve never done that and I want to be part of that. I want to make that happen for you.\u201d That\u2019s not sleazy or <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201052\">weird to me. That\u2019s someone who I already know and we already have a history. She\u2019s a good person and she just likes sex like I do, but she\u2019s not a douche bag or a sleaze bag.  So on Okay, Stupid I made a profile, like a female bi looking for . . . It\u2019s so fascinating as a dude. I didn\u2019t say that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201053\">was a woman, I used her info but I\u2019m like it\u2019s me and her and whatever. Maybe that is what\u2019s happening now because there are all these totally professional, otherwise-together women who are like \u201cYep, I\u2019m into that.\u201d It\u2019s like what? I guess that\u2019s great, but I don\u2019t know if (chuckles) that\u2019s just what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201054\">happening now? I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. I think all of it is, again \u2013 I think you\u2019re right \u2013 it all goes back down to I just have trouble on some level being totally comfortable with the fact that I can have any of that or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562578\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">THERAPIST: Or what it is even about you. Like I wonder. We talked about your seeing her, talking about her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">CLIENT: Seeing her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">THERAPIST: In other words, whoever your with is really attending to her mind in the beginning for a long time even sort of yourself not really existing and making it look like you were talking about yourself but never really doing that, the recognition of being seen in another way. These are all kinds <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B1\">of big parts of you, things that you would do in a relationship that could be appealing to a person, but that I don\u2019t think has ever been seen by your parents, like recognizing that you\u2019re good at seeing people and people enjoy being seen. Or a poet is going to be incredibly sensitive and articulate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">CLIENT: Even little things, like a gentle ribbing that could mean nothing, but actually it means a lot to a young person. Like if your dad is like \u201cmy son is going to do great with the ladies; a musician, a poet,\u201d or whatever. But never. Nothing. Maybe he would have. Maybe we were getting to that point <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D1\">that maybe he would have seen it, because I also kept myself hidden. It\u2019s hard to say that about your kid if your kid is not out there playing rock and roll. In a way it was hard, I think, for him to even think \u201cdoes this kid even know any girls?\u201d Do you know what I mean? Because I always stayed in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D2\">my room. It\u2019s not like I had a rock band in the garage. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I do, but I also think it starts with knowing your kid when he\u2019s three, too, and being in awe of your child and thinking he\u2019s the next best thing to sliced bread because he\u2019s him; and then that gets internalized. And it doesn\u2019t sound like that happened. Next time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: 2:20? See you tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">THERAPIST: Bye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
