Or at least I haven\u2019t quite got yet. Wasn\u2019t clear about. One is . . . you feel like there is potential. It could be really good. Or there could really be something there.

Because it would involve, in a way, actually maybe more situations in which . . . you felt . . . like this. Not necessarily about the relationship as a whole, exactly, but . . . about feeling like you weren\u2019t getting through <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">to the other person and they were keeping you at arm\u2019s length where you had to make sense.
