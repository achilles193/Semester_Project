(inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: So I don\u2019t think I mentioned this last week. Did I talk at all about one of my cousins?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: No, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So one of my cousins, on my dad\u2019s side, my cousin Daniel (sp)\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know. He was in the hospital with like (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: He had an enlarged heart, he had pneumonia, he had like everything. Yeah, and he like, they kept him for like a couple weeks, which, given that he\u2019s poor and getting on Medicare, is pretty impressive. So that was like, yeah, you actually need to manage your diabetes as opposed to ignoring it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">et cetera, et cetera. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">His kidneys have now failed, or are failing, so he\u2019s starting dialysis and needs a kidney (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Is that also a consequence of diabetes that\u2019s not well managed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So he also did a lot of drugs and alcohol and other things, but I think in actuality, not managing his diabetes at all was the problem that is making his kidneys fail. He\u2019s always felt, he\u2019s been convinced for a long time that he\u2019s going to die by the time he\u2019s forty. He\u2019s thirty-nine, so he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">been like, well there\u2019s no point, because I\u2019m just going back and forth, (inaudible at ). So he hasn\u2019t been taking good care of himself, and like I thought that any other hospital was going to do, get him to manage his diabetes, but not really, or damage done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Does he have a trauma history?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Hm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Does he have a trauma history?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Like a traumatic event happening to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Sort of. I did ask because of like a (inaudible at ) T-shirt thing? Did you hear about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: A ton of people who have advanced trauma, not always, but sometimes have a like foreshortened sense of their future. They just don\u2019t, it can sort of manifest a few different ways, but they say that, like I\u2019m going to die young, would be consistent with that. Not that there aren\u2019t many of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">us that think that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so his parents fought a lot and like in and out of being married, and so for awhile he went to live with my, with our grandmother. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">I think he lived with her for about a year or so, and we now know he had ADHD, but at the time, you know, whatever. And I think he was five, but didn\u2019t know his like ABCs, and couldn\u2019t really read very well, so my grandmother was like all about budget, and she\u2019d retired at that point, so she\u2019d like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">sat him down at the table and was like you\u2019re going to learn things. And then she died kind of suddenly. I mean, you know, she was in her sixties, so it\u2019s not completely crazy, but I think she had just retired I think two years before that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">And had like a lot of plans that she wanted to do too. And when it happened, Daniel wasn\u2019t there, but he remembers coming in and like his mother and my aunt were just sobbing hysterically and freaking out. My grandmother refused to go to the hospital in an ambulance because she was scared of them, yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">she got driven, and she died. And I mean, Daniel definitely feels like his life would be completely changed in a better way if grandmother had lived, which is kind of true, in a way. When he was a teenager, he, his father\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t my father\u2019s, but his uncle on my cousin\u2019s father\u2019s side of the family <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">introduced him to cocaine and drinking a lot and doing a lot of dumb shit. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">And so he used to fight with his mother to the point of like he, he and his friends would like hide by her house and try to scare her when she walked in. He punched out her car window one time. Yes, and then I mean, he was in jail I think twice. So his mom died young. His mom died, actually I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">know. I don\u2019t know how old she was. Like I remember when it happened, but she was probably in her forties. And then he saw some things, and then he did a variety of things, including going to jail. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">So yes, his dad is also really fatalistic. Like, because if you ask him, yeah, he never really explains why he knows that he\u2019s going to die. He just kind of knows it. And I think he also feels like having done a shit ton of drugs, and like a serious alcoholic and a bunch of other things that I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">know, it\u2019s kind of like well it\u2019s too late now. So yeah, I was looking at my phone, because like I, for some reason I, (inaudible at ), I\u2019ve been kind of sucking it down, like talking about it, because it\u2019s very stressful. And then having two good friends with, you know, mothers with cancer is kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">of like at least it\u2019s not cancer, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">So what, but like Saturday or something I was like oh, I think the reason I\u2019ve been incredibly stressed and unable to sleep and just feel really horrible might be that. In fact, it\u2019s almost definitely that. So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You seem kind of (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s so, it\u2019s really frustrating that I really thought that last year he was going to, it seemed like he was going to like do things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">His girlfriend Marianne (sp), who\u2019s really amazing, they\u2019ve been together for quite awhile, she\u2019s really helped him like, I don\u2019t know, stay away from bad influences and try to, he has horrible anger management problems, just horrible. And she\u2019s been helping him like with that, and some other things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">and so she actually got him into the hospital by saying, I will break up with you and leave the house right now if you don\u2019t go. But it\u2019s definitely the week of back and forth thing. So I don\u2019t know, like I didn\u2019t realize that he hadn\u2019t whatever gotten off or done anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">And yeah, I mean it\u2019s like there\u2019s so many things like he has kind of trashed his body in various ways, but I do find it kind of overwhelming that not taking care, like not, the diabetes is probably, the cocaine does hurt, but the diabetes is probably the rest of him. And like I don\u2019t know. Like all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">the, like out of all the ridiculous things he\u2019s done in his life, I\u2019m kind of like diabetes? Wow. And\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Like there\u2019s something about his activity around managing the diabetes that is like matters more than anything else? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, because he\u2019s very, he\u2019s really hot-tempered, and he like tends to pursue things, I guess, vigorously for lack of a better word, like, so it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s just not doing anything. I mean, he, when he was in prison the last time, he got his GED, which, you know, is impressive. And apparently <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">he was the person that other prisoners went to if they were having math problems, which was, I had no idea. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">I hate math. But I mean, (inaudible at ) used to think about how, when one of his, one of his big regrets is that his mother died before he stopped being a horrible person towards her, so he never really got a chance to apologize. I mean, he did, like he apologized to other family members, like he had <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">like, been horrible to. And not surprisingly, so I guess it was whatever it is for drugs. He had done the, you know, step of asking for, or trying to make amends, asking for forgiveness, and (inaudible at ) for my Aunt Sam. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">And he was really angry because she said, you know, I forgive you, like I forgive you, but I\u2019m not going to forget that. And he could not, I don\u2019t, I mean, I think A, he didn\u2019t understand, like he didn\u2019t really seem to get what she was saying, and also, not surprising, he\u2019s like, \u201cBut I apologized.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">I\u2019m like yeah. And also like a lot of my dad\u2019s family is, so my grandmother and, my grandfather died, like at like sixty. He, I think he had a heart attack, and then my grandmother died. Aunt Vivienne died really young. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">Like I don\u2019t think she even hit forty. And then my Uncle Jim was the youngest of all of them, and he, you know, got cancer recently, and then my Aunt Sam was in the middle. But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I, kind of like, with the other, I don\u2019t know, like cancers have like, well it\u2019s out of the blue, like there\u2019s nothing that they could have done, really. And then my grandmother and grandfather, you know, they had bad health, but again, like a heart attack. Especially if you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">scared to be in an ambulance, like nothing\u2019s going to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">And actually, I don\u2019t really know why Vivienne died so young. We didn\u2019t really talk about it. Maybe my parents told me, but they just, so sometimes I wonder, like I know she had diabetes, I know she had high blood pressure like everyone in the family, and I don\u2019t like, I\u2019m like, did she have heart disease? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">Did she, was it diabetes-related? But I don\u2019t know. And like one of the things that\u2019s gotten me very stressed is so I offered to get tested to see about donating a kidney because I just totally would do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">But weight cutoffs are really common. And technically I\u2019m too fat to donate bone marrow, but I lied on the bone marrow registry because I was annoyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Lied about your weight, you mean? Or\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Well, I called and asked about the policy, and they\u2019re like well, they actually said if you\u2019re over this BMI, you\u2019re obviously not healthy enough to donate. And I was like well, but can I write you a doctor\u2019s note? They\u2019re like, \u201cNo.\u201d Like okay. I\u2019m like, so that concerns me. Having one kidney\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">not great either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">But also, I don\u2019t know, like I\u2019m worried that when I talked to him, you know, it\u2019s hard. Like I talked to him the day after he found out about the dialysis, and I talked to him again. Actually, I talked to his girlfriend like a week later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: How often do you generally talk to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t, like I talk to him a couple times a year. I just don\u2019t, I hate talking with him. And he\u2019s funny in that both he and his mother would, they love to ask questions, but never want to answer questions, so he\u2019s always asking questions about what I\u2019m doing, and my life, but if I ask and he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">like, \u201cThat\u2019s really personal.\u201d I\u2019m like oh, like including things like just everything, just like Daniel, if you\u2019re going to ask me twenty questions, I get to ask you twenty questions. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And did you hear back about donating a kidney, or you still haven\u2019t heard?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: So they\u2019re not at that, they\u2019re not at that stage yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: For a second, I\u2019m like, it sounds like probably mid-April, end of April the doctor will be able to say something useful about like how to get tested, where, I\u2019m assuming living in Manchester I could find someplace to do something, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Is he in Columbus?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: He\u2019s in Cincinnati.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Cincinnati, okay. Somewhere, conceptually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: And also, I\u2019m just like, yeah, he hasn\u2019t like use for, he doesn\u2019t have a lot of money, his girlfriend makes some money, but like he\u2019s going to have to go on disability. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">And he\u2019s frustrated that\u2019s not enough. He\u2019s going to have to deal with all the Medicare paperwork, Medicaid or whatever, which the hospital, fortunately, has some people on staff to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Which is good, because that stuff is hellacious. But it\u2019s one of those things where I\u2019m like being a black male in Cincinnati, or in Indiana is like, let\u2019s knock thirty years off your life expectancy, or put you in jail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Or both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Or both, yeah. And it\u2019s just, and like that\u2019s just, like there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. He doesn\u2019t want to move, and not like it would help, but like it\u2019s hard to just try thinking, like school to prison pipeline. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">Environmental reasons, everything, which aren\u2019t really, they don\u2019t know how I feel about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: No, I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t. (inaudible at )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, because that makes me feel fatalistic, just like well, you were kind of screwed from the start, but and also like, I don\u2019t know, I got caught up for a little while thinking about the logistics of how that would work, like would I have to go to Cincinnati for a month, do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">And I hate Cincinnati. It\u2019s kind of horrible in many ways. And my, so my dad and my Aunt Frances (sp) are the two siblings who like made it the most, I guess. And my brother and I have probably, (inaudible at ), one of my, one of my cousins Layla, she, I think she got a PhD. She may have just got a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">Masters. But it\u2019s always awkward being the like, why can\u2019t you be like Karen and Will? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">Because they know that, I confirm that like they\u2019re hard to (inaudible at ). I\u2019m just like, and for a long time, like Daniel, he\u2019s definitely expressed resentment. I don\u2019t know, kind of like, like towards my parents, towards that, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s like, \u201cWell you had it so easy.\u201d I mean, so his thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">is sort of, he feels like my brother and I, and then also my dad to an extent, like we had it easy, like our parents handed it to us, like you know, handed us whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">And it\u2019s not there because his parents weren\u2019t supportive, and at times he very much, he very much seems to feel like I don\u2019t know, like he was cheated out of something. I, like a better life, or something. I mean, he also like, he also blames his uncles and cousins who introduced him to like drugs <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">and alcohol. And then he also blames his mom, blames his dad sometimes. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s a pattern of blame?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: A lot of blaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019d have grievances, but (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he, it\u2019s one of those things where I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think, yeah your parents had some problems.\u201d But so when we were kids, his parents had a nicer house than my parents did, and his, I think his dad actually made possibly as much as, like a, salary comparable to my dad. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">worked for Pepsi, a regional sales manager, whatever, whatever. And his mom worked too, so like they had money, and various things happened. \u2018<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">You know, like I know that he was encouraged to go to school, but when he started terrorizing his mom, she didn\u2019t any more. I think like yeah, at some point she threw him out of the house because he was terrifying her. And so he went to live with his father. But it\u2019s also this weird thing where he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">like, he\u2019ll sometimes say like, \u201cWell you know, Karen, you and Will never had, like you\u2019ve never had any problems or any difficulties.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s true I\u2019ve never been in jail. I do not have three children accidentally, but certainly other horrible things have happened.\u201d And, like, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B2\">know like\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Sure, yeah, I can recall some of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s also sort of like an argument that I can\u2019t win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Right. But it actually feels like he\u2019s sort of working pretty hard there to defend himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: And you need a way of sort of externalizing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, part of the thing is like I do feel a certain amount of guilt or discomfort with like, yeah, I have succeeded like better than he has, but, you know, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s also a little unfair to me what he thinks are the things that make my parents, gave my brother and I. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">Because sometimes it seems like material goods, and sometimes it seems like he means emotional support or good parenting, and sometimes it just is unclear. Like I guess like sometimes it\u2019s kind of like, \u201cWell your parents are classy, and mine weren\u2019t,\u201d which I don\u2019t think is true, but yeah. It\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">really, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Like a lot of his life is incredibly sad, and unfortunate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, like he made a series of horrible decisions and for the last like, I don\u2019t know, eight, nine years like that, he\u2019s been doing a lot better, like the last time he was in prison he was like, \u201cWait, fuck this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Is that when he got his GED?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: So the second felony, and third felony you\u2019re in jail for like\u2014so he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in prison for\u2014\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: And the last time he was in prison, he also like asked for his family members to pay his child support for his daughter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">When he was in jail, because he couldn\u2019t. So yeah, like he started a sort of small business of like doing like yard, lawn work sort of things because he can\u2019t work, like it\u2019s really hard for him to work for a person, like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Taking (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Like taking orders, or he just woke up. He\u2019s no longer physically, like thankfully, he will no longer punch you, but he\u2019s just a really tall, big guy who will yell and get in your face, and might punch the wall. So I kind of see why people get freaked out. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">Like it\u2019s scary. And I kind of think that lately, he\u2019s been doing things that are really positive, like not doing drugs anymore. And he had a hard time, he was trying to sort of build a better relationship with his daughter. And actually, recently, his daughter\u2019s mother claimed that she never got any <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">child support when he was in jail, and sued him for the actual support, and Daniel (sp) was furious about it. And then my relatives said no one had thought to do like documentation of it, of giving her money. So she claims that she never received any of the money that she was given. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">And there was a problem with his daughter because he was so mad at his daughter\u2019s mother, and his daughter recently was like, \u201cLook, I know my mom lied. I know that you had people send her money when you were in jail. I get it. But you need to let it go so we can talk to each other.\u201d Good job, kid, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">by kid I mean eighteen. And he\u2019s going to go to her high school graduation, and she got straight As, and she\u2019s going to go to cosmetology school, which is great. He also has surprise twin sons, which the mother just didn\u2019t tell him. And so he\u2019s been trying to do something with them. So it\u2019s like you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF2\">know, good things, positive things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">Not drinking too much, whatever. And now I\u2019m like well, this really sucks. Like this is, I don\u2019t know, I guess it feels like now taking a turn towards tragedy again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I see, where it had been sort of like a change of trajectory towards more positive stuff, like he was on the way up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, like it really was like we had a (inaudible at ) long conversations about one of my other cousins had said that (inaudible at ), you know, it was like a waste, like he just wasted his life, whatever. And I was talking to Daniel, like I was actually proud of him for making all these changes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">and that he\u2019d gotten his GED was really amazing, because they\u2019re hard to get, and you know, so we had this type of long conversation where I was like, \u201cNo, like I\u2019m really proud of you. You have done such great things.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">And I don\u2019t want to be cheesy about it, but we\u2019re proud of you. So like I\u2019m still proud of him, but I\u2019m also like, \u201cOh my God, why aren\u2019t you taking care of your diabetes?\u201d You need a kidney transplant. Like it\u2019s a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: And, you know, I don\u2019t want to talk about to Jamie (sp) because she\u2019ll give me a medical consult and I don\u2019t want that. And I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just finding it hard to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really bothering you a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s just like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: My sense is like is it something because of what\u2019s happening to him? Sort of reflect in a depressing way about the world he lived in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and my other fear is that I won\u2019t be able to donate a kidney because of my weight, and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It probably doesn\u2019t make you feel any better about any of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Right, it\u2019s infuriating, and it\u2019s one of those things where I\u2019m like, would I attempt to voluntarily lose weight which I don\u2019t think would work for that purpose, and then like, like I don\u2019t know. It just brings up like that spectre of would you try to lose weight for medical reasons? And my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">basic answer is no. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Right. I imagine, maybe I\u2019m wrong, but that might be because you\u2019re angry and don\u2019t buy into why you have to in the first place, or is it different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s sort of a couple things. It\u2019s like most of the time what is happening is that for whoever\u2019s sake you need to lose weight is assuming that I\u2019m very sedentary, that I eat lots of fast food, that I eat, like I assume gross lean cuisine or I drink diet soda. Like they assume\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t really know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m like no\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Actually, you live quite a healthy way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and also like while these are like medical conditions that like are affected by weight, they\u2019re just like, \u201cLose weight.\u201d And also dieting almost always fails. It\u2019s one of those big depressing like 80 percent of people who diet gain it back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">And like to be really sort of blunt, like if I had to lose 50 pounds to donate a kidney, I wouldn\u2019t give a shit like if I gained it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: Like I don\u2019t care. But I actually don\u2019t know that it\u2019s, I could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Lose it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Which might not work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s like it just might not work, and it\u2019s, it\u2019s yeah, like I don\u2019t know. My father\u2019s sister is (inaudible at ), like off and on all their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m like, and just, you know, it\u2019s like weight loss doesn\u2019t, like it\u2019s really hard to lose weight, it\u2019s really hard to keep it off. I don\u2019t enjoy the things that you have to do to try to like drop weight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">Especially since they often don\u2019t do anything except make me cranky and miserable, and I don\u2019t like, like you know, much harsher things to say to myself than obsess over calorie counts. And, a coworker of mine, I just found out, which I think also ties into this, is, she just had weight loss surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Bariatric surgery?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, and she didn\u2019t really tell anyone, so this is a (inaudible at ) worker but who\u2019s overweight. She\u2019s fat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">She\u2019s probably fatter than me, like, and so anyway, there was a whole thing where no one told me that she was going out for surgery because everyone in their office space knew but even though I\u2019m not there a lot, no one\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like pisses me off, which also set me off into a tizzy. But the reason, the reason that she told me was pretty much because I\u2019m also fat. She\u2019s like, \u201cWell you know how,\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cYou know how it is,\u201d like I went to the doctor, and I don\u2019t want to have diabetes, I don\u2019t want to blah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F51\">blah, blah, so I decided to do this. And I\u2019m just like, like I didn\u2019t say anything negative. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">What the fuck?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, she just had it done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Well, and also, yeah, like she did it, she has control of her own body. It was like a new bariatric procedure was going, but she looks like a wreck because right now she can\u2019t really eat anything. So the way they mostly work, it\u2019s just horrifying, is so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Makes a like whole, like pulling the way out of your stomach so small that you can\u2019t eat very much, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: This particular kind basically kind of smushes half your stomach, or blocks it off or something. So you can only eat a very small amount of food, and you just start eating only a very small amount of very soft food. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">And then it\u2019s like you can start (inaudible at ) with crunches, and you have to be very aware of like nutritional content, because you are eating a half cup of food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">THERAPIST: Right, you could be malnourished, right, very easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: Yes, and so she looks exhausted, her skin was horrible. I mean, she looked sick and terrible. And that, and like she made that decision not because she\u2019s currently having medical problems, but because she\u2019s sort of bought into if you\u2019re fat, you\u2019re going to die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">CLIENT: There\u2019s this like sort of joke. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">I don\u2019t know if that acceptance, people have been trying friends where a lot of times someone will say like, \u201cThat woman was so fat, she was like 300 pounds,\u201d and that\u2019s the like 300 or that\u2019s like the sort of like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: And so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Flashing lights, cutoff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah, so one of my friends who\u2019s like, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m def that size.\u201d He\u2019s over 300 pounds. And so several people were just like, \u201cYep, I\u2019m def fatty. I\u2019m going to die of that right now.\u201d And I feel like my coworker kind of believed it. Like she doesn\u2019t, you know, she said, \u201cWell I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201131\">to have diabetes.\u201d And I\u2019m like, yes, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Right, so like similarly, really depressing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: About like the culture with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and like my concerns about being too fat to donate an organ combine with her doing like very edgy surgery.

It just makes me stressed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s hard to, so the way that one of the ways that dieting plays out (inaudible at ), especially never quits her social groups, is everyone talks about diets. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">And there\u2019s the newest diets and this or that, and everyone assumes you\u2019re on a diet, were just on a diet, or going to be on a diet. And\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: If not all three.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: If not all three of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah. At any moment, so that I find horrible and try to sort of cut off, and also (inaudible at ) people who are doing, it\u2019s like dieting thing, they\u2019re talking about, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t have that full, I can\u2019t have a whole donut, I can\u2019t just pig out on whatever.\u201d And usually I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, fuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201291\">you. I\u2019m going to whatever.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: And create opportunities too, like, you know like so many things, we\u2019re like, \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so hungry, I could eat half a sandwich.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And (inaudible at ). Like sometimes my reaction is to be like, \u201cFuck you. I\u2019m having the biggest salad in the universe.\u201d And sometimes I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck you, I\u2019m going to have a burger and fries,\u201d like you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">And like she\u2019s going to get, it\u2019s just like she looks so sick, she\u2019s going to get all this praise for losing weight, and bariatric surgery isn\u2019t even necessarily, because you, if you want, it is possible to sort of just re-stretch your stomach out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Or just not lose as much weight as you hoped, so you can have bariatric surgery and still be fat.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562398\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: Just not as fat. So there is that. And then I feel like well, but what if my weight was like the only thing keeping me from doing this? Would like, would like, someone, would people like judge me for not trying to diet? Like it\u2019s\u2014dieting is so expected and so assumed. Like that\u2019s what we want <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201371\">to do, and that it\u2019s just a thing you can do, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re lazy. I feel like if that was, if that was the thing, and I\u2019m like building it up, you know, think weight would be the only thing. But it makes me feel like it was a judgment of like why couldn\u2019t you lose, you know, like twenty pounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: To save someone\u2019s life, or whatever. And I\u2019m just like, \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that, and fuck.\u201d Like I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of an emotional minefield.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Amazingly, my mom did not get on me about being diabetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: I was really shocked. She actually was relatively calm, all things considered, especially considering that she\u2019d also had decided like five or six years ago that my dad was going to need to go on dialysis at any moment, which wasn\u2019t true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: We should stop. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">(inaudible at )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: Thank you.
