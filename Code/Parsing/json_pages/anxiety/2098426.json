Well, I'm glad you're here. I was nervous for a minute that maybe you weren't going to show up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I was kind of like (unclear) by the time I was like able to do that and I was like, \u2018well, I can be there in two minutes anyway (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well, that's okay. I mean I will wait for you, always. I thought, I know last week felt like a really intense session for me and I wonder if it felt that way for you and if maybe, you know I wondered if you were not showing up and maybe that was because last week was hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: No, I mean I wouldn't do that without actually canceling or something. Reasons for me not showing up are either being really, really sick or that one time there was a time change and I forgot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: No, no, you're always very good about usually coming to session or always canceling if you need to. Did last session feel hard for you or is that just on my end?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: It did feel hard for me but I guess because I had all these other things that were harder like it was not much in the scheme of things because that was last Monday and I had to wait until Thursday to get the prescription for meds and then I couldn't start trying it out until Friday and it took <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">a while for them to set in, so I was like going crazy like for all that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Sorry to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: But the meds seem to be working. I was a little bit suspicious because it's called Cypromine and when I was looking it up on the Internet after our session it mentioned that it was a tricyclical med like (unclear) norepinephrine and [certinine] (ph) and I was like, \u2018no, that's not going to work.' <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">But, I called her and she called me back and it turns out that the Internet is misleading and it really only works (unclear) epinephrine. And so far nothing bad has happened so I'm feeling a lot better, like there's still times I'm feeling like I want to die but they are a lot less intense and happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">a lot less often so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Well, that's an improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I wish for you that you didn't have any moments where you wished you were going to die or wanted to, but it certainly seems like having some relief from that is a step in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, well it's kind of like the other scary thing is if she hadn't told but I guess I would have figured it out when I was looking it up on the Internet, but you can overdose from this medicine. If you take too much it will be toxic and you can overdose which is not the case for most antidepressants <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">and maybe that's one of the reasons why it's like fallen out of favor among psychiatrists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you can't trust yourself to take the prescribed amount?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: The first few days it was like having my dreams because like you know he was on the other side of the bed and I would have had to get past him to get it and stuff, but he trusted me with it. And then today, well at first he couldn't find it. It must have fallen on the floor or something and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">then he found it and it was like, \u2018okay, fine, then give it to me.' Like, I'm not doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well, one thing you can do if you want to create rather than having somebody else be responsible for it can also create some barriers to make yourself more trustworthy, is split it up and keep it in separate places so that if you were to feel impulsive, you want to take more than you needed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">that would require going to separate places in your house, or separate bottles so that, what you're trying to do is to this date any time you've ever thought about harming yourself there's also been a voice saying, \u2018no, that's not what I really want to do. I might feel like this but I don't actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">want to make a plan and follow through on it.' So, I think for your purposes if you can just delay your impulsiveness, you're going to tap into that other part of your voice, or other part of your head that has that more, kind of practical, longer view than what you're feeling in the moment. So if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">wanted to separate your prescription out in a couple of different bottles then those are all steps you would have to take each time you could rethink whether or not this is something you really wanted to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: (Unclear) lot of bottles but right now this sort of did if for me because the pharmacy when I (unclear) get it filled they only were able to give me 12 pills out of the 120 and the rest of them I'm getting today after 4 p.m. I guess because it's a less commonly used drug now so, while I used <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">half of those 12 pills, but like you know, and it was enough to last me, but, I mean I still could have overdosed from them because like they're 25 my pills and like the common adult dosage is 100 to 200 mg and so that would have been 300 mg in there and also you sort of like after you get to a certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">point you have to take a blood test to see what the level is in your blood to regulate the amount, so (unclear) very good about taking the amount of drugs that I need to like in general, also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You've been very compliant with your meds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, it's all so complicated and just also afraid the more that I step it up the more likely that some seratonin effect is going to come in though nothing is happening yet, and like really the main side effect is like dry mouth which whatever I may have also been sick, so I've been needing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">to drink a lot anyway and take the numbing cough drops and I guess the other one is dizziness and I haven't really been feeling that so I am probably okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(Pause): [00:06:42 00:06:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: And I finally sent out a cover letter today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: For the first time in weeks. But it was really a long shot, so it wasn't like the world's best cover letter. It feels like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You got moving again. Doing something in that direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: What is the job?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: It's the cataloger at a museum. I actually went to that museum like a ton of times when I was a kid, like my grandparents would take me and stuff. We'd play on the big model (unclear) and stuff and so. (Unclear) It's not far out. I would need a car I'm sure but what a burden. It's like 15 to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">30 hours a week which would be perfect but then it's like a one year grant funded thing and like that's fun it's like a cataloging position that requires cataloging experience and I don't have cataloging experience; I have (unclear) experience and they're not the same thing so it was like trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">convince these people that -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: It's good enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's like the same thing and it's not, so like it wasn't the longest cover letter in the world and I'm like whatever, don't [sweat it] (ph) send it out, I'll give it to them and it was posted on the 14th so it's not even late [between that long] (ph) so but like I haven't really done <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">anything else that I want to apply to because all these things are like, \u2018work on Saturdays,' or \u2018volunteer, unpaid internship opportunity.' I'm not writing cover letters for a volunteer unpaid internship. I can get those without writing cover letters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: You have a volunteer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Yes. I mean, but when I want to volunteer somewhere I can probably do that without writing a cover letter as well. So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Even though this one's a long shot I'm glad to see that you felt well enough to write it and send it out. That's felt blocked for a number of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, like earlier in the week I like wasn't feeling much like it could really, I guess (unclear) Thursday me and Sydney both got sick and like he got really, really sick and I got a little sick which leads us to believe that it might have been the flu since I got a flu shot and he didn't and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">you know, fever and stuff and I didn't. But also because I woke up so early (unclear). Because we went to bed at 7 last night and so I woke up at 7 this morning you know even after having breakfast I was like okay, fine, I'll write this cover letter and I was going to write this cover letter then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">can go down and dye all the yarn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You used yarn as motivation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I used yarn as motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Good for you, Georgia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: But there's still a little procrastination in there because I was like, I use knitting as procrastination and then dyeing yarn since it's such a much more involved process as an actual reward. And then also my yarn did get featured in the newspaper for the holiday guide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Really? Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: \u2018Cause I like a person had written me and I wrote her back and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I didn't get my paper this Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I don't think it was this Sunday. I think it was Friday or something.

But, yeah, there are so few things to apply for now. Like also today since he, the guy from the temp agency hadn't called me at all last week so I called and left a message today.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: And like I guess it'll be a weekly calling and leaving a message or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: You can put it in your calendar as your \"to'do\" to keep on top of them if you don't hear from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: It just seems like you know with the holidays is so sparse because I was even looking at like, when I was looking at the job log last week I think it was after our session I actually did go and look and they hadn't updated it for the week and like the previous week there was like nothing that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">was local, paid and I wasn't even really qualified for, so it was kind of disheartening. I mean there were other sites I have looked at and need to look at and like this is just the easiest one to look at but like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad to hear that you've taken some steps. For a couple of weeks there you felt like you couldn't do anything and you've motivated yourself to write the cover letter, you called a temp agency. You followed up with them again. You dyed some yarn.

But it's just still disheartening. I'm still not that motivated and like, yeah, you wrote this one cover letter but now what and you know, still like not even sure who I should ask for a job. I don't know, I could one of my other friends actually posted <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">on Facebook and be like, \u2018hey, I'm looking for a job in like anything.'

I just don't know. Especially because most of the people on Facebook are my age and like living in the area or if they are they are also looking for jobs or something and like I don't even know if that did her any good. Like I didn't see if there were any responses. I mean she also <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">is like a licensed message therapist or something like has skills that I don't have and she was looking for like retail (unclear) type things, I guess because she I don't know if she living in Chicago or wants to live in Chicago but like she is licensed in like Maine and then she'd need the extra <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200912\">money to take more classes to get licensed in Chicago in order to start making money doing that in Chicago. So trying to find another job in the meantime. I just don't like doing things like that. It's not like I saw her posting and was like, \u2018oh, my God, that's the most obnoxious thing ever, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200913\">it's just like I don't know if I could do that.' Also, because my parents are on Facebook. I guess I could probably write one like limited if I like put the [basement] (ph) settings. I never actually really explored the privacy settings on Facebook because I just, as a rule, because my parents are on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200914\">Facebook before they started having privacy settings, I just made it a rule not to post anything that I wouldn't want my parents to see. So, I guess I could explore that and make it so my parents couldn't see it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: It brings up just the idea of networking which as you know is a difficult area for you. So that was one way that this particular person chose to kind of put the word out there and hit a broad group of people depending on -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: So she's also looking for a broad type of jobs like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: So is there a more tailored way that you could do something similar not necessarily the same, not posting to Facebook but is there something that you would -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Not really, not that I can think of that would like be useful like wherever people who would know things and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">(Pause): [00:16:30 00:16:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: That's really not going to like if I want to work in retail or something, I would maybe but I really, really don't. And if it's not going to pay enough for it to be worth it, I'd rather have the free time that I might be making $8.00 an hour which I think is reasonable. If it would be like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">working that much time, not in my field, not advancing at all or getting anything productive done, you know, for not enough money to live off of versus perhaps doing nothing but at least I'm not making myself miserable doing all this work and making no money for it. And I think retail is one of those <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D2\">more like it's a harder job for less pay and you have no down time and I guess I'm sort of traumatized by my experience working at my dad's hardware store and like never again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: What was so painful about working for your dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: He always gave me minimum wage which was like $6.00 an hour at the time for doing tons and tons and tons of work and my grandma was there and there was no down time at all. If you had some down time it was like \u2018oh, no, you can clean this thing,' or \u2018oh, you can do book work,' or \u2018you can do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">this or that.' No down time. She didn't believe in down time. Whereas, like you know, you might have a cushy office job where you're working for like making (unclear) I was getting $13 an hour and there was like a lunch hour or a lunch half hour and that was actually part of your work day, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A12\">You got paid for that. And you could, if there wasn't a project that you were doing and there weren't any projects, and I have a lot of projects, but if there was nothing going on or if I was like specifically waiting on someone to do something, and you know they told me to wait, I actually had down <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A13\">time and I could like socialize with people and stuff. And so it was sort of like the direct opposite of retail. And the work was also a somewhat intellectually challenging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Well, it's the direct opposite of retail with your grandmother in charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: With my grandma in charge. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: So I wonder it sounds like part of your traumatizing experience of working there is not just that it was retail, but that it was, it's something there's the difficult dynamic with your grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: It wasn't difficult. Like it was a lot more difficult to be a cashier than it would be to say be in the Gap because you have special orders and contractor accounts and all sorts of crazy things that you wouldn't have at a clothing store or anything else store really, so yeah, it was like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it was just a bad work experience for you to work in your family's shop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Like the customers were usually nice and that was fun, it was just my grandmother was just a pain in the butt and like when my mom started working for the hardware store like, well I guess it would have been almost like a year and a half ago now, she would like say, \u2018oh, all those times you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">complained about how hard it was to work with grandma, blah, blah, blah, blah, you were right and I'm sorry.' I was like, \u2018okay, see. Yes, it was that bad.' She thought I was blowing it out of proportion, but no.'

Like, I don't want to do food service either because it's like the (unclear) is actually hiring and I'm like, \u2018hmm, I wonder what kind of experience that would be? I'm like, I just don't think I would be coordinated enough to scoop the ice cream without breaking the cone or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">and would probably eat way to much ice cream and so I don't know. Maybe working in some small, some other sort of shop wouldn't really suck so much, but I'm still sort of traumatized by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">(Pause): [00:21:21 00:21:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: It seems like you're more likely to take action if you focus your efforts on library related stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Even if it's not directly archivist jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You're more motivated to really stay in your field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Also because like they would be more likely to give me an interview anyway. I'm having enough trouble with like the admin assistant jobs and I think of whoever is qualified for those, how much more over qualified would they think I'd be for like working in an ice cream store or something. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">extremely over qualified. And so I wouldn't get those jobs either. Maybe if I came in with a resume or something then I don't actually like I don't even put it on my resume any more because it was from like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So long ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: So long ago. Yeah. It was like 10 years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">(Pause): [00:22:20 00:22:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: So I don't even have the relevant experience, I just have all these degrees that would make me cost more money. And then again everyone in the area has all these degrees that would make them cost more money and someone has to work retail so I guess that's not a complete argument against, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">it just, yeah, doesn't seem like it would work. And I'd be fine doing admin work in like some sort of place somewhere around here, just don't want to work retail. I mean, with the exception of a yarn store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Are you looking into those?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: No, because they aren't hiring right now. I mean I like tried that before and like they weren't hiring when I was looking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: When was the last time you checked back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: A long time ago. So maybe they'd be hiring now, but like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Especially maybe part temporary and holiday season?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, though they require Saturdays and that would be a problem, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It is pretty late in the holiday season now, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that would probably require going all the way out there and looking or calling them or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: But that may be like one phone call. I'm thinking about what would be your equivalent of sort of a general shout out to people that you're looking for work, maybe putting on your list something reasonable and manageable like calling one yarn store, asking if they're hiring. If they say no, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">asking one question. \u2018Hey, do you know of any other similar stores in the area that may be hiring?' That could be sort of a nonconventional networking phone call for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">(Pause): [00:24:33 00:24:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah but would they send someone to their competition? And I guess it's less (unclear) than like some other industries, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I don't know. I mean the existence of the store is there sometimes people are actually collaborative rather than competitive. Stores actually make more money when there are more stores near them because you draw a bigger crowd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah I guess it is a bigger place for yarn stores so people would go to the city and go to all the yarn stores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">THERAPIST: You know and some places are more of a community of you know, where all the people really into crafting but either you don't end up in a worse position and you may not get a great lead out of it, but for the effort that you would have to put out to make that first phone call, it's certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">not going to harm you in any way and it sounds like one of the things in the past that we've talked about sending somebody an e-mail, a professor an e-mail asking a friend, or putting it on Facebook. One of the things you're worried about is well what would they think if I'm asking? But if you call <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E72\">a store that you frequent and you know, but they don't really know you that personally, there's much less chance of feeling judged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Especially if I don't give them my name in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it prevents it takes down that barrier that seemed to have existed for you in terms of networking, just kind of a fear that someone is going to think badly of you for asking. So it takes away that piece of it, but it could get you a lead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. At this point after being unemployed for a year I mean (unclear) kind of scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: I think I'm really sick of being unemployed or under employed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I can imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: I'm like, they seem really enthusiastic at the temp agency but I haven't -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You haven't heard anything back yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: So are you sick enough of being unemployed to push yourself to do some of these uncomfortable things in the hopes of it leading somewhere?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: I don't know how much of a the risk versus the possible, the probable reward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: So I think in something like doing a cold call like this the probability of reward is pretty low. I don't think zero, but I think it's pretty low. But I also think the risk is really low. It's not having to craft the perfect cover letter. It's not any sense of any public display of neediness. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">To me it seems like a very low risk with some potential reward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">(Pause): [00:27:31 00:27:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: This is really hard to deal with and I have just a tiny little bit of motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and I want to capitalize on that tiny bit of motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: And it's also like you know I might be going to Kentucky soon and oh, I guess -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: In theory, Sydney and I are going to Kentucky to meet his family for Christmas but it's sort of up in the air because he's sick and because he's kind of annoyed at them.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2010A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Oh.

Like we leave on a Thursday and come back on a Wednesday. Which is really fine because yeah, you've got this friend feature oh, wait, what if they're going to want to buy things from you for Christmas? Do I close <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201131\">the store? Do I like bring a certain percentage of the stuff with me and only keep those things online or do I like put in giant bold letters, \u2018if you buy this you will not get it until after Christmas because I am away, but please buy from me'. And so not going with (unclear)  but yeah -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: The majority of Christmas orders hopefully will be in before next Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Well, this is Thursday. The thing is though like if they true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk) last minute orders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: It's hard to get last minute orders. Usually if you're getting, doing last minute if you're a crafter you're knitting last minute. You're not (unclear) late minute. I would have to put it in front of every single piece that I have in the store so that, and then when they buy it I would also <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">have to (unclear) it there because they just don't like getting it in a couple of days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Not getting it in a couple of days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't want late customers but yet again I'm like, but there was the person who bought $135 worth of yarn. Maybe if people just buy everything in the next like three days then I won't have to deal with it at all, so that's not going to happen. Yeah, and I'm also apprehensive about this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">trip because Sydney doesn't have the best relationship with his parents. In terms of like his, like because we were thinking of staying in a hotel for like (unclear) and then when he was calling his mom and was going to tell her that she opened up the conversation with, \u2018oh, like you're cousin (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F2\">is so glad you're coming and they get to stay near you,' and like after that he couldn't like say -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk) you made that assumption pretty clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: So I was kind of like well you could call your cousin and be like, \u2018hey, we can all stay in the hotel.' But the problem is they're like I would actually be staying in the same room with him because like one of the reasons we were looking into the hotel was the whole if I am this crazy and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">distress with like medications and panic and stuff I do not want to be sleeping in a room by myself. So I would be sleeping in his room, however, I would be sleeping on his bed and he would be sleeping on an air mattress. His mattress, his regular mattress is like at least 10 years old, probably a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201232\">older than that. It is like one (unclear), it is broken. It's not just hard. It like hurts your back and he's been trying to convince his parents to like to replace it for like years and like they've put other guests on it and like when he told them he was like \u2018you really should look into it,' and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201233\">they sort of like laughed at him with disbelief like it's a crazy luxury item or something of having a mattress that doesn't attack your back so I was like well if I'm sleeping there, you know what, you're because also his parents don't deal well with like complaining, and so, they're like, \u2018when <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201234\">so and so stayed on the mattress they didn't complain,' and it was like because they were a guest, not because the mattress was comfortable. So it's like well you're thinking of getting your dad a more expensive Christmas present than that anyway, even like a $200 mattress because it's a twin bed, is <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201235\">still going to be better than whatever you have. Find something (unclear) and that will be their Christmas present and you are giving it to them and that's it. That is like the only way it will work because arguing with them isn't going to get you anywhere. So I guess he was talking with his therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201236\">about whether or not he should go down, but now we have the since he called them today to tell them that he was sick, we have that as an out because they don't want us if we're sick because I guess they have more (unclear) then my parents do. When I was sick my parents were like, \u2018oh, yes, come down <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201237\">for Thanksgiving.' So after I hung up I went to the emergency room (unclear) whatever. Not like Sydney's parents who don't want us getting people sick which actually makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20122-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20122-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: Travel experience as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: The whole airplane thing.

I'm just going to hide in the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I hope it does work out the way you want it and I keep remembering that part of the reason you're fearful is because you're panic\/anxiety has been so bad, but you did notice that for the past few days it's been getting better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: Hoping you can continue in that path would make the trip a lot easier if you end up going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I could pretend to be a normal, say, not panicking person long enough as long as I have somewhere to return to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">(Pause): [00:34:22 00:34:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">THERAPIST: Sometimes the distraction of having to perform whether it to prepare for something else actually does help you to set panic aside. Sometimes this gives you a focus. So we'll see what happens with what you guys end up deciding how you cope with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: Yeah. If I hadn't gotten the feature then it wouldn't have been a big deal to close my store for like a week and now I'm like I don't want to close my store for a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: It's nice to take advantage of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">CLIENT: Like the interest. (Unclear) like if I put it everywhere, like where the people but then again I guess I'm worried about people who can't read, but like in theory any normal person would be able to see it because it would be like the person would see like, \u2018items will not ship until after x-date.' <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2013C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098426\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and that's a common disclosure in thinking about when people can expect to get stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean but I feel like wouldn't people normally close the store if they were going to have that much of a delay, like it's a week's delay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">(Pause): [00:35:32 00:35:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">CLIENT: Then again there are people who like buy things that it takes you know I've bought things where it takes longer than that to ship and they don't have any sort of delay. That's just how they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">THERAPIST: Well, these are decisions that you are capable of making once you figure out whether you're going or not. You can think it through and choose what's best for your store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Should keep a session on the books for next week or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">CLIENT: I guess, I mean I'll know by Thursday whether or not I'm going, but I could let you know on Thursday whether, if I'm canceling and if I don't let you know assume it's still on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Let's, if you can, move it to earlier in the day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">CLIENT: Oh, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">THERAPIST: On Monday. (Unclear) lots of people are away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">CLIENT: I guess, yeah, it's Christmas Eve. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">THERAPIST: Could we do like an 11:30 or 12?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">THERAPIST: We'll just put it on my calendar. So let's plan for 11:30 and then obviously if you're not going to be here just give me a call. Give me a call Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">CLIENT: By the way, did you hear back from the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Everything's been sent off. I haven't heard anything back yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">THERAPIST: It often does take weeks and weeks and weeks for insurance to process things. Sometimes it's really sometimes you hear back within a week, sometimes six weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">THERAPIST: So this is not unusual. I have sent in all your billing and I sent in your referral form with it.

(Unclear) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">THERAPIST: Then I'll, yeah, if they don't cover something, I'll just send you another, I'll include it in the next bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
