I\u2019m very upset. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: [Why are you] (ph) upset? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: (Pause) (inaudible at 00:02:10) like me. I guess I want it in a certain way. (Pause) And that\u2019s a very upsetting thing to want because sometimes it seems like I\u2019m getting it and then it\u2019s very hard to not want it more. (Pause) And then when I\u2019m not getting it, it\u2019s very hard to focus on anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">else.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I can\u2019t seem to let it go. I also can\u2019t seem to settle in to how bad it feels because (ph) I don\u2019t want to smell my own s*** or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And sometimes I hate you for making me feel this way. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">Why did you take so long to reply to my last e-mail? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: (Pause) Well, I\u2019m not going to answer that, but I\u2019m sorry I should have responded sooner. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Thanks. Yeah. You should have. There\u2019s no need for me to like go through the compulsive e-mail checking. Ever. Especially not now. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You sound pretty pissed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s important. (Pause) So sad to be compartmentalized, but I can\u2019t compartmentalize you. Or [let go for a little while and I can\u2019t let go of you] (ph).  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: So I (inaudible at 00:19:25) to putting you through the compulsive e-mail checking thing at a time when I could and should have known already that you were having a hard time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:20:14) to you that it feels like I have to struggle (Pause) It occurred to me that I didn\u2019t ask anything from you and that maybe you weren\u2019t sure what to say. I think that\u2019s okay to communicate to me. (Pause) What\u2019s upsetting is that it upsets me. What\u2019s also upsetting is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">it upsets me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think I\u2019m pretty (inaudible at 00:22:03) Your being upset by how upset you are now. You can\u2019t be more easy about this. But it also (pause) \u2013because I think at some level it builds like a kind of (inaudible at 00:22:35) questionable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Well, first it felt like a desperate clinging to the way that you want the relationship to be or like, sort of putting me in my place. Like at first in the long two days. (Pause) And then it changed to like, \u201cMaybe you just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d And then it changed to like, \u201cMaybe you were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">busy.\u201d And you\u2019ll get to it when you get to it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I don\u2019t know if any of those (inaudible 00:24:13). Like maybe they all are, but I don\u2019t want to make you feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, you have a pretty broad range of reactions, I think. (Pause) And the first one, you\u2019re upset that things aren\u2019t the way you want them to be between us, which in a way I imagine us we\u2019re not on the same page, we\u2019re not in this together in a way it feels we should be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">And then the second one, I guess (inaudible at 00:26:15) me kind of cruelly showing you how things are or at least hopefully (ph) what they\u2014cruelly really. Putting you in your place, that\u2019s a cruel thing to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">And then third one, and my first thought is that you\u2019re rescuing me a little bit<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Well, sometimes you don\u2019t know what to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t like the way I imagine it might make you feel. If I only thought the first two \u2013 I don\u2019t like the way it makes me feel. Maybe I\u2019m not feeling\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562312\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I don\u2019t think (inaudible at 00:27:34) how we see that. I think you rescuing me is as much for your sake as it is for mine. You don\u2019t want to be in this with somebody who\u2019d do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t. (Pause) Sometimes I\u2019m not sure I want to be in this with (pause) any of the ways it is except for the way that I want it to be. (Pause) Even if you are compassionate and kind.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">You know? (Pause) It\u2019s upsetting because [I feel like they\u2019re not here] (ph) for me unless I get (pause) the specific kind of display of love that I want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I think maybe it\u2019s a little different. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but (inaudible at 00:33:11) that there\u2019s not enough here, but that what\u2019s here is overshadowed by how painful and maybe anxious it is when it\u2019s not the way you want. But it feels like nothing can make up for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think there\u2019s been very little settling into\u2014it\u2019s not how I want it to be and nothing can make up for that. There\u2019s a lot of like, \u201cHow could I (inaudible at 00:34:30) equally painful, I think, and anxious but energy (inaudible at 00:34:36) a little bit of a different kind of energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">It feels like an endless, like a perpetual spinning (inaudible at 00:34:52) whereas the other one feels (pause) like something that could pass. Like whether I decide that it\u2019s too painful and it passes that way and I leave or it passes and I stay. So emotion oriented with relating to it is\u2014it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">leave any room for\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Sort of anti-settling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. Unsettling. Anti-settling. Yeah, like it keeps me from settling or it feels like it keeps me from growing or (inaudible at 00:36:13) or growing with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like it takes up too much energy and it\u2019s too\u2026 yeah. On Thursday I think I realized that mostly what I felt in all the things I felt. Then you shared with me what you did is like really really strong clinging to it and like fear that\u2014and like weird pressure that I need to react in such <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">a way that you would do it again. [Or I feel that] (ph) fear that I wouldn\u2019t react the right way and that you would retreat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I see.
