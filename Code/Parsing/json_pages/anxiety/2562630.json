[Pauses] I didn\u2019t have too much of downtime, which was good. [Chuckles] But, yeah, I guess the question of [inaudible at 00:02:29] feeling entitled with complete strangers or people I don\u2019t know so well, and then not feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">entitled with people I know very well. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. [Chuckles] I guess I should think about that. [Clears throat] [Pauses] It is not that I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I could say that, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t take anyone for granted.\u201d [Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I don\u2019t think that is true, or maybe that is not even related. But isn\u2019t \u2013 doesn\u2019t that mean that you expect things from people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: That you expect\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: If you take people for granted, doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019ve been \u2013 you expect things? Or is that, again, another extreme? [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I guess. I always think of taking for granted as not being appreciative of what you\u2019re given, and so maybe that means that you\u2019re expecting things and not appreciating them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: [Chuckles] Or feeling entitled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yes, so that is what I mean. It is not like I don\u2019t feel entitled with respect to my mom, and I definitely take her for granted many times. But maybe that is not the way I should [ph]. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">We were talking about [pauses] \u2013 what does it \u2013 what does that look like, like feeling entitled in a healthy way, from someone with respect to someone you\u2019re close with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Hm, that is a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Mm. [Sighs] [Pauses for 25 seconds] It is like I said, I feel like I do both. I both kind of take people for granted and push them away at the same time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">Well, not at the same time but you kind of \u2013 so maybe that \u2013 those two behaviors are like extremes in some form, like vis-\u00e0-vis each other but also in their own kind of spectrum of behaviors. I don\u2019t know. [Pauses for nine seconds] Right now, I\u2019m not getting in touch with Nelson and [pauses] \u2013 so I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">visited Ohio last \u2013 this past weekend, and he was working all the time, like \u2013 well, I shouldn\u2019t say that. But, actually, he did all day Saturday and Sunday, and I got into Ohio at ten on Friday, and \u2013 Thursday, he [chuckles] \u2013 I had to wait for him to come back home, which is, I guess, OK. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">And I was waiting outside the building for like an hour. But \u2013 and, yeah, Friday, also, he got back after nine, and we didn\u2019t go out for dinner and stuff. But \u2013 but, yeah, all day Saturday and Sunday, he was working, and I tried to work, too. And then I came back and [chuckles] I kind of saw Chris [ph], <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">and he told me he\u2019d paid my mom\u2019s rent. [Chuckles] So [pauses] \u2013 and then I didn\u2019t hear back from Nelson on Monday, and I was like, \u201cSee? What is this? He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Even Graham wouldn\u2019t been like, \u201cHey, you got back OK?\u201d [Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">And then, on Tuesday, Nelson was texting, \u201cI\u2019m coming back tomorrow. Yea! Let\u2019s party!\u201d [Chuckles] I was just like \u2013 I was trying to be all songbird like \u2013 mm-mm\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562630\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You were mad at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: You were mad at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, mad but \u2013 no, but not really mad. [Pauses] Well, maybe a little mad, but I feel like I don\u2019t even have the right to be mad or I\u2019m not giving myself the right to be mad. It is like, \u201cSee? This is what I expected from him,\u201d or telling myself not to expect anything and [pauses] to [sighs] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">lower my expectations in terms of caring and stuff. [Pauses] And [pauses] comparing him to Chris and also comparing him to my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: [Pauses] And, yeah, yesterday, he \u2013 he was texting and calling, \u201cCan I pick you up?\u201d and this and that, and I was like, \u201cNo, I have work.\u201d [Chuckles] So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you were mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: [Chuckles] I guess, but I\u2019m in a weird situation where I\u2019m looking at Chris and feeling all these emotions, like guilt and love. And he has sprained his back, so I feel not pity but like I want to take care of him, and all these motherly feelings, as well. So [pauses] it is like still in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">confused [chuckles] state between these two guys. But [pauses] I don\u2019t want to be [pauses] keeping peop \u2013 them in the dark anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">But I don\u2019t know. So [pauses] I guess I was trying to understand but not really trying to understand the state of married [ph] how I\u2019d feel about people who I\u2019m intimate with, if I expect things or not. [Pauses] We I don\u2019t know. Earlier when I was living with Chris, he and I would help my mom with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">her rent. I would pay a portion, and then he would pay a portion. He paid the bigger portion and then we switched, and I\u2019d pay the bigger and he\u2019d pay the smaller. And then, when I moved out, over the summer, my mom \u2013 she used up her savings and paid all the things herself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">[Sighs] And then Chris stopped, and then he started again and he has paid a couple of times. So it is a weird situation, so I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t really expect help \u2013 financial help from him; although, he is helping. This month, he has helped, so [pauses] I don\u2019t at all feel entitled to his money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">And [pauses] \u2013 yeah, it is all \u2013 it is all very complicated in the sense that I guess I \u2013 I mean, I did help him when he was finishing his Ph.D. and he wasn\u2019t paying rent or whatever. And we had a huge fight and all that, and it was ugly, and I realized that I was very ugly that moment, like the lowest <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">kind of [chuckles] performance by me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">It was pretty bad with me to be that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Be what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: No, I just kind of brought it up and I was like, \u201cHow could you ?\u201d and like, \u201cHow could you take advantage of me like this? And I was struggling, and I had a dream, and you crushed it,\u201d [chuckles] like really feeling victimized, like two years ago, three years ago. I regret feeling that way <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">and saying \u2013 I regret saying those things to him. And \u2013 but, yeah, so I guess I could say that, yeah, there is this kind of thing where I helped him, so friends do that for each other. But I really don\u2019t feel like \u2013 feel entitled taking money from Chris. And sim \u2013 I think, similar, with Nelson, also, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">it really \u2013 he buys me things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">Last weekend or two weekends ago, we went shopping, and [pauses] [sighs] we just bought a couple of things and, at the counter, [chuckles] he was like \u2013 he is really into discounts, like, he won\u2019t buy anything full price. So I was getting a student discount on these things, and so I pulled out my student <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">ID, and the girl looked at it and said, \u201cOK, ten percent off.\u201d [Chuckles] And then, when the time came to pay, Nelson pulled out his credit card, and these two women at the counter \u2013 I feel now it is my manner [ph] that I\u2019m attaching to their look, but I felt like they were looking at me like, \u201cYeah,\u201d like\u2026 [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562630\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: \u201cYeah \u2013\u201d what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Well, you know, like\u2026 [pauses] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">I \u2013 what is that internal [ph] called? Like [pauses] [chuckles] I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t look married. We didn\u2019t look like we were in a legitimate relationship. It looked transactional and all that, like I was being paid this way for certain services [chuckles] which I actually don\u2019t even perform, so\u2026 [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Hm, like you were a prostitute or some\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: You were keeping him company and getting some reimbursement for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I have the \u2013 I have the Pretty Woman flashbacks a lot. [Chuckles] Not flashbacks but like flashes a lot of times with Nelson. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: They didn\u2019t have sex, either \u2013 right? \u2013 or they did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: In Pretty Woman? Yeah, she was a prostitute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, she was, but I don\u2019t think they actually had sex. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: No, in the story they did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Did? Oh, you mean the film or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, in the film, they did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Oh. It has been a while since I saw that, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: You know, she is a prostitute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: No, she was! I don\u2019t know, but I felt like maybe that was what was different about their relationship. What was different was Richard Gere does fall in love with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t think it was sex, but I\u2019m pretty sure they had sex. I\u2019ll rewatch the movie but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Oh, [pauses] yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think they were kissing. I think that was something that she \u2013 if I\u2019m remembering this correctly, kissing was very intimate, and so she didn\u2019t kiss her clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Oh, OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: There was something about him that that was intimacy. But I think they were having sex. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Oh, OK. [Pauses] They\u2019re just attached by innocent kind of \u2013 maybe, also in their morals. [Chuckles] But the thing that, \u201cShe is a prostitute, but \u2013 and this really rich and handsome [chuckles] businessman just needs companionship.\u201d [Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well, there is a way I think that that movie tried to sanitize their relationship, too, in a way. They tried to make it look very pretty and not as grungy as \u2013 and grimy as it can be. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] And so she goes shopping on her own. Right? She doesn\u2019t \u2013 there is that scene, I think, like she is on Sunset Boulevard or something with his credit card, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I imagine, probably, not hers. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Well, but she\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: \u2026Buys stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Or the sales people just gave her hell or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Right. Well, because, when she first walks in and she looks like a streetwalker, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: \u2026She looks disrespectful, unrespectable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] But, yeah, I don\u2019t think I have anything like that, that can make me look disrespectable.

But, anyway, particular sort of roles that women play in your mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">And so there is the forsaken wife, like your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Hm\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: And then there is sort of the unrespectable mistress other, like the women that your dad was involved with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Hm\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And it is like there are sort of these particular archetypes that you, then, sort of gravitate toward\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Hm\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: \u2026Or associate to, maybe.

But it is not just my interpretation. One time, I was telling Chris about Nelson, and he was like, \u201cAh! So you\u2019re like the trophy girlfriend.\u201d [Chuckles] I was like, \u201cWhat? [Chuckles] What does that even mean?\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that pretty to be like a trophy girlfriend <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">or wife, but I do think of that \u2013 this relationship like \u2013 subconsciously, like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">Since he makes money, he is like this corporate guy, and I\u2019m the corporate wife who is bored and is yawning, or she is decked out in jewels. But then she is going to have an affair [chuckles] when the gentleman who has left her. You know, [pauses] but\u2026 [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I think that these are absolutely images you project onto these situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] No, but then that \u2013 sure, we all think of ourselves in these roles to some extent. But I do go back to my own work, and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, this is who I am. I\u2019m a student. I\u2019m a writer. I\u2019m a struggling writer. I have a mom,\u201d and this and that, \u201cand I have responsibilities, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">this is who I am, that is who I am.\u201d So I do try and \u2013 what you\u2019d say \u2013 try to find an anchor independent of everyone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">But then, I guess when it comes to [pauses] \u2013 relationships are not even relationships. It is just like other people come into the picture, and certain things happen, certain interactions happen. And in trying to understand them or trying to not get disappointed, I guess, I take the help of these various <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">roles to understand what is happening or contain my disappointment. It is a bit weird to have him pay for my things, and it is a bit weird to have Chris pay my mom\u2019s rent. How do I deal [chuckles] with this? How do I not feel utterly hopeless?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: About\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Taking financial help from these guys. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: And what is \u201chopeless\u201d about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Well, I feel pretty bad, [chuckles] like I can\u2019t take care of my own stuff. I mean, I could but they\u2019re doing it for me. And I\u2019m like that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not going to have to spend my own money, so [pauses] [chuckles] [pauses for five seconds] \u2013 I mean, yeah, I do say \u2013 I did say to Chris, \u201cI <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">will pay you back.\u201d Yes, if I do end up finding a full-time job, that would be \u2013 that can happen soon. But how do you pay \u2013 how do I pay Nelson back for all these gifts? I guess I\u2019ll have to give him gifts.

You don\u2019t take them out of a feeling of, \u201cHe wants to give me something as his girlfriend or somebody who is important to him, and I appreciate the gesture and the meaning.\u201d To you, it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">like he is giving this to you because your relationship is transactional, and you feel like, \u201cGreat, I need some money. This is awesome. I [chuckles] \u2013 \u201c \u2013 not, \u201cI care about Nelson and I appreciate the gift he is giving.\u201d So it is \u2013 there is a meaning attached, that you project onto him, that you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That you do feel it to be a matter of convenience.

A whore who doesn\u2019t have actual [chuckles] sex but [pauses]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m looking at [ph] the irony of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] No, [pauses] what was I going to say? But, yeah, I do feel the positive feelings that I care about him, too, and now I want to do nice things for him. But those translate into me cooking for him and nothing involving money, because, right now, I don\u2019t have money. There are moments <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">with Chris where I would spend money on him. And now, with Nelson, I\u2019m always asking, \u201cCan I cook? Can I cook? Don\u2019t eat out. It is unhealthy. I can make the exact same thing at home. Let me do this.\u201d So he is like, \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">But \u2013 so I feel like he doesn\u2019t even understand; or maybe he does, but he just has different values, and he knows the value of money more than the value of a nice gesture of a home-cooked meal. [Pauses] Which could be true, to some extent, that you think this is something I\u2019m projecting on him. It may <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB1\">be partly so, but [pauses for six seconds] \u2013 but I guess, to your earlier point, thinking transactionally, I guess, perhaps gets in the way of me [sighs] feeling entitled with people I know very well, so in a way, then, I seek it out elsewhere.

No, I see that, because she is very independent, and she likes \u2013 she doesn\u2019t appreciate being treated this way, that she owes anyone anything. She does have a sense of self-respect. So I \u2013 to the extent that she won\u2019t make certain compromises that a lot of people would, maybe not people <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">her age but\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">I wanted her to live with this other friend of hers. That would have brought both their rents down by 50 percent, definitely my mom\u2019s. But, no, she is like, \u201cThat woman kind of \u2013 I like her and I can spend maybe three to four hours with her but no more. She dominates in the kitchen. She talks a lot, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">and she\u2019ll drive me crazy. I\u2019m not sharing an apartment with her.\u201d So she does have that sense of, \u201cThis is my space, and I want to own this. This is my kitchen.\u201d And I can come in and kind of criticize it, and use it, and clean it up for her. That is fine. But there are certain domains where she demands <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F92\">ownership and respect, so it is, I think, hard for her to \u2013 to find herself, as a parent, being in this situation of taking instead of giving. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">But, after a while, it\u2019ll come to this.

But, [sighs] yeah, I guess the dynamics are just [pauses] \u2013 it is just the way it is right now because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">of tight finances for everyone \u2013 well, for her and me. But she does kind of have a way to rationalize. Like, when she paid her own rent last month, she was like, \u201cYeah, it is only this much more money, because I\u2019ve already paid security deposit and last month\u2019s rent, so it is just this\u2026\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">So she was trying to rationalize it.

So it could be in terms of money; it could be in terms of status, just like the cheaper person could be the person who makes less money or could be the person who has less education\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: \u2026Or I don\u2019t know what.
