I\u2019m tired of it. (pause) But I\u2019m feeling pretty bad about myself (ph), not very hopeful, not very secure. But here we are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">James is grumpy this morning because basically nobody in the streets where we park shovel their spaces. And so he\u2019s just like, he\u2019s just been doing a lot of shoveling, and I have to some degree. But also, he\u2019ll get out and shovel several spaces at once, with the hope that maybe we\u2019ll fit into one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">them. Saw one person had a traffic cone. I explained to him what that meant, and he didn\u2019t like it very much. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(pause 01:46 \u2013 02:03)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">We went through a rough time on Saturday night. We usually go over to Franco\u2019s (sp?), and [have some pizza and play some games] (ph). You know, it\u2019s usually a little bit hard for me. It\u2019s hard enough for me on Sunday that James really noticed. I don\u2019t really know what to do there. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(pause 02:30 \u2013 02:46)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Anyway, I just feel very lonely when I\u2019m with James and Franco. (pause) I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s because I feel like he and James can sort of \u2013 in some ways, they have a lot more shared interests than I have with either of them right now, and so they usually are the ones talking for most <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">of the time. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">It feels to me like Franco has just been very closed off in the past year or so, and James said that he sort of closed off to both of us, and not just me. I believe him, mostly, but (pause) I don\u2019t know. Then he was like, \u201cIt\u2019s fine not to be able to really talk to people that you don\u2019t know very well.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve known Franco for ten years now. He\u2019s one of my best friends.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:04:34) the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, and so it feels like we\u2019re having this \u2013 like, this series of very polite conversations that are friendly, but to me, it just feels very dull (ph). (pause) And to James, it feels like I am becoming distressed when he\u2019s talking with other people, like with his friends. He sees it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">in Franco when he\u2019s talking Franco. I think he sort of extends it to when he\u2019s talking with his other friends, but I said, \u201cI really think it\u2019s just Franco.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: But, I don\u2019t know.

(pause) Like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, part of being\u2026 When something happens on Saturday, it\u2019s a long time before I can talk to you about it.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(pause 00:07:09 \u2013 00:07:27)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: And I come at it like, in a way, that it also feels like keeping (ph) you out. I know that \u2013 they say that I\u2019m fairly accessible, actually, but still, I would think deciding whether to call me and when, brings up \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you feel like you can do casually. You know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">I mean, in that sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I could imagine it feels like I\u2019m keeping you out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562248\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Mmm.

Hopefully, (inaudible at 00:08:52). It\u2019s certainly not something that I\u2019m dwelling on \u2013 for, like, the answer, just coming back to (inaudible) (pause 00:09:07 \u2013 00:09:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">When something comes up, and I wish I could talk to you, it doesn\u2019t ever feel like I\u2019m frustrated or upset with you for not be accessible.

(pause 00:12:24 \u2013 00:12:43)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">I ran through a couple of papers that I\u2019d written as an (inaudible) student yesterday because a passage that I had worked on for a paper came up in church yesterday. It\u2019s one of my favorites. It\u2019s Deuteronomy 30:11-14. It was interesting to me, but when it came down to it, it wasn\u2019t like it\u2019s the best <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">paper I\u2019ve ever written. I had a lot of fun doing it, but it\u2019s fine. But it says a lot about me. (laughter) And a lot about what I was concerned with personally, at the time, and maybe a little bit about \u2013 it was on that passage from Deuteronomy and a passage from Romans where Paul basically reinterprets <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">the passage to mean something totally different. The passage is like\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Paul in the gospel just reinterprets the passage from Deuteronomy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s like, \u201cFor this commandment that I\u2019m giving to you is not too difficult for you, and it\u2019s not too far off. It\u2019s not up in the heavens that we should say who will go up again for us, or cross the sea.\u201d He would say, \u201cWho will go across the sea and get it for us?\u201d You know, the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">commandment is very near to you in your mind and in your heart to do it. So, physically\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s Deuteronomy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s Deuteronomy, and it\u2019s like Moses on his deathbed saying like, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay that I\u2019m dying. Israel is going to survive in a relationship with God, now that I\u2019m dead because you, like, have this Torah, and you really can do it, I promise, so there\u2019s no excuse not to.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: And then, for Paul, it\u2019s all about salvation through faith, so Romans is the big part where he\u2019s working out what that means. So he uses this passage and completely upends the meaning to make it be about Jesus, which is sort of like classic Paul, and also like classic Jewish sectarian writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">of the time period. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk), you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I talked about Paul, and I talked a little bit about some passages from the Dead Sea Scrolls community and how they sort of used the phrase, \u201cthe offering of the lips,\u201d not as a replacement for the temple offering. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not just as good as the temple offering, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">but better than the temple offering, is liturgical prayer.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562248\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Ah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Sorry, yeah. I\u2019m like, it could be a lot of things. (laughter) So, it\u2019s like all this stuff that I find fun, but I\u2019m reading through it, and it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I know the languages, and I\u2019m talking about them in interesting ways.\u201d But I can really see the way that I was concerned with how Judaism <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">and Christianity are (ph) related, and the ways in which I was concerned with the idea of people needing a mediator with God, and the way that I sort of very firmly believed that all of my spiritual problems can be solved through just better acts (ph) of Jesus. [00:16:31 ] (laughter) It was sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">solutary (ph). I caught a typo; it was embarrassing. (laughter) It wasn\u2019t as good as I sort of remembered it being, so that was also probably good for me. (laughter) But, I don\u2019t know. You know, it was fun, but also it made me really sad, but not necessarily a bad way. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">(pause 00:17:17 \u2013 00:17:53)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: It sort of made me wonder, \u201cDoes everybody else see that, too?\u201d (pause) I mean, I\u2019m certain that\u2019s the way other people write. A lot of \u2013 maybe, even most \u2013 academic work is that sort of working out what you care about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: [Searchers be searched] (ph) sort of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: (laughter) I don\u2019t know; it made me feel very sort of exposed. Yeah. Luckily, nobody\u2019s read this paper, (laughter) except the professor of the class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: I imagine most papers (inaudible at 00:18:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">(pause 00:18:54 \u2013 00:19:35)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: What strikes me about it is (pause) I imagine what was striking to you, looking at it again, was that you hadn\u2019t thought about it as being reflective of you in the ways that it was. I mean, I get the sense when you talk about what you were writing at the time, you\u2019re sort of working very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">hard, as I imagine you often do when you\u2019re writing papers like that, to kind of grapple with the issues that you\u2019re manifestly grappling with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And that this other stuff was sneaking in there. I\u2019m not saying it was different; it was just sort of more characteristic of you, or more personal than you felt like it was at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it feels less to me like stuff was sneaking in. It doesn\u2019t feel like stuff was particularly messing up my interpretation, so much as the topic choice was sort of manifestly personal in a way that I hadn\u2019t really realized. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: If we try to boil this down, it was stuff you were interested in and were sort of grappling with personally, which didn\u2019t take anything away from how you were grappling with it in the paper. It was just more indicative than you thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, I mean, I feel like it doesn\u2019t take anything from it.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, it\u2019s the theology (ph) department \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re okay with that. At least, I\u2019m pretty sure that particular professor would at least be pretty understanding of that, but I don\u2019t know.
