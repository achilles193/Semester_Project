That\u2019s actually not the way I wanted to leave. I don\u2019t want to live with my mother for a month, just to leave the country.\u201d  There\u2019s a choice in there. There is actually more happening on your terms than maybe meets the eye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: I see what you\u2019re saying, yeah. I\u2019m letting myself feel like I\u2019m somehow being pushed around or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">I think this unemployment thing was a bad trigger. That\u2019s just not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s coincidence. It actually doesn\u2019t mean anything different about your scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: No, it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s really shitty timing; really, really shitty timing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You could have absolutely used another couple months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. There\u2019s something symbolic about the Christmas to New Year. It\u2019s winter. It\u2019s like, \u201cMan, I just want to sleep.\u201d This is like a weird dream. It\u2019s not a nightmare; it\u2019s like I\u2019m living one of those dreams, in moment.  Everything seems hyper-real and weird. I can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB1\">just anxiety and I feel a little bit lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">I am trying to remind myself of that. It\u2019s all kind of excited. I\u2019m going to Assyria and it looks like there\u2019s a lot going on there. I have a lot of potential there. I\u2019m trying to remind myself that, \u201cActually, you know what? That\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s ballsy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">Which is what a few of my friends were saying, they\u2019re like, \u201cDude, how do you do this shit? That\u2019s so awesome. You created your own\u2014\u201d They were asking me how did that happen, that job. When I heard myself say it, I kind of created it. I saw an opportunity and I called them and I made a job for myself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\"> That\u2019s pretty cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561614\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">Maybe I\u2019m just nervous.

I\u2019m just nervous\u2014what\u2019s happening? I\u2019m suddenly\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And as much as I know that the reality of not having unemployment essentially for two months is real and daunting, there may also be a way that the nervousness kind of capitalizes on that, as in getting yourself down in a very old way \u2013 like the forces against you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">That\u2019s more familiar than safe than, \u201cNo, you\u2019re still going to Assyria, because that\u2019s what you wanted to do.\u201d What is that going to (crosstalk at 00:13:52)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Actually, that\u2019s a very optimistic new chapter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s what you wanted to do! When I asked you if you had the same job offer here, you said, \u201cNo, I\u2019d still go.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019d still go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">Yeah, it\u2019s nervousness. It is capitalizing\u2014it\u2019s even capitalizing on what if I go there and it\u2019s not what I think? It almost seems too good to be true, in a way. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s that amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">I don\u2019t know, that I\u2019m going to get there and I don\u2019t know what. I think because I feel so financially insecure. What if I get there and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, we can only offer you one class, maybe.\u201d If they don\u2019t embrace me the way I\u2019m hoping to really have a foot in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">There\u2019s no sign at all that that would happen. I\u2019m just worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">I think the ultimate nightmare would be for things to not go well there, and then come back here just zero.  Now I am living with my mom, because I don\u2019t have a choice. I don\u2019t have any money. It\u2019s Boston, so it would take me forever to have the money again to have a proper apartment. It\u2019s thousands <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">and thousands of dollars to do that. Or I\u2019d have to wait again for the upstairs tenant \u2013 whoever it is \u2013 to leave and go back\u2014I\u2019m tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">But, again, then that makes me optimistic, in a way. Because I feel like, \u201cWell, then, that means I\u2019m not coming back here until things are good.\u201d One way or the other, things have to work out there. I have friends, whatever. If I need to, I\u2019m going to have to be like, \u201cLook, man. You guy are all fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD1\">patriotic, rah-rah-rah. You wanted me to come\u2014I\u2019m here. Help me find a job\u2014help me stay here. You\u2019re all these connections. Get me a fucking decent job.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">Again, I think that\u2019s my nervousness going in an extreme direction, instead of just remembering, \u201cWait a minute, no. This woman is very excited for me to be there.\u201d We\u2019ve talked several times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:16:20) sort of, in a way, from the reality of these conversations you\u2019ve had with her, which were pretty clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: I think I can\u2019t face anymore. I want to make such a clean break with these douchebags that I cannot come back here again in that way. Coming back from London\u2014that was different. I came back happy. It was grad school. It was, \u201cAll right, did all the classes. Now it\u2019s just dissertation time, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">coming home.\u201d I did it.

Even though the weird thing is\u2014there is\u2014it\u2019s clearly going to kind of work, one way or the other. There\u2019s no need to feel so worked-up about it. I don\u2019t know if part of it is just that I\u2019m going to Assyria. Maybe it\u2019s not about work at all. Maybe it\u2019s a very loaded thing I\u2019m doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s about work, but it\u2019s also about (inaudible at 00:17:51).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess what I\u2019m saying is\u2014let\u2019s say I was going to Geneva or something. Yeah, it\u2019d be about work. I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve never been to Geneva but oh, exciting, Geneva, whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">Was there a difference between London and Paris? Not really. Objectively, yes, but not in a personal kind of\u2026 But this is very different. It feels very weird. In my mind, now, when I imagine, \u201cOh, yeah, in a few months I\u2019ll be standing in this spot.\u201d Photos I\u2019ve seen, places I\u2019ve read about. It\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">of mythologized for people in the diaspora. That\u2019s weird. There\u2019s something about that\u2014weird, cognitive dissonance or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">Which I\u2019ve heard from people; they\u2019re like, \u201cYou have to give yourself like a month or two.

I was going to say, that\u2019s been rearing its head the last week. Remember, I was saying? Since then, it\u2019s continued.  Someone dropped dead, they\u2019re 57. Or I\u2019ll watch a TV series and someone will have a heart attack in the TV series. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting that \u2013 I don\u2019t know, about a month ago, when we were last talking about this \u2013 you were connecting fear that something was going to go wrong, particularly with success. In other words, I think you even said, \u201cSo I marry Julia (sp) and have a nice, well-to-do family in Paris <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F51\">and get what I\u2019ve always wanted, and then something bad is going to happen.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">Is that how you thought of your father, in some way?
