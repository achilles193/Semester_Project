My mother came. My sister did not come. Her son had strep throat. They checked it and he looked completely fine, they just didn\u2019t get him on antibiotics in time. So it was nice introducing the two families to each other. Jennie\u2019s sister who \u2013 she\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">of difficult, she\u2019s neurotic in a way that\u2019s very similar to the way I imagine myself on the outside but she\u2019s also very Type A and the combination of the two is sometimes very challenging. She and I had a very sweet interaction the last time and she asked when she should come and I said, \u2018listen, we <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">don\u2019t need you for child care but come whenever and she started putting it about that I hadn\u2019t gotten back to her or something and so they could only come for the day rather than coming for a longer visit. She\u2019s fucking crazy. So I was kind of pissed off about that. The interaction was fine. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">just that it was weird. This kind of stuff that she pulls on Jennie, she\u2019s not pulling on me, which I think makes it appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: My mother was very sweet and she was spacy and she stayed up two nights with the kid just so Jennie and I could sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: She said she got him to sleep like three and a half to four hours at a stretch. And she was you know \u2013 I was up at 5 and (unclear) and there she was (inaudible). She\u2019s very generous. She\u2019s also very forgetful. She (unclear) the diaper rash. We talked about it. How my mother decided to let it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">\u2013 to \u201cair it out.\u201d But my mother insisted on carrying him everywhere so he like and feeding him and every time you feed him he\u2019s going to take a shit. So you know, (laughing) he didn\u2019t have a diaper on and naturally he took a shit and she got peed on, the diaper she was holding onto, the rug. After <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">that happened I cleaned it off. She came into the living room and she was holding him on the couch and of course he took a piss. It was so classic. When I went to pick her up at the airport her sweetness and her complete lack of attention to everything are inextricable from each other. So when I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">to pick her up at the airport her plane got in like an hour early and so, but Jennie \u2013 actually when she got in \u2013 and her mother had the car and they were at the grocery store and she said, \u2018well, I\u2019ll come as fast as I can,\u2019 and she said, \u2018no problem at all, I\u2019ll just wait at the baggage claim,\u2019 and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">we said ok, well you know, I guess I wasn\u2019t crystal clear but I figured she realize I can\u2019t come in, I\u2019d have to take the car and pick her up in a waiting area. So I said, \u2018okay, I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m getting there.\u2019 So I get there and as usual look in the arrival areas and there\u2019s a state policeman <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">moving everybody along for reasons of terrorist anxiety and I got there and I called her and the phone just rang through. So I called her again and the phone just rang through. So fuck, you know, so I left the hazard lights on and went across the two strips of traffic to the terminal and she was nowhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">to be found. Oh fuck, Jesus. And I turned around and on the plane this girl, this toddler, was coughing the whole trip so she wanted to change her clothes and wash up before she came in to see Grayson. And her phone was low on juice so she left her bag and the phone charging in the care of some stranger. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D7\">I think that after pacing up and down I saw her through the window I started banging on the window. Anyway. So again, this incredibly sweet (inaudible) madness, very weird execution sort of born to it. So the visit has been kind of like that. Grayson is just so \u2013 I was very moved during the ceremony <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D8\">and the blessing. It was a good blessing. I felt the devotion of that. We Skyped both my sister and her family because they didn\u2019t come and Jennie\u2019s dad from Jordan and a friend of ours came to the service. It was very \u2013 everybody was very touched by it. I got all of the people I really like to send <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D9\">blessings. It was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561404\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So how are you doing today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I forgot where we left the last discussion. But yeah, I don\u2019t know. We left an empty chair for my father that somebody sat in. So \u2013 it was nice. (inaudible) I had a conversation with my cousin who is retiring from the union that does the hospital workers negotiations. We\u2019ve been talking for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">the last year or so about her next gig and she\u2019s not decided if she\u2019s going to do this executive MPH program, this (unclear) program at UPenn. And she asked me what I was planning to do. And I said, \u2018you know, for now, I\u2019m just planning to change diapers.\u2019 (Laughs) She looked concerned. And I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">that was the only interaction that was remotely troubling to me. I\u2019m not sure what to make of where I am and what we need and what how to serve those needs best. I feel, as I was saying before, satisfied and actually, right in this role. And my mother said, actually to me, she said, \u2018you know he went <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">to Asia and did all these things and I see you being a father, it just seems to fit so well on you.\u2019 And it just seemed to be such a nice thing to say and who knows, maybe it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m done like the rest of the world. So maybe that was what was troubling to me about (unclear). I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">her to be a housewife but I\u2019m not sure, A) what the next hoorah would be, and B) I guess how to get there seems mysterious to me. I think the getting there has always been mysterious to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">On the other hand, I guess the getting to this, you know, I have a sweet family that is also a mysterious one. Somehow, I navigated it so mysterious would be feasible. (inaudible). Anyway, no more (unclear) reflections for the moment I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">(PAUSE): [00:12:36 00:12:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: It really does feel like the work of my hands. It\u2019s not something that came easily \u2013 creating this household. It\u2019s not something that wants without some very conscious effort \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Where the component parts were, the challenge of it. Not of the fathering but the fathering \u2013 the actual interaction with this infant, but I\u2019m finding instruction of that, the progression, organization, all those things to be a challenge. I guess I keep getting a lot of satisfaction with that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">Whenever people come into our house and say they feel good. They feel good coming into our house. They feel some peace and happiness, contentment, love, (inaudible) and so do I.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561404\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">(PAUSE): [00:14:18 00:14:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s fantastic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, no, it\u2019s nice to (inaudible).

You know, like we mentioned it sort of peeking through the clouds or being in the offing or being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">kind of out there but it seems like you\u2019re kind of coming up to the edge of talking about it, but not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: What is it I\u2019m not talking about? Just right now, very explicit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Going back to work. I don\u2019t mean that you plan to do it today or tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t understand the observation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: When you said \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I mean I understand the observation, but I don\u2019t see \u2013 I guess I don\u2019t get why the basis for it. I don\u2019t understand the basis for the observation. It seems like I am talking very explicitly about it. I\u2019m not \u2013 Beckett just put it \u2013 just made it seem like I\u2019m kind of touching upon it but not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">getting into it \u2013 it seems like that\u2019s all I\u2019m getting into, I just don\u2019t know \u2013 I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I feel. I feel I don\u2019t know what I want to do bur I\u2019ve said that, I think pretty explicitly. But not knowing is not quite the same as not getting into it. I feel challenged by it. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">feel uncertain about it. I feel a little confused about it, maybe. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m avoiding this at least the way that I understood what you were saying. I was kind of walking up to it, and yet not diving into it. Unless you mean that I\u2019m not diving into like actively looking for a gig which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">true except that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it doesn\u2019t like it\u2019s the timing.

I\u2019m just kind of uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(PAUSE): [00:12:24 00:20:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me that we have sort of two different views of two different things. Yeah it seems like we have \u2013 to me it does kind of sound like you kind of come up to the edge of talking about it and then don\u2019t seem to dive in, although I\u2019m aware you say you are talking about it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">just don\u2019t know what else to say. And then \u2013 that\u2019s thing one that I think our (unclear) is different. And thing two is I don\u2019t think necessarily you\u2019re avoiding talking about it although it seems to me that\u2019s how, that\u2019s where I seem to be coming from with like saying something like, \u2018you\u2019re kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">choosing not to,\u2019 or, \u2018you\u2019re avoiding it.\u2019 It just seems that\u2019s a little more attributive to you than what I have in mind. In other words, like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">(PAUSE): [00:21:28 \u2013 21:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Maybe you just don\u2019t want to talk about it or maybe \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t quite seem like you\u2019re -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I had a son three weeks ago and I am very excited to talk about that so I imagine that it\u2019s sort of diving into this very kind of complicated and troubling question of my other work in the world is by comparison not very appealing. So there\u2019s probably some of that and also just because of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">completely new and remarkable experience I just want to talk about that a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561404\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Again, it seems like you feel I\u2019m telling you you should be doing something or that you\u2019re not doing something you\u2019re supposed to be doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Ah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: I mean the only reason I\u2019m bringing it up at all because you said, like I could see how they\u2019re kind of peeking through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: And you said things like that recently, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m responding to and again I think actually that issue where it does feel to you like I\u2019m telling you you should be doing -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: No, no.

Well certainly if you said to me, \u2018I\u2019m just not going to think about it for the next X weeks or months, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: And actually that\u2019s what I\u2019ve kind of done. Almost verbatim when I said to Beth-Ann, I was like, \u2018you know, I just need to take a couple of months and figure out what\u2019s what. Because I feel burned, I feel disappointed, disillusioned and I\u2019m not sure what I want to do next. So you know the birth, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">apart from being beautiful and wonderful, is also (unclear) gratuitous maybe and we\u2019ll just make ends meet while that\u2019s happening. You know so I have that idea in my head and yet I think the fact that I\u2019m sort of assigning you the job of expressing disapproval is interesting and significant. Thing one <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">was clear the moment you said it. And then I kind of lost it again. Would you repeat it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: How much sleep have you had in the last three weeks? Sure. I\u2019ll be happy to. I think it was I think, well so, I had said it seems to me that you kind of walk up to the edge and don\u2019t dive in and you said, oh, I feel like I am talking about it. And you know more, I haven\u2019t said to you (unclear) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">talking about it but I just don\u2019t know what else to say.\u2019 And so it just had a different feel to each of us actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: The referent here being my statement that it was sort of peeking through the clouds but it\u2019s not quite \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that statement today along with some others in recent weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, no, I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">(PAUSE): [00:25:36 00:25:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: So I think what I take from thing one and two is that right now I\u2019m in the literal sense of the word, ambivalent. There are two kinds of contrary impulses that I\u2019m trying to reconcile and they\u2019re operating in a seriously but not unprecedentedly for me or anyone else complicated way without kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">of resolving themselves to one strategic approach or one state of mind because these states of mind are kind of on parallel tracks. And you know the implications among others for the way that I\u2019m feeling is very strangely simultaneous incidents of great ease and contentment and satisfaction and joy <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">and great unease and uncertainty and whatever and they\u2019re just there together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: So beyond the practicalities of the matter I think that\u2019s the most concise description of where I\u2019m coming from right now. I don\u2019t know. And the peeking through the cloud-ness could also be described as something to the effect that you know, these two states of mind are simultaneous and yet <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">just my feeling of joy and contentment just completely overwhelms the other. You know except for some very occasional squalls, but presumably the weather will ultimately change and I have a sense that the other meteorological phenomenon is not going away. It\u2019s not being blown out to sea for forever <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200812\">and a day. It\u2019s not going anywhere. But for the moment, at least, what I\u2019m feeling is really dominated by wonderment. My blessing was kind of about, among other things, something that I\u2019ve been puzzling over \u2013 let me put it that way \u2013 that made its way into my blessing, is newborn\u2019s experience of hunger. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200813\">I just find it repeatedly interesting and moving I guess how freaked out Grayson gets when he gets hungry and how surprised and confused he is when he has to digest something. You know both of these being incredibly powerful feelings and sensations and requirements that were completely unnecessary for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200814\">all of his consciousness, you know, all of the period in which he was \u2013 you know, all of the consciousness that he has \u2013 they were completely unnecessary for everything except three weeks. So suddenly three weeks ago he felt hunger. Suddenly three weeks ago he felt himself digesting. Suddenly three <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200815\">weeks ago it was like, oh my God. No wonder he\u2019s freaked out every time he gets hungry. How vulnerable that must feel. Something that \u2013 a vulnerability you completely forget at some point \u2013 or not forget \u2013 it will soon be there, but forget that you felt that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561404\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">(PAUSE): [00:30:33 \u2013 00:30:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been reading Daniel Siegel, you\u2019ve probably run across him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Where did \u2013?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t remember where (unclear) The Developing Mind. He\u2019s into this kind of interaction in the creation of mind between environment and sort of (unclear) theology. This is a kind of academic book. He has kind a more popular book called, Diary of a Baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Oh, I\u2019ve heard of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I haven\u2019t read that one. I\u2019ve just read this one. Anyway, it\u2019s like empathy with a newborn is so hard because I\u2019ve forgotten all of these things but they\u2019re still there. And he has a theory that you can\u2019t access them yet somehow behind every other operation you have an imprint or residue <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">or what have you of this experience. Somehow. I\u2019m not quite sure what to make of that. I think I mentioned a week ago or so that Jennie very explicitly made this connection between his startles in his sleep and mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Maybe that\u2019s what got me thinking on this stream of thought. So it\u2019s interesting to be at this transitional moment and to have this young person in the household like on the one hand he\u2019s this person and on the other hand he\u2019s like this experimental subject this generic human being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">(PAUSE): [00:33:20 \u2013 33:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: His (unclear) to me is very strong and I have to fight off the urge to just see everything that happens to him. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s not something you \u2013 I thought of reading part of a poem I wrote for my dad and then I \u2013 you know we didn\u2019t give him any family names. We gave him four names in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">end because the rabbi asked us what we wanted his Hebrew name to be. And we ended up just picking two names that we liked but discarded because they were two foreign. So he has four names that we love but that don\u2019t have any family significance which you know, as I was thinking about it is great \u2013 you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200952\">know, not saddling this small person with baggage seems like something that would be very desirable. So in that vein I think I\u2019m wary of acclimating him, you know bringing him into my consciousness in a way that gives him too much responsibility for modeling myself at that age. But you know he is a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200953\">person. He\u2019s a human. I mean there are things that he does that I think are pretty (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561404\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">Anyway, so I hunger and desires run so strong. He\u2019s very, he\u2019s very good with his hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Right. Two fisted thumb sucking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Two fisted thumb sucking. Convenience, right? And he\u2019s very good at \u2013 relatively good at self-soothing and the combination of those things means that when he\u2019s in distress his go-to thing will be to bring his hands to his mouth for some comfort, and it\u2019s so moving, literally and figuratively, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">I mean it\u2019s like, it\u2019s moving. He\u2019s not just distressed he\u2019s like trying to figure it out, figure out how to deal with it. And you know, among other things it\u2019s nice because it allows us not to get to that point if we can just to stick a bottle in his mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Sometimes he\u2019s so distressed and responding in such as proactive way that you can\u2019t get the bottle in his mouth because he\u2019s jammed his hands in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And you think he\u2019s precociously able to like provide some of the soothing that the bottle does by (unclear) at his hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: I guess so. I don\u2019t know about the precocious part. And I don\u2019t know about the able part in the sense that he can\u2019t sooth his hunger with his hand \u2013 nice as that might be, with his hand. But he\u2019s precociously \u2013 you can speak to the precocious. He\u2019s inspired to do this in a way that I haven\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">seen in other newborns but I haven\u2019t seen any other newborns although I haven\u2019t seen any other newborns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it\u2019s very unusual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">(PAUSE): [00:37:31 \u2013 00:37:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You might let your pediatrician know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I mean, it\u2019s so characteristic of him to the point where when I just imagine this sweet little being in my head it\u2019s not moments of repose that come to mind, it\u2019s his moments of stress and complexity. We have many \u2013 he\u2019s often very, very calm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Not because there are more of those moments \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Definitely not. Quite to the contrary. You know, again, and what I take as unusual in a newborn, he can be up for two and a half hours and just completely hanging out. In fact, during the whole ceremony he was not \u2013 he was asleep. He slept through the entire ceremony. And I was saying to Jennie, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">or maybe to Beth-Ann, my cousin, I was saying, this just made it crystal clear how right it feels not to circumcise him. Because, you can imagine, that would not have been the case at that been done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: But yeah, no, I mean, so he\u2019s just like, it\u2019s not the most frequent state of being for him by any stretch of the imagination, and yet maybe it just feels very remarkable to me that, A) that the feeling is so strong in an infant, not that as I was saying a moment ago, it\u2019s just striking to me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">and B) it feels remarkable to me that he is able to make what seems like a fairly high level decision to try to intervene with himself. Not to just feel distress but to do something about it. And that seems like a constructive (unclear). One that others who shall go unnamed should probably do well to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B32\">try and emulate. Rabbi Larry gave a very nice Biblical commentary for part of the proceeding. Apparently, the Hebrew name we gave him was Ido who was one of the more obscure prophets and apparently he was the prophet under a very bad king, which there were many of course, and the king did something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B33\">terrible and Ido cursed him or did something and his hand withered and the king came to Ido and said, \u2018heal me, (unclear).\u2019 It was a nice story.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561404\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.
