(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I feel like it\u2019s going to be a little hectic, just because I have these experiments I\u2019m doing with another assistant, Sophia, and she\u2019s a little stubborn and possessive. (pause) We\u2019ve worked together many times, but it\u2019s very draining just to work with her.  I guess my point is I\u2019m worried about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">being on top of things, but also not being consumed or tipping over. (long pause)  Other than that, I guess not much happened this weekend. I\u2019m still kind of feeling I want a little space or room from people.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being stubborn or making a bad decision, just wanting to not do very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">much and [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:57). I guess I feel like I\u2019m kind of wasting time or bad, like I should be out doing things. For some reason I feel like, in order to do the things that I want to be doing, having time and space for myself . . . (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you\u2019re a little bit worried about the possibility of being consumed there, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I think I talked about this last week, but with some of my friends I\u2019ve said so much that I\u2019m worrying about how I\u2019m coming off or what they think of me. It\u2019s easier to just to [take up space] (ph) or . . . I don\u2019t know. (pause)  It doesn\u2019t really seem like nothing really progresses <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">into the state between . . . Sometimes Barbara and I are kind of okay and I don\u2019t have to worry, but most of the time and with others, too, it\u2019s always me worrying I need to do something or [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:48) where I feel like it\u2019s okay or [ ]. (pause)  I guess I really don\u2019t like feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">I\u2019m going back and forth between wanting distance or wanting their attention or support. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re feeling that the balance there between you and me at the moment feels all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I guess because it\u2019s kind of established.  There\u2019s more certainty. (long pause) The thing I\u2019m hung up on is [I have enough to do to put] (ph?) these flimsy kinds of relationships where I feel like if I put myself out there and invest or really try to make it more, I\u2019m more consumed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">or hurt or it takes over my life more than I want it to; where I feel like if I have distance I can have more control over myself, I guess.  (pause) I also don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being dramatic or too needy or something. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019m a little bit confused about something. The thing you\u2019re hung up on is not to do with the flimsy relationships. Do you mean that what you\u2019re feeling more hung up on is your own struggle \u2013 not the relationships, per se, but your own struggle around being able to invest without then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">being more consumed or more hurt than you want? Or have I misunderstood?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s kind of both. I\u2019ve kind of noticed that I have these relationships and I don\u2019t want them to be like this. I want them to be more secure and not so dependent or [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:56).  Also I guess I want \u2013 yeah \u2013 just security within myself and form a positive relationship, not this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">pushing and pulling or something. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s other people. I don\u2019t know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562230\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I think I\u2019m following that you\u2019re sort of confused or wondering \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s largely about you \u2013 what is it about you that\u2019s causing you to have this kind of trouble. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I think there are multiple things. I guess there is always this feeling of needing to connect or needing . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I want to be clear that I\u2019m not saying that I necessarily see this as all on you, nor am I necessarily posing the question, but I\u2019ll be interested in your thoughts, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve thought about it, but there is always something I don\u2019t like, like it\u2019s either not the way I want it to be or not progressing the way I want it to be.  [Everything that person does is like being with Marlowe] (ph?); it\u2019s kind of wrong or dangerous and I want space or I don\u2019t trust that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">person or there is a lot in that person that makes me worry about myself and kind of rattles me.  So either way I guess I\u2019m not okay with how things are, but I don\u2019t really know what to do to soothe it or find something in the middle. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I guess you feel very unsafe and the person kind of gets scary or intimidating in some fashion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I guess I\u2019m just thinking about what I should do, if I should just let it be and not try to be so affected.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Maybe you think that if you do the right thing you\u2019ll feel safer? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Or more secure or not worrying so much about what that person is thinking or what is going on between us or trusting of them. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know. (pause) [Like having Paul half around,] (ph?) it affects me a lot and I really don\u2019t know what to do.  It makes me feel kind of insecure and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">almost crazy from thinking that, because I go back and forth between wanting a lot or wanting nothing at all. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It seems like you\u2019re having a pretty hard time with him. I\u2019m not saying a hard time compared to how it\u2019s been before, but I think an insecure and kind of crazy feeling a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I don\u2019t know. (long pause)  I guess I\u2019m so confused by the situation it kind of makes me feel unsettled because I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I feel like I don\u2019t have any say or any persuasion or power or control. It\u2019s always me waiting or wondering or worrying and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">idea of letting go or stopping responding or whatever, it\u2019s kind of like willpower \u2013 I can do it for so long and then I fall apart or [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:20).  (long pause)  I really don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m just waiting. I\u2019m kind of stuck waiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I know you\u2019re afraid of Paul and I know this aspect of your relationship with him, which has always been quite prominent, has been frustrating and crazy-making for quite a long time. I do wonder if there is also an aspect of that here, not [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:28) because certain ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I\u2019m quite consistent and available in certain ways, but I imagine there is another sense where it\u2019s hard to know where I\u2019m coming from or what\u2019s going on inside of me or, at another level, what I really think about what you\u2019re saying or other things about you, where you can\u2019t get in or I keep you out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">or you don\u2019t or can\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.  I imagine that is how you feel a lot with Paul? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562230\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. A little. (pause)  With Paul, it always feels like he\u2019s not allowing me to get out from under this or like I don\u2019t have control; but here it\u2019s more [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:29). It doesn\u2019t feel that way, but I guess there is not clear direction. It\u2019s not like I have this problem <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">and I need to do this and this or something.  (pause) There is a part of it where I\u2019m like okay, I\u2019ll be vulnerable or at times I\u2019ll be more stubborn or closed off and be like well, I\u2019m just being ridiculous. I guess that\u2019s the way I kind of treat him. I\u2019ll be okay; I\u2019ll be more vulnerable and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">be like \u2013 no.  To myself I\u2019ll be like I should [pressure him] (ph?) or allow him to do that, but it\u2019s kind of like that here where I feel like I\u2019m being ridiculous; I should muscle up or armor up, so there is a similarity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: So, in a sense, you mean responding to a kind of vulnerability in yourself by kind of closing off or getting stubborn?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. On both sides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m being ridiculous or something, it\u2019s just from me, like the lack of feedback or reassurance that I\u2019m not being \u2013 or maybe you feel the same way or something like that. So I guess the switch is kind of internal from the [other side] (ph?).  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I imagine it sort of feels to you like there is an opacity, that you and I are opaque \u2013impenetrable is a bit of a dramatic way to put it, but closed off; or that that is sort of what you\u2019re responding to in this dynamic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Although I\u2019m also clear that you sort of take it on yourself and feel like your response to that is that it\u2019s all kind of problematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I guess it\u2019s kind of like I just feel ridiculous, like I\u2019m kind of irrational or need to calm down or not be so needy or be someone who has problems with everything and just grow up or suck it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Maybe there is something I don\u2019t understand \u2013 I\u2019m sure there are things that I don\u2019t understand \u2013 but in the moment, things between you and he, what you\u2019re referring to now, are you talking about this unwillingness to say anything about the . . .  I guess what I\u2019m feeling uncertain about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">with him is his refusal to talk about how he feels about you or what he wants between you or where he sees it going; that would be one option. The other option would be something more like he just thinks things are kind of fine the way they are and he doesn\u2019t see why you would need to talk more about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">stuff. He\u2019s just fine letting things go as they\u2019ve been going. Do you know what I mean? In the first version, it\u2019s more like he\u2019s actively keeping you out.  In the second version, he doesn\u2019t really even see a problem, where you feel like there is a big problem and it\u2019s something that\u2019s not being discussed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s more the latter where I\u2019m aware of where he stands on things, but he kind of keeps toying with me.  That\u2019s kind of the problem. I guess it keeps me around or hoping and he kind of has all the control. [He\u2019s even kind of said that.] (ph?) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562230\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: I see. So the parallel to in here \u2013 although clearly there are ways that it\u2019s quite different \u2013 is that if you\u2019re feeling we need to figure out what to do and what you can do in order to handle situations that are giving you trouble, it\u2019s kind of like I don\u2019t seem to feel the same need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">figure out what the course of action should be; and that just leaves you hanging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I see.  (long pause)  You feel like I\u2019m in a very different place in terms of what we need and seem somehow to be able to feel secure with things or okay with things, in spite of your being in this anxious, hanging state where you really want to feel more grounded by knowing where things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">are at and what to do. That\u2019s a little muddled, but something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Then a part of what gets alienating for you is that most of the time, he or I aren\u2019t exactly acknowledging that there is this big problem, which feels so imminent and overwhelming to you. So part of what makes you feel like it\u2019s on you and there is something very much the matter with you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">is that it\u2019s not something that Paul feels or I feel in the same way as you or even acknowledge in the same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Right.  (long pause) And the feeling that there is a problem makes me feel ridiculous or kind of makes me feel I\u2019m creating it or that I need to not be vulnerable to this problem or I need to cut it off.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking about it because I think there is a way that there is something else that sort of creeps into this, at least between you and I. And actually, I may be wrong, but I think that this is something that\u2019s changed in you over time, over the months here.  I think often it seems more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">so to you that just because I don\u2019t propose an action or feel that we need a strategy \u2013 I could still think there is a real problem. I just don\u2019t think that . . . I\u2019m getting a little garbled here, but I imagine that you feel more so that if I didn\u2019t have a strategy or I didn\u2019t see the need to do something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">it meant I didn\u2019t think there was really a problem.  Whereas I suspect you feel differently about that now and that if I don\u2019t tell you what to do or even have ideas about what to do about something that\u2019s giving you trouble, it leaves a little bit more room for maybe I still see that there is a problem, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200533\">but what will help is something a little different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Sometimes it kind of feels that way and sometimes it kind of feels like what the hell do I do now?
