I mean \u2013 not that I didn\u2019t see you! I was like, \u201cAw, fuck, I hope something doesn\u2019t happen\u201d or something. And there\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s exactly the same, so it\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a relief, in a way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s a total relief, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:00:42)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how things are, really. On the one hand, when I feel down, then I have these empirical pieces of evidence on my plate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">My sleep is totally fucked, that\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s totally fucked. I\u2019m basically staying up all night and then sleeping until noon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I think that might not change until I start exercising more \u2013 or, well, at all, or something else starts to happen to give me a little more structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">It\u2019s a transitional time. My mind\u2019s awake. I\u2019m up at night. I\u2019m not even anxious \u2013 maybe I am, but not in a way that feels anxious. I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like that was more so in the last couple weeks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: [Less than now.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been this way for at least several weeks (inaudible at 00:02:01).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">My website\u2019s done, tentatively. I was going to send it to you. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d want to\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how appropriate that is; because I\u2019d be very curious, obviously, to see what you think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">I think it\u2019s a little wordy. Everyone seems to really like it, but I\u2019m concerned that it\u2019s a little wordy. But then I know that that\u2019s how I am: I feel like I\u2019m wordy when I know that I\u2019m not, I guess, a lot of times. I might tweak that a little bit. The only other thing I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">to make a video or something, like a very brief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">The trick is \u2013 I was telling my friends \u2013 the wordy thing; most of them didn\u2019t think it was wordy at all.  But for me, it was like, well... I do feel like, \u201cWhat qualifies me to be a life coach?\u201d I feel like I need to explain a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">Then a few of my friends were like, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d (laughs) They were like, \u201cHave you looked at some of these other websites?\u201d Their bios are just general: \u201cX has been a motivational speaker for ten years!\u201d but it doesn\u2019t say anything specific. That\u2019s like me saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been a life coach all my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">life, I just didn\u2019t know it!\u201d So I don\u2019t know. I might tweak some of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">So that\u2019s done. I think a big part of what\u2019s happening now is now I\u2019m scared. I mean, really, I guess I could launch it if I wanted to. You can always tweak your website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">I keep telling people, \u201cI want to get all my ducks in a row and make sure\u2026\u201d What else is there to get? People like the website. I mean, yeah, I might tweak it, but there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be up. Now I\u2019m scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: So scared of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: This is the biggest transition in my life. This is huge. Everything is changing right now. I played my first solo show \u2013 did I talk to you about that?

It was fucking amazing. I played a few by myself, and then Stu (sp) came up with the guitar. It was fucking awesome. It was amazing. I didn\u2019t feel fucking nervous. I was very in-control of myself. Most of the people there were there to see me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the first time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: In my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I did it once before, once before. But you know why that doesn\u2019t count?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m pretty sure that was the night I got arrested. Yeah, I think that was. I could be wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">I did it once. It was also acoustic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I\u2019m remembering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was acoustic. And I guess because I don\u2019t even\u2014at this point, even though that wasn\u2019t that long ago at all, that seems like such a different time, now. I was super-fucking-nervous. I wasn\u2019t who I am now. People enjoyed it, but I was\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the kind of thing where I did <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">it and was like, \u201cOh, whoa, yeah, I did it! Now let me do more!\u201d [0:06:01] I was glad it was over. I didn\u2019t want to do it again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">Now, I can\u2019t wait to do this again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:06:08) this was your first show in this self.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:06:12)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Just like this band is the first band with this self. It was awesome. It sounded good. I liked everything about it. I\u2019m ready to do more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">What were you saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re saying how this is a turning point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, the band stuff. My relationship with my family now has really has\u2014the way I am, just a switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">Like with my mom, I really am not interacting with her much. Today, she left me a message, \u201cAre you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?\u201d  I feel bad. Something in me is done with making small talk; just done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">So that\u2019s totally changed. You name it. How I\u2019m thinking about women and everything \u2013 where I want to live, even. How I want my life to be. It\u2019s all pretty awesome, I think, but it\u2019s a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: And this business is\u2014in a way, you\u2019re just describing as something that makes sense given what\u2019s been there all along. In another way, it\u2019s a really different venture for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, very different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Very different chapter (crosstalk at 00:08:12) thinking about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: In a way, that\u2019s how I know \u2013 actually, I was just thinking this now \u2013 that\u2019s how I know it\u2019s the right move. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t be this scared, per se. Even when I\u2019ve had teaching jobs, I get nervous \u2013 the normal nervous you get when you have a new job, especially when you have to talk in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">front of people and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">With this one, I can already envision myself tapping into the part of me that\u2019s a good speaker and motivational and fucking life coach. When I envision that, it almost makes me feel shy or something. I feel like, \u201cWow. I can really probably do this really well.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">I looked at the office space. I remembered that in San Diego, when I was down there with Jerry (sp), we really needed to use the bathroom. I walked by this place \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what it was, but I saw a lot of people. There was no security. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to walk in here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561710\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">I walked in. As I start trying to find the bathroom, some girl just came up. She\u2019s like, \u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d It turned out that this was some common work sharing office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">I suddenly remembered that. I looked it up and as I was looking it up, another good thing that happened, I had an appointment with this girl Isabella (sp), who\u2019s been in the scene a long time, who wants to help manage my music \u2013 which is really great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">She happens to use an office like that, in the Square. There\u2019s one called like the Bar (sp) in the Square. I was there Monday. It was like, \u201cThis is exactly what I\u2019m talking about. This is what I need.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">So even there, then I had this manifestation of like, \u201cWow. This is kind of amazing. Not only for life coaching. I could come here and write.\u201d It\u2019s like guilting yourself, in a good way. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m paying for this space,\u201d and it\u2019s an amazing\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Making your job, in a way \u2013 literally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a beautiful space. They\u2019ve done a really good job. Even while I was there, I felt more productive. Because there\u2019s people all\u2014you\u2019re in it together. Everyone\u2019s doing their own, but there\u2019s that energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">We met in this conference room, and it was like, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? This is where I would\u2026\u201d Once you schedule appointments, then I would know when I need to be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: So in a separate office, it\u2019s (inaudible at 00:11:08) door?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like a gym. There are tiered memberships. You can pay, I think the minimum\u2014I would initially pay like $125 a month. And what that gets you is a couple of hours a month, you can use it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">What Isabella pays is the standard, like it\u2019s $300 or $340. She gets to use it as her business address, which is the other thing I haven\u2019t thought of. Even if it\u2019s a website, there probably should be a mailing address or something. I don\u2019t want to use my house and I don\u2019t want to use a P.O. box. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">I use that as her\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">That\u2019s one. You don\u2019t get an office, but what you get is unlimited use of conference rooms. So if every day, I had an appointment or I scheduled in one day, three appointments, whatever, I just make sure I block off times.  It\u2019s like this size, really, really nice, modern. It was really impressive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">You can hook up your laptop wirelessly to the TV, so people can look right at your laptop screen. Whatever, it\u2019s pretty cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">I can\u2019t afford $300, $400 right now. It\u2019s something. I think the kind of people I want to attract \u2013 what, they\u2019re going to come to my house? They\u2019re going to meet me at a coffee shop?

Not that I\u2019m attracting the wrong people, but the better you do in life \u2013 whatever that means to you \u2013 you end up in better situations. When we end up in those situations, then more opportunities open <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">up to meet more people \u2013 if that makes any sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">Because, really, how am I meeting people? Okay, stupid, maybe at a bar. It\u2019s just these half-assed ways of meeting people.

You were talking about\u2014and you literally used a hand gesture to describe it.

We\u2019re both musicians, but we\u2019re also kind of professional people. She\u2019s been through a lot. I\u2019ve been through a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">Not that I didn\u2019t have that with Kelly, but with Kelly, there was some other things that weren\u2019t quite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">With her, in a way, it\u2019s what I\u2019m saying about everything else. What if it did work out? Then that\u2019s a whole other. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">I think I am going to be less scared about\u2026 If you miss somebody, I think it\u2019s okay to tell them you miss them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: You told me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.

She\u2019s the one who went out of her way to tell me she thinks I\u2019m a really good friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that sounds like that \u2013 the anxiety problem from being very young about your own affection being reciprocated (crosstalk at 00:30:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s all it is, exactly. And then, because unfortunately it got reinforced \u2013 some really bad relationship situations \u2013 now I just feel like\u2014and especially someone like her.  She\u2019s just one of these girls that just has this incredible magnetism. There\u2019s something about her. It\u2019s beguiling <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201771\">\u2013 that\u2019s a good word about her, is beguiling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">So, one, it scares me, because, yeah, Samantha was beguiling. Meredith was beguiling. And they weren\u2019t people I should have been with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">But two, that, yeah, that\u2019s the scariest feeling for me. When I feel that strongly, wanting some kind of reciprocation from someone and not getting it or whatever. Or getting it and then suddenly not having it anymore. That\u2019s a bad childhood thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2017A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561710\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">Which, amazingly enough, has improved to the point where I can totally deal with it.

(inaudible at 00:32:26) is the part of what\u2019s so exhilarating, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F1\">that\u2019s she\u2019s beguiling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Exactly. That\u2019s why I\u2019m stopping myself. \u201cIs that what\u2019s going on?\u201d Because I know she\u2019s so desired. She\u2019s just a super desirable person. Is it that she\u2019s up here, in the hierarchy of desirability?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">I need to get validation from her. I totally get that. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been very, very careful. Is it because I went over all the checklist?  I need to know that I\u2019m attractive to her. Once I get that, then I\u2019m going to try to find a way to get out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">I\u2019m being very careful about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">And also reminding myself that I\u2019ve already got that: this chick asked me to play a solo show; she thinks I\u2019m amazing. She\u2019s already validated! I\u2019m getting better at realizing. Not everything\u2019s about whether someone wants to have sex with you. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s secondary, but the fact that someone\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201871\">giving you that respect and seeing how talented you are and this and that \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of validation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: I wonder, is it sex?

When I was young, when I was little, I didn\u2019t think I was attractive, up until recently. I was half faking it. Some of it\u2019s that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: It seems that it\u2019s a validation of she wants that is physically attracted to me (crosstalk at 00:34:21) others<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, sex is almost secondary. Just knowing that a girl like that thinks I\u2019m really attractive. Yeah, it\u2019s a bummer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: And physically, then, your mind goes to (inaudible at 00:34:36) not about your attracted to you as a person.

Because that\u2019s a childhood silhouette (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">What was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:04)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. Wow, blowing Claire\u2019s (sp) mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">That\u2019s what all this is about, right? Meredith, Samantha, Michelle (sp), right? They\u2019re fucking models, in my mind. I knew that, empirically, every dude wanted these chicks, but I got them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">The sex part just comes with the package.
