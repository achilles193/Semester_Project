My buddies [Barry and Janice] (sp?), they're going away for the weekend. And they watch Hank so often that we're obliged to watch their double puggles. There's three puggles in the house, four within 30 feet of my house, because the next-door neighbor also has a puggle puppy. Black puggle <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">puppies are extremely rare. So that's cool. In fact that's them right now, being like... let's see. Any chance you could [walk them up] (ph)?

They're good, they're good. I mean, they're sweet. They're dumb as fuck. I talk about my dog being stupid, and he's really just below average. These dogs are (pause) dumb, really dumb. You have to watch Fanny (sp?) after any of the dog poops, because she will go for it. She's like, I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">going to eat that poop, man. She's like, it's going to be so fucking good (chuckling). You're gross. You're disgusting. Yeah, so... yeah. This week though...

Half of them is lap dog, the other half is hound. So the lap dog is pretty strong. But then once they're in the yard they're like, oh man. I want to hunt something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: In this 40 by 30 space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Now, Hank's the one that goes after the birds?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes, Hank totally killed and tried to eat baby birds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yes, so that's the hound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: That's the hound.

Always a blast. It's really not that bad usually, just the cleaning. Today, they'll be like, you're not flossing enough. I'm like, I know, I'm not. Fuck. [0:02:55] I always have a really good flossing interval and then a bad flossing interval. It's like, you should floss. You know what, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">you're right. Let's floss all the time. I love flossing. Yeah, floss! Then I'm like, I've been flossing really well.

(Pause) Yeah, so there we go. That's all handled. Word, exclamation point. Boom, done, conversation, ended. Just like that. Oh, what did we do before texting? We called people and hoped they were home, like idiots. That's what we did. Fucking... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: We were just a bunch of puggles (laughing).

(Pause) Do you think that maybe they're home? I don't know. Did you talk to them earlier this week about what they might be doing today? Well, it was a few days ago. Who can tell [any more] (ph)? I wish there was some way to quickly ascertain their state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, that's right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: And now it's like, I don't know, I sent them a text a couple hours ago. I hope everything's okay. Come on, who doesn't check their phone every couple of hours at least? [0:04:55] (Pause) I check mine fairly often [if it's not] (ph) in my pocket. (Yawning) [Whenever I go] (ph)... whenever I move <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">position I take it with me, and I put it somewhere close.

(inaudible at 0:05:35) various ancient and demonic gods. And [I do] (ph) quests for them to get in their medieval artifacts and walk through the world. I just became a werewolf last night, so that's nice. So using the ring as one demonic god (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">at 0:05:53) werewolf as many times as I want to over the course of the day, especially just the once. [0:05:59] So that's nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: The werewolf?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, werewolf. And you can't interact with most stuff. You can open doors and stuff like that. But mostly you just go through the thing, and then you eat them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Then you eat them, and every person you eat extends the duration of your werewolf transformation by 30 seconds. So you start with three minutes and then start traveling through dungeons, eating everybody you meet. And it's pretty fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Eating to keep on going, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, every person you eat gives you 30 more seconds, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Eating to live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and then when this is all over it's just you and your [one claw] (ph).

So what is everyone looking at?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What did it bring up to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: Well, just... it's one of those things where you're surfing for porn, and you start to get a little more curious. And you're like, what's a good word? I'm looking for girls who are just 18, just at 18. So I got a nubile. Let's put in nubile and search. Actually you click on a link you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200891\">is... you've checked out with Scamadviser and SiteAdvisor and Norton, Google, Safe Web and everything. And you're like, okay, it's not a spyware site. Whatever. [0:07:53] And you go there, and it looks really skeezy (sp?). And it's like, important, all girls here are 18 or older. And I'm like, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200892\">I'm out of here. This doesn't look great. And you get out of there, and you're like, oh my God. Did I just do something illegal? And the answer is no, honestly. Clearly (inaudible at 0:08:12) is weird. But then I was having this panic attack, like, oh my God, they're going to come here. And what if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200893\">one of those images in my browser cache is bad? And oh, no, then what happens? And the answer is nothing, because there's nothing there. And that's the reality of it, is that there's no problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560001\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yet I started going through this narrative of how will I kill myself in time?

Slicing your jugular open with a butcher knife, there's only a 66% chance that you go, and pretty high agony rating, too. [0:08:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Where does it...? If you... what's...? It's almost like you're killing yourself to get... to escape the... sort of the punish...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, any sort of legal repercussions for something I didn't do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Ah, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Time (ph). And even then, if it's not (inaudible at 0:09:17), it's an embarrassment, them being like, oh, you're looking at bad porn. I'm like, I'm not, though. [We thought you were, though] (ph), and now everything's fine. But everyone thinks you're a fucking sex offender.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Oh. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: And I don't want that, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: To be kind of exposed that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm sitting there having this panic attack in the morning, like, oh my God, what's going to happen? What's going to happen? And it's getting really bad. And so I google panic attack, and I'm like, how do you fix it? And they're like, try the five two five breath count. They're like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">give that a second. You breathe in for five seconds, you hold for two, then you breathe out for five seconds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Mmm. [0:10:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Then you repeat that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: And [as I sort of worked it down] (ph), I was like, okay, that's good. And so I was thinking, how do we prevent this? I'm like, well, you've been staying up really late and smoking weed pretty much constantly. So I'm like, this is not good for your anxiety. This is not good. And so actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">you need to slow down the weed. You need to cut back a little bit. Just not smoke it all day, [sometimes taking a number of] (ph)... several hour break in the middle of the day to help. And (pause) last night I'm like, oh, I'm starting to feel weird. Okay, time to take a break. But I'm sitting there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A92\">I'm like, okay, now if those... if you get scared about these things, then the solution is never to look for free porn. I'm like, and you know this. You know never to look for free porn because they make their money off either ads that pop up or ads that trick you into downloading malware. [0:11:08] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A93\">And a number of times where I was surfing, and this other window pops up with a sub-window, which is like, hey, there's a special deal here.

[0:13:57] She used to tell us about the time she was raped, and... or almost raped, as she says. She's like, yeah, a man tried to rape me in college.

It was really bad for his ulcers. And he was there at her table when she was a child. He was demanding that his sister, my grandmother, make him a cup of coffee, demanding. [0:16:00] So she probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201011\">(ph) made him a cup of coffee, and he was just drinking it. And then his stomach ruptured, he just bled out on the floor, internal bleeding. But yeah, he died. And she watched him die. And she used to make us feel lucky, because she didn't do those things to us. She was like, I don't break hairbrushes <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201012\">over your arm. She's like, I don't... [kind of the most horrible things, I want you to trust] (ph) I don't do any of those things. So you're lucky that I don't do things like Terrance (sp?) does. (Pause) Yeah, I remember my sister telling me... she would hit my sister pretty often. She'd hit my sister, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201013\">but never in the face.

My kid brother runs out of the bathtub naked when he's two. He runs over to see what James and I are doing at the Nintendo station (chuckling). And he trips, and he falls naked onto a shoe. His crotch is in the shoe, whole essentially, and he's trying to get up. And she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D1\">runs over screaming, stop him! He's masturbating on a shoe!

And she's like, one of the early warning signs even ten years ago was when we got out secret names, and he's like, what's your name? [0:25:50] She's like, oh, it's Elaine. She's like, what's yours? He's like, I'm not supposed to tell you. Because the man...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: The man, yeah. [0:25:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: The man knows hers, and she is not to know his, because he can call her through the veil, into heaven or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: Right.

You can't present creationism as anything other than complete mythology. It's like... I'm like, evolution happened. [0:36:04] She's like, okay, yeah (inaudible at 0:36:07), but why haven't they ever found a missing link? That's not settled. There are many, many, many missing links.

It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2025D3\">like, yeah, but we don't... you don't need to test every theory when you can see that it has happened, when you can look at millions of years of evidence and be like, ah, clearly.
