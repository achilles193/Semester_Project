(LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:03:57) Spring Break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I thought I was going to go away so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t, I canceled the session this last week. And this friend of mine, like I guess high school friend from Nepal, he said, \u201cOh, you should come visit me in (inaudible at 00:04:25)\u201d and he like bought a ticket for me and stuff. (LAUGHTER) But <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">like almost a month before my trip, like we lost touch. Like he would Skype like every day. It was like... (LAUGHTER) He was like a pest. You know? Like just as I was getting down to my work, he would ping me and insist that I talk to him and I\u2019d talk for like half an hour sometimes, you know, longer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(PAUSE) I mean, I guess I thought I was getting something out of that as well. But it really felt like, you know, like a burden on my time. Just as I\u2019m about to start writing, he\u2019s pinging me and it\u2019s like... If I let myself get annoyed, it\u2019s really annoying. (LAUGHTER) But I was like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">I guess. You have to be there for people. This is how you build friendships and relationships. Blah, blah, blah.\u201d (inaudible at 00:05:37) concerned about stuff. But... So yeah. He bought me a ticket and stuff. And I was like, \u201cReally? Should I really do this? I haven\u2019t really spent much time with him <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">and actually...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I mean, we\u2019ve known each other for a very long time. But like... (PAUSE) I didn\u2019t really spend that much time with him. (PAUSE) So it was a bit weird. I mean, I felt weird about the idea, you know, going all the way to (inaudible at 00:06:19) just to visit some guy that, you know, is for, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">practical purposes is kind of a stranger. And I guess I didn\u2019t end up going. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. We kind of lost touch. He stopped pinging me. Like two days before the flight, I was like, \u201cHey. I\u2019m still coming.\u201d (LAUGHTER) Like a day later, he\u2019s like, \u201cSomething bad has happened at work and I think we\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">cancel the trip for now.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d But, you know, I was like really hurt. Or hurt as in more like, you know, like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I canceled everything for this, that week and... So it\u2019s just... It sounds more foolish than anything else. I\u2019m just sitting around in D.C.. (LAUGHTER) I mean, I could have made my own plans as soon as that fell through. But I didn\u2019t. (LAUGHTER) Like I was supposed to fly out on Saturday and I heard <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">from him on Friday. It\u2019s just like... This is no way to treat a friend. You know? Especially someone you\u2019ve been pinging every single day and been very kind of open with and friendly. Right? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Did you think to talk about it before in here? You were thinking about going and not sure and feeling ambivalent? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Did I think to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Did you think about talking about it in here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t... It wasn\u2019t on my mind then. I hadn\u2019t brought it up. Right? Or I had?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: No. I just think there are so many instances where you tell me about things after the fact. But things leading up to it, you know, that it\u2019s clear that what\u2019s going on before something happens could be helpful to talk about and think about together. But you don\u2019t. And it\u2019s sort of almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">mysterious. It\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going out of the country.\u201d It\u2019s very mysterious. You didn\u2019t actually tell me anything about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562646\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: And then clearly it\u2019s complicated. You\u2019re not really sure if you\u2019re going to go. But you don\u2019t really talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: And I guess I\u2019m wondering why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not prepared. Like I don\u2019t prepare for things. (LAUGHTER) I guess that... This is a sign of that. I didn\u2019t really want to think about it. I didn\u2019t want it to occupy much of my time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I didn\u2019t really like this guy. I was kind of mean to him and very mean to him because he liked me and I didn\u2019t like him back. I felt that was such a burden on me. Like I felt like he was asking something of me that I really couldn\u2019t give. And that really made me feel burdened or, you know, like... Yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">So I was mean to him. Like this was I guess when he was in the U.S. I was in Ohio and he was in Pittsburgh. It was 2006. (PAUSE) Yeah. But like since last year, we were, we became friends again. That is we just spoke on the phone and stuff. (PAUSE) And... (PAUSE) Like I didn\u2019t really think much of it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">of him, of the trip. So I didn\u2019t really want to think about it. I guess I was in denial or I was like, \u201cOh, this is too weird for me to think about. Maybe if I don\u2019t think about it, it\u2019ll go away.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Go away, not as in like not happen. But go away as in like it won\u2019t be such a big deal. I didn\u2019t want to make it a big deal. I guess that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bring it up here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well, what does a big deal mean? What (inaudible at 00:10:29).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I guess it... You know, occupied with it or preoccupied with it or you\u2019re thinking about it constantly. I don\u2019t really know. I have a very weird... (PAUSE) ...understanding of thinking itself. (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t really understand (inaudible at 00:10:51). (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Feeling ambivalent or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">confused about the process of thinking itself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(PAUSE) Like what is thinking versus what is over thinking or what is planning versus going with the flow or... You know? (PAUSE) Yeah. (LAUGHTER) Sounds like a very basic human thing like breathing. But... (PAUSE) I guess if you had to be confused about breathing, you could be confused about that too. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">Like what is breathing? Are you supposed to breathe from your nose or your mouth or your diaphragm? You know? (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) What was the initial question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Why you didn\u2019t bring it up in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Oh no. What was your second question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Hmm... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">(PAUSE) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems like something you\u2019re trying to make a decision about that\u2019s not clear to you is something that certainly people bring up in therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it\u2019s... It wasn\u2019t as big of a deal. I feel like I was dealing with bigger things. It just... I just was like a low priority for me. (PAUSE) I mean, I was like, \u201cReally? Is this really happening? No one\u2019s ever bought...\u201d Chris (ph) has bought tickets for me. But that was (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">at 00:12:51). Has he? No, no. That... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">Yeah, if I was in Nepal, he\u2019d buy tickets for me because he has a bank account there or a credit card. Yeah. So it never happened like someone buying me like a thousand dollar plane ticket. (LAUGHTER) So I was really like baffled by it and like, \u201cYeah. Okay, you have a lot of money or a nice job. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">why are you doing this? What does this mean?\u201d It was too much. I didn\u2019t really think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562646\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Too much... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Just too much. Yeah, I mean, too much (inaudible at 00:13:35). Unusual. Unprecedented. I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) You\u2019re saying that normal people... (LAUGHTER) Not normal people but... I could have talked to you about this and prepared myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm hmm. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: (SIGH) Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Not only that but it\u2019s almost mysterious...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: How little you said is striking too. Usually, people go away for a week, they just say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going here.\u201d They say something even if they\u2019re not talking to me about the decision. They tell me where they\u2019re going. So there was like something mysterious... \u201cI\u2019ll be out of the country.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: So little was said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Well, so if I had bought the ticket, I was planning the trip, I would have had much more agency and active, I would have actively participated and actively thought about it. But I felt so passive in this scenario. You know, the ticket was bought for me already. All I had to do was print it out, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">pack a bag, take my passport and go to the airport. You know? (LAUGHTER) I mean, that is like surreal to me. That\u2019s not happened. And I didn\u2019t really believe that it was, this was real, you know, this was for real. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">And, you know, come Friday when I got his message, I was just like... It was almost like, \u201cOh, I knew all along this was just a joke.\u201d You know? So... (PAUSE) In a way, I\u2019m glad that my unpreparedness prepared me for it. You know what I mean? Like if I had really thought about it, if I had prepared, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">if I had my bag ready like several days in advance and, you know, looked up places in Qatar (ph), and, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to this place. I\u2019m going to see this mosque, eat there,\u201d then I would have been really disappointed. You know? I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I don\u2019t know this guy. I was... I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">feel like I was right in not trusting him such that I was only depressed for like day or two when I realized that he let me down. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">For whatever reason, you know, things beyond his control... I feel like my unpreparedness was the right thing to do. (LAUGHTER) And I\u2019m not defending myself. I\u2019m like just now thinking about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Well, but you canceled the sessions. You must have arranged some parts of your schedule to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I did. Yeah. I canceled a tea with my professor that I\u2019ve been trying to arrange for the last three months. That I was really upset about. (LAUGHTER) But... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t prepare at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I feel like, you know, anticipation would have made it a lot worse. (PAUSE) I mean, I prepared by canceling meetings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">It was different than anticipating things. (PAUSE) Well, I could say that I wanted to be pleasantly surprised. I just was unpleasantly surprised. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, but you weren\u2019t sure if you wanted to go. Part of why he maybe sort of dropped it is because he felt you weren\u2019t interested. He may have been responding to you. If you were presenting to him that you were eager and excited, he may not have said what he did on Friday. So it\u2019s not... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">It wasn\u2019t just him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562646\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s fine. You know, I don\u2019t really want to invest in that way in that friendship. You know? It\u2019s really like weird for me to go to somewhere so far away and not know practically anyone except him and his roommate. You know? I would have been staying in an apartment with two strange guys <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">in a strange country. So, in a way, I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t happen. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So why say yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: I feel like I didn\u2019t really have a choice. He just kind of sent me a ticket and I was like, \u201cWait. I told you that I cannot afford to do this right now.\u201d He was like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money. Just enjoy your break.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d And (inaudible at 00:18:25) I guess I\u2019ll see what happens. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">I feel like I don\u2019t really have agency or I don\u2019t allow myself to take agency in certain matters. I guess I would like to work on that. No, I know I would like to. But, I mean, another thing I wanted to like say about this was it\u2019s kind of sad that I don\u2019t anticipate. (LAUGHTER) In the sense that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">know anticipation is to me, like 90% of the pleasure of any situation. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">So it\u2019s kind of sad (LAUGHTER) this this, like I go through life like this. I mean, I should say I go through life like this. But, you know, like... (PAUSE) It\u2019s a simple joy. And like I think I would be much more engaged and alive and active and have agency if I allowed myself to anticipate or, as <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">you said, you know, like bring it up and talk about it (LAUGHTER) and think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Well, make a decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. Even before the decision making. Like be actively thinking and be actively present. Like how hard would it have been for me to kind of like allow myself to think when he says, \u201cCome to Qatar,\u201d me thinking, \u201cOkay. This is (inaudible at 00:20:15) ground level reality. Me in a strange apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">with strange guys in a strange country. I don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">I could have just said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d or, you know, \u201cLet\u2019s meet up in (LAUGHTER) some neutral space.\u201d (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) I\u2019m changing slowly. I feel I am trying to actively think in some scenarios and plan and, you know, not just react. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">(PAUSE) But I guess I just like to keep going (LAUGHTER) keep doing this and improving as a planner. (PAUSE) Yeah. I keep telling everyone, Chris and so on, \u201cWhat is this? Like why is this guy completely incommunicado? I don\u2019t understand anything, you know, like if what he\u2019s saying, what happened at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">work is really the truth or if something else is going on.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">I have no... I feel totally clueless. Like do I trust him? Do I not trust him? How do I feel about this? And I don\u2019t know. And then I\u2019m just like, \u201cLeave it. Forget about it. (LAUGHTER) I can\u2019t really do anything about it.\u201d You know? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You know, (inaudible at 00:22:45) reminds me of the situation you were in last summer with that old guy. I mean, obviously the situations are very different. But I\u2019m trying to figure out what the similarity is. The similarity seems to me like, \u201cYou know, this doesn\u2019t feel quite right. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">not really sure what\u2019s going on.\u201d You know, like... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562646\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">And, at that point, rather than talking about it with someone and trying to understand what you\u2019re feeling, how you\u2019re feeling by reflect the situation and then starting to really anchor yourself and think about it and then maybe make a decision based on it or not, like you\u2019re just kind of like, \u201cWell, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">let\u2019s just... We\u2019ll just ignore it. We\u2019ll forget it and maybe it\u2019ll go away.\u201d And then something happens and it\u2019s... I mean, in this case, it\u2019s, nothing terrible happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s kind of the same process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. It is. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">(PAUSE) I mean, I feel confused about him too as like a friend or whatever. I mean, yeah. So I don\u2019t really know what I should feel about him and how I should respond to his Skype calls or like, and then, you know, the ticket or... Yeah. I guess I should have talked about it. (LAUGHTER) Or even just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">allowed myself to rationally think about it. (PAUSE) With some situations, you can\u2019t really ignore. (LAUGHTER) I feel like I\u2019ll ignore it and then it\u2019ll just go away. But... (PAUSE) I guess that doesn\u2019t happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: And then there\u2019s your feelings which you shouldn\u2019t ignore either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: The feelings you have about the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Like how do you mean in this scenario?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, he\u2019s annoying you. You\u2019re not really sure what to do. But then you should feel like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s how friendships are built by being sort of flexible.\u201d But you\u2019re having all these feelings that you\u2019re trying to sort out and that are confusing to you and that\u2019s one of the reasons <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">that you\u2019re coming to see me so I can help you with those experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don\u2019t... I was confused about that whole thing. Like some... I remember several instances where I was really annoyed. Like I was just about to start writing and he\u2019s Skyping and I was like... I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">I, you know, thought, \u201cOkay. Just one more two minutes.\u201d And then, you know, we ended up talking for half an hour and every five minutes, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d But he\u2019s like, \u201cNo. Let\u2019s talk more. Just five more minutes.\u201d And to me that was like really annoying where I feel trapped. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">You know, I feel like... It\u2019s not my annoyance... It\u2019s not like a powerful kind of, you know, big man getting angry. It\u2019s me, like a little kind of internalizing my annoyance and feeling trapped and feeling victimized kind of. You know, that\u2019s how my annoyance manifests itself or how I experience it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">But... (PAUSE) I didn\u2019t really know what to do about it. You know? Because I felt obliged because he had bought me a ticket. So I guess I was talking to him more out of a sense of obligation. You know? (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">(PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) And like how do you figure that out? Like when someone is kind of not respecting your time versus they\u2019re just kind of genuinely in need or like they\u2019re genuinely... I mean, they don\u2019t mean to disrespect. They\u2019re just... (PAUSE) Yeah. They\u2019re just in need. You know? Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">Darren (ph) can be like that. He\u2019s very... He needs attention a lot. But I feel like if I tell him, \u201cNo, I really need to go and work,\u201d I think he listens. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562646\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It seems like there\u2019s your answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Well, you were saying that Darren is in need but, in the end, he respects what you have to say versus just pushing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: And there\u2019s not any sort of very clear categories. It probably exists on a continuum. But it seems like there\u2019s one end of the continuum or the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a little bit the way you describe your gay friend. I\u2019m calling him your gay friend because it\u2019s easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But, you know, \u201cJust a little bit more. Let me just... I just need a little bit more of your help.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. He is... He\u2019s getting like that. Like yesterday also, he kept pinging, \u201cLet\u2019s go watch this movie.\u201d I kept saying, \u201cNo, no, no. Some other time.\u201d (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I\u2019m new to this where... Maybe I\u2019m not new. But I feel like it feels new this whole thing of people wanting my attention, my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">help, my time and me trying to figure out like how much of myself I can give to them.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">Like this gay friend (LAUGHTER) he really took a lot of time this, during this break. You know, and I regret some of that time. But not too much, I guess. I feel like I still kind of... (PAUSE) I mean, I didn\u2019t meet my target but I don\u2019t want to think of it that way because I am continuing to write. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: You are continuing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Like I have the momentum still from this break in terms of like writing. And so... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">How much time do we have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: We have over ten minutes. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: I wanted to kind of bring up something else so, you know, we can talk about it and I can prepare. (LAUGHTER) So I\u2019m looking for jobs and I don\u2019t... I want to understand exactly why I\u2019m looking for whatever and like what will be the, what will make most sense for me. (PAUSE) This is a critical <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">time for me. I have good momentum on my book and I want to finish and I got into that program that, you know, that people work on their novels for a whole year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Congratulations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Thank you. It\u2019s very expensive actually. (LAUGHTER) But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: What program is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: It\u2019s with this writing place in D.C. and they take in like ten students and we\u2019re all working on their novels. It\u2019s very expensive but I got their scholarship so it\u2019s by half. But it\u2019s still like $4,000. (LAUGHTER) So I... And I won\u2019t get, I won\u2019t have any money coming in over the summer because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">at school that\u2019s how they do it. So I was thinking, you know, what kind of jobs I could do. And... (PAUSE) And partly, like when I was applying, I mostly applied this past week when I was supposed to be on Spring Break. I think like the motivation kind of came from a place of panic a little bit. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD2\">know. Because I thought that I was going to be in Qatar and, you know, like (PAUSE) part of the reason to go was to feel kind of, you know, taken care of by a friend and, you know, I was going to ask him for a little bit of money because he had already like offered. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">I don\u2019t know why I was going to do that. But not that I cannot pay the whole tuition myself but I still have this sense of panic and motivation because I\u2019m not... (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t have a full time job. I don\u2019t know. So... (PAUSE) I just want to understand like why am I looking for jobs and, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">I don\u2019t want to end up taking a full time job and feel trapped and then again at a time when I really am... I should focus on my book and, you know, keep going, keep kind of, keep the momentum going and kind of continue to live poorly, not poorly but, you know, like the way that I\u2019m doing right now. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562646\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">(PAUSE) Yeah. (LAUGHTER) I hope I don\u2019t end up making a mistake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re... When does the program start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: In May.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And is that in addition to going to school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I wanted to drop out but people are like, \u201cNo.\u201d And then like maybe I should have one more year. So... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And so you want to get a part time position while you\u2019re doing this or a full time... What are your thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I guess I have to just look at my time commitments. But if I don\u2019t... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have any, I\u2019ll have the (SIGH) university job in the summer. So... (PAUSE) I\u2019ll be pretty... I\u2019ll have more time from May, mid-May to like September. So I\u2019m wondering what I should do. If I should temp or if I should do waitressing. I have no experience in that. (LAUGHTER) Chris is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">like, \u201cYou should do something that you already have experience in and stuff.\u201d So... (PAUSE) I even took this fitness training program yesterday. (LAUGHTER) It\u2019s like a dance program. But it\u2019s also a very... I\u2019m like... I\u2019m so sore right now. I don\u2019t know why I felt I could do it. But maybe I can. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">(PAUSE) So I\u2019m trying out different things to see what is the best thing for me. And I\u2019m... (PAUSE) I\u2019m interviewing with this place for a full time job that I feel like I don\u2019t know. Can I really do this? It\u2019s in a completely new industry. (PAUSE) But I feel like... I can\u2019t really understand... I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">anticipate or predict if I will be happy doing that and I\u2019ll come back, you know, from a nine to five job still feeling I could write or if that\u2019s a totally ridiculous idea and I should not have, not do that at all, not do any job or do something that, you know, (PAUSE) brings in money but maybe money <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">is not that important. It\u2019s also important to kind of keep feeling kind of positive and motivated and confident. So like if I could find a job that makes me feel that way, then it\u2019ll also fuel into my writing or... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">I mean, I don\u2019t want to do something that completely drains me and stresses me out and I don\u2019t want to do anything but, you know, veg in front of a TV which is what I felt like, you know, two, three years ago when I was doing full time work. (PAUSE) So... (PAUSE) I\u2019m thinking about this. I hope I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">(LAUGHTER) I come up with the right solution and not, you know, make a decision out of panic or starvation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Can you do the full time job and school as well? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: (SIGH) I don\u2019t know what school will look like.

(LAUGHTER) I guess just looking to you to ask if it\u2019s considered bad. (PAUSE) Or in the professional field, look at something and say, \u201cOh, well you dropped out.\u201d But I don\u2019t think I have to put that in my resume at all. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: I mean, I guess it gets... One of the thing it gets down to is how does one make decisions about things that are thoughtful and (inaudible at 00:38:35)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. How do you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: By thinking about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Am I thinking about it correct? At least in this job thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re trying to think about it, it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like the guy in Qatar was a little bit tied up with money like maybe he\u2019d give you some money to help with this new program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I was talking to him about it and I was like, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s expensive.\u201d He was like, \u201cOh, just give me a heads up and for that much amount of money, I need some heads up. If it\u2019s little, then you can just ask me.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWait. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to ask you. But, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">if you\u2019re offering.\u201d (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) No, I think that\u2019s... I should... I shouldn\u2019t panic. I shouldn\u2019t feel like I need to ask people for money. I have... You know, I can pay the whole thing myself. I shouldn\u2019t... I just have this in the back of my head that, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have a job and my mom\u2019s rent <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201072\">is also kind of there and my situation.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">So, financially, I\u2019m not doing too well and therefore I, I\u2019m looking to others. And I think that\u2019s like a bad scene to be in. You know? So I shouldn\u2019t do that. I should stop feeling that way and try and feel more empowered. One thing is feeling. The other thing is the actual, you know, ground level <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201091\">reality. Material conditions... So if having a full time job makes me feel more empowered, do I make sure I do it or, at this time, you know, like... Whatever takes time away from writing... I mean, it will. But more importantly will it be too much stress and make me not write at all. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">So I feel like the only way to find out is to take up a job and see. And if it doesn\u2019t work, then I quit which is really bad if I quit in a week or two weeks or a month. But then what can you do? You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Well, if you quit that soon, you didn\u2019t really give it a chance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: I mean, what can you know in two weeks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Sometimes with a job, you, it takes, you have to put a lot more effort in initially just because you\u2019re learning the job and it may take a lot less effort and energy, you know, a few months in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: But if you take a job and you go, \u201cI can always quit in two weeks,\u201d I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it to take the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know, which is why I\u2019m looking at part time options. (PAUSE) But I don\u2019t make a convincing waitress. I make even less convincing as a waitress than I am as something I\u2019m qualified to do. It\u2019s like, \u201cReally?\u201d Anyone can do that. But apparently not because people look on your resume and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B1\">they don\u2019t see any waitressing experience. So...

Will you have as many classes next year as you do this year because you\u2019re in class a lot this year. It would be hard to imagine you having a nine to five job when you\u2019re in class a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m not in class a lot even now. It\u2019s Tuesdays, there\u2019s class during the, you know, afternoons and then another class on Wednesday nights. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">THERAPIST: I see.
