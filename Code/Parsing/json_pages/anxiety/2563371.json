I\u2019ve been talking about my tattoo in the past that I want to get done. I want to get it done without Ginny knowing about it so it\u2019s a surprise. It\u2019s tricky. If you look into the pattern, more and more I think this is a cool pattern, but it\u2019s four tattoos <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">and the one section, you kind of do that on one section. [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:58) The young lady told me that after three hours endorphins stop. Your body stops making endorphins, so I guess the natural pain sets in. She said we could probably get this done in three hours. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d But also <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">she was saying that the last one hurts a bit. That actually makes sense thematically, though. We\u2019re starting with the sternum, so that\u2019s the worst of it. That\u2019s directly on it. Even the spine is not that bad. You go right over the bridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: It needs to be done in one session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: That should be a surprise. The other lady is like, \u201cYou\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while. These concepts are important to you. You should just go ahead and do this: go get it drawn out and spell-checked by a named speaker so you can bring it back and I can draw anything.\u201d I\u2019ve done this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">sort of thing before. Also, she\u2019s a woman and she\u2019s younger. I think the idea of getting a tattoo is an intimate one and, therefore, not one I would want to share with a man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It would be better with a woman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s easier to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: They say it\u2019s an intimate thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s easier to do with women than men. If it weren\u2019t, I think I\u2019d be in for a long spectrum because it\u2019s almost like duality. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s where I am with that. Men are difficult. Men are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Something that up close and personal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I prefer hugging gay men over straight men. You can hug gay men. They\u2019ll hug you right back. It\u2019s like you can hug a woman and they\u2019ll hug you right back. Some of the dudes evolve into the [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:30) hug. We clasp hands and pull each other in, shoulder-punch each other in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">heart and slap each other on the back. It\u2019s aggressive; it\u2019s conflict. What\u2019s wrong with this? Can\u2019t we just hug like regular people? You\u2019re the odd man out. You\u2019re the straight male. You\u2019re one of the four basic types that can\u2019t hug. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: The straight man\u2019s fear of tenderness or something with another man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It\u2019s compulsive indoctrination into male dominance. Pete was knocked down a couple of years ago and he was talking about alphas with this woman, Felicity. (sp?). She said a woman could get strong. She was like, \u201cRah. High life. Rah.\u201d She gets all super aggressive. She\u2019s smart basically and is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">snarky the rest of the time. I don\u2019t particularly care for her. I don\u2019t know if I could get her back in a fight. It depends on if she started it or not. If she started it, I\u2019m probably just going to stand back and call the police. (pause)  She\u2019s walking by and talking about people and was talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">[ ] (inaudible at [0:05:04] walking by and hear her say, \u201cI was planning on giving him to Fred today, but Fred is not out.\u201d Pete is like, \u201cFred is the most beta alpha I know.\u201d I stopped and I\u2019m like, \u201cHey, guys. Let\u2019s just talk about alphas.\u201d Pete is like, \u201cthis is the most beta alpha I know. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">totally calm and polite when you talk about things until you stab someone in the face.\u201d Right. You can be alpha without being an asshole about it. It\u2019s like when you turn on [] (sp?) and he can do shit. That\u2019s being an alpha.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563371\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I can have an exterior that looks calm, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have that in me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. Why would you show that the entire time? [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:55) Besides, being alpha when you have to, there is a cost every time you\u2019re alpha. Nobody likes to be alpha. They want to follow the alpha. They want to follow the alpha like crazy. They don\u2019t want to be alpha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the cost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: The cost is, very slowly over time, fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: The more you become the alpha?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: They start to become afraid of you. Fear leads to resentment; resentment leads to contempt. Contempt is [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:39) . This is what happens with alphas who alpha all day. Like Josh and Orlando and those guys. \u201cAlpha, alpha, alpha! Alpha, alpha!\u201d All your programmers hate you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">They dread when you come into the office.  Productivity and morale take a serious dip every time you guys are fucking here. That\u2019s the trouble with working from home. They just don\u2019t know how to alpha. That\u2019s the thing, he tries to stare me down. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to alpha you down.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">can\u2019t, though.\u201d That\u2019s not actually something I worry about \u2013 unless you\u2019re going to try to physically strike me. Even then I\u2019m not terribly worried about it. One, because that\u2019s illegal and two, it\u2019s not going to be a pleasant experience. (sighs) You start to be more concerned when someone is significantly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">bigger, like bigger range. Pretty soon you have to start thinking about it. This is the same sort of thing that alphas think, this sort of mass. It\u2019s an emotional mental mass you can exert.  I wish I could tell this to my lead so that you create your own authority. I\u2019m not sure everyone can actually do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But there is a danger of being an alpha, that it\u2019s almost like a tool that you can\u2019t use too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Right. Alpha is a fucking sledgehammer. It\u2019s like now things are going to happen the way I want. They\u2019re going to happen in the following way . . . Now if you alpha correctly, just by showing that in the middle of a crisis you can stand there and be calm and tell everyone what to do \u2013 especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">when everyone wants to be told what to do because it\u2019s a crisis. Please tell us what to do. I can tell you what to do and I\u2019m not freaking out. You may notice I\u2019m one of the few people not freaking out, so come on by. That\u2019s when people appreciate an alpha.  (laugh) As [] (ph?) once said, \u201cFred has <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">the best Jesus voice I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d It\u2019s just a funny way of him saying it\u2019s really calm, soothing, like it\u2019s all going to be fine. I realize everything is exploding right now, but we have tasks we can do that can fix that; so we\u2019re just going to do them. A lot of them start telling kids, I\u2019ve noticed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">over the years, all new people have the same sort of fire in them. They\u2019re like, \u201c[ ] (inaudible at [0:09:33] this program. [ ] does everything. This is being done this way. I can\u2019t believe this is being done this way. Yesterday you said were doing this and now we\u2019re doing this.\u201d Some of them I sat <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200314\">down and I\u2019m like, \u201cTeam, every day the plan is going to change. Every single day. We\u2019re going to do our best to predict what happens tomorrow, but really we\u2019re going to deal with whatever happens today. And we can do that because we are smart and we are adaptive and that is why I hired all of you.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563371\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: But these out-of-control eruptions . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. If you just deal with that, the plan is going to change. We\u2019re going to make the plan one day and the next day we\u2019ll have to alter that plan because something else has changed. We can\u2019t be rigid; we have to be fluid. That\u2019s what a QA is. It\u2019s true for the amount of productivity you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">have, but there is a great deal with reactionary; movement is necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve got to act, but you\u2019ve also got to react.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes. And put in measures to make sure you\u2019re looking far enough ahead. Include things that should break. Also be ready to adapt when things that shouldn\u2019t break do break \u2013 or when new things break everything. Change the way you have to go about everything else. So often you build it and they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">like, \u201cWe can\u2019t get into this mode.\u201d I\u2019ll be like, \u201cAh, but we can if we change the website address to this. We can get into this mode and test that mode.\u201d  It\u2019s not as legitimate, but we can find our way around and, honestly, it\u2019s likely fine. Most things I worry about never happen anyway, but that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">the key to a person\u2019s job, worry about everything. And if much of it doesn\u2019t happen it\u2019s fantastic, but we were thinking about it and being prepared for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It comes natural to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it does. It does. Step one, people want to be led \u2013 which is different than people want to be told what to do. There are cases in which people want to be told what to do, those moments when they are afraid, like when they\u2019re afraid and they\u2019re unsure and they lack confidence in themselves. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">And so you just give it to them, right?  It\u2019s amazing how easy it is to give a younger person confidence. (pause) it\u2019s a seduction technique. It\u2019s the same thing. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of this thing.\u201d Okay, you need to calm down because you can do this and here are the reasons you can do this. With the qualities <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">you have we think you\u2019re qualified to do this and these are some of the reasons I hired you, so you can do this. Then they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d All they want to know is you see something. You\u2019ve chosen them particularly because it\u2019s something that they can do. I like that very much. That\u2019s very fulfilling. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D3\">Here\u2019s something about yourself that you didn\u2019t realize \u2013 and it\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t just see all the ways you\u2019re broken. I see all the ways in which you\u2019re perfect.  That takes more time, [but there are elements of it that begin that flash and sparkle] (ph?) There is a sense of permanence. A sense of permanence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">These are ideals for which I\u2019ve striven for many years now \u2013 at least ten, if not 12 or 13. It\u2019s a concept. The concept of getting tattooed and struggling with it for years now, five years now. There is going to be some sort of dragon hole and some sort of protective symbol right about here over my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">heart. I\u2019ve got those symbols in my life. I have the symbols in meaningful ways. The thing about the problem with harmonics, it became clear that I liked dragons, and so suddenly I was surrounded by dragons. So I had to say . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563371\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: No more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, no more dragons. I don\u2019t like dragons so you will get me dragons. I like these particular dragons. They have meaning or symbolism, therefore those are the ones I chose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Almost like you were invaded by this storm of dragons given to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, and people are like, \u201cI know you like this stuff.\u201d I do, but I don\u2019t like it for you to like it. It\u2019s not a way to share something with me, which is probably what you intended. It\u2019s some way to share. I\u2019m offering you something that you like. I got it for you because I thought you would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">like it. I was thinking of you. I appreciate that. I really do, but I don\u2019t want more dragons. The ones that I have, I choose.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Kent Hovind\u2019s argument against evolution that dinosaurs did live alongside man. It\u2019s just that in those days they called them dragons, a whole variety of animals clumped together as dragons. He\u2019s a young earth creationist. He\u2019s a fucking idiot. There is no excuse. I\u2019m sorry. There is no excuse. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">The tattoo, a sense of permanence. The last thing I want to do \u2013 because it\u2019s awkward. The things that I hold special, I do not share what they are. Those are my things.  They\u2019re not there to be shared. Tattooing makes them more a part of me. People will be curious about it and I don\u2019t want to talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">about that. But it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s unreadable; it\u2019s Hebrew. People who read Hebrew will be like, \u201cOh. This is that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Is that right? It\u2019s Hebrew?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s what that says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: And they\u2019ll be able to see it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Eventually. This will be here; this will be here. It\u2019s on the back of the spine and on this arm, roughly the same height all the way around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: So they might not be able to see it except for certain sides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. Over a whole area. Exactly. But when it\u2019s there, if people want to talk about it that\u2019s one thing. I think that might be one thing. That might be empowering, that sort of attention. Like what does this mean? What are these? These are special to me.  They have meaning and symbolism that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">I don\u2019t talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t mean I want to tell you all about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Really. I talked to the tattoo artist. She was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell anybody anything.\u201d My thinking is like someone might argue that if you put something on your body and, therefore, I can comment on it. Well, should I comment on your face? Because I can go right down a list of flaws <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">right now. (laughs) Is that what we should do? You\u2019re fairly symmetrical so you have less to worry about. In this case, the people I\u2019m thinking of are less so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: A face you can trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: I suppose. I mean it\u2019s built that way, right? It\u2019s built into our DNA somewhere. It\u2019s like the study where if you say I\u2019m sorry before you make the request for perfect strangers who are much more likely to acquiesce to the request.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: If you say I\u2019m sorry? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: There was a study they did. They sent a bunch of different people into the subways and train platforms. They walked up to a stranger and asked if they could borrow their cell phone. 100% rejection rate. No one is going to fucking give their cell phone to a stranger. Are you insane? They sent <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">other people down and they started off by apologizing for something random, like \u201csorry about this snow today.\u201d And then were like, \u201cHey, can I borrow your cell phone?\u201d Much more likely. Much more likely. Only like a 70% turn down rate; but 30% of people were like, \u201cOh, yeah. Sure,\u201d if they were apologizing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200632\">for anything. There were some other studies they were linking to.  They were like, \u201cThis is interesting.\u201d Just saying you\u2019re sorry makes people more likely to trust you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563371\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: Saying that puts somebody a little bit more in the trust circle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Right. And these are the tricks you have to know. You have to learn how these things work. When someone says \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d you\u2019re inherently more likely to trust them, so be wary of whatever they ask next. If someone holds\/shakes your hand for six seconds, like \u201clet\u2019s shake hands,\u201d six seconds <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">is enough time to release oxytocin in both your bodies, making you more likely to trust them and vice versa. At the end of the trick, again, beware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: It can be used as a tool, something that\u2019s going to get you to agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s all a tool. They\u2019re all tools, Carl, right? Anything that can be manipulated is a tool.  If that\u2019s emotions, if that\u2019s thought, if that\u2019s mass, if that\u2019s energy . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Closeness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes.

Exactly. What is this purpose for? That\u2019s the thing. They always say if you can fake sincerity, you\u2019ve got it made. No, if you can create sincerity, though, that\u2019s even better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you can really get in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Even with business, like I\u2019m saying \u201cthat\u2019s sweet.\u201d As far as I can tell, being sweet is saying true things that are nice. That\u2019s what being sweet is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: I can make it synthetically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I can synthesize sincerity. That\u2019s the secret for any sincerity, isn\u2019t it? The trade-off is the same.  I will be intimate with you in a subjective way, just to worry about truth. No big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I wanted to ask you about the meeting with Ginny on Monday because I had been thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Is it problematic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s not problematic, but I did want to make sure that you felt . . . I had this growing feeling that I was doing it with some idea in mind that what I thought was helpful at the time, I\u2019m not sure it will be, necessarily, mostly because I thought it would be helpful for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s more helpful for her, which is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: I realize it\u2019s also impeding on your space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: I just want to do it in a way that \u2013 this is for you.

I guess I\u2019ve been thinking about it and wondering if that\u2019s how it\u2019s really going to go.

I guess I kind of found myself thinking I was convincing myself that it was a good idea for you and then I was thinking that I don\u2019t think you told me that it was a good idea for you. I think I had it abstractly that it\u2019s good for couples to do this. And that is true. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">it can be true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, man. Who knows when the next time I\u2019m going to go into some sort of depressive swing, though? Who knows? Who has any idea when that\u2019s going to happen next? It happens. It\u2019s happened for many years. It happens. It\u2019s part of who I am. It\u2019s part of the as-good-as-it-gets state.

It\u2019s more like is this really going to be for you or not? I guess I just want to throw that out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Sure.

That\u2019s true. I will talk with her tonight and see what she thinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: How are you feeling? Maybe a better way to put it, too, is what do you think of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m also curious what will come of it. I do think it\u2019s largely for her.

Who also suggested perhaps she come here and we talk \u2013 Ginny, not her psychologist. Ginny is just concerned that I\u2019ll kill myself at some point.  She sort of wants permission to bring certain people into the circle when I\u2019m in that mood. I think that\u2019s what she wants, to negotiate who she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">can talk to and who can she reach out to if I\u2019m having one of these episodes? She knows I\u2019m intensely private. It never occurred to me that she has no one to talk to. [I told her she can talk to Darcy.] (ph?) I don\u2019t know. Maybe the worst is past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Would that be useful to negotiate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like I can negotiate that with her if that\u2019s what she wants. Like I said, I had a down day and I used every resource except for Ginny.  I used every resource except for you. You don\u2019t have to worry about me; but maybe she does and maybe there are better ways I can interact <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">with her to make those things known. I\u2019m not sure what they would be. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll talk to her. But the tattoo has been weighing on my mind heavily \u2013 the permanence. [It\u2019s a long permanence.] (ph?) While it\u2019s partially taking something that\u2019s important to me and making it permanent.  Like I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF2\">it also puts it out on display for other people which leaves it open to be challenged or questioned or judged \u2013 assigned value to. It even can be assumed. It\u2019s also power and attention and mystery. He has this tattoo. Is he Petetian? Is he Jewish? I\u2019m none of these things. Then why Hebrew? I don\u2019t talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF3\">about them. Those are the questions. I don\u2019t talk about them.  I can tell you where I got them done and who did them if you want to go. She\u2019s good. Clearly. This is it. I don\u2019t talk about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563371\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Is there some importance, though, for it to be displayed, not necessarily talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:26)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Emblazoned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s something that I care deeply about, something that has a lot of meaning to me, symbolism, ideals, things to keep in mind, cycles to remember. There is a lot wrapped up in it. There is a lot wrapped up in it and I kept them very, very, very, very, very private for a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B71\">long time.  Part of it is to show this to Ginny and be like we\u2019ll never even talk about these, but they\u2019re on me.

It\u2019s for me, but yes, there will be a benefit for her. This is a secondary thing. That\u2019s another reason to go ahead with it. My biggest fear is in perfection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: In the actual?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: In the actual art itself. I have a very specific idea of what I want. She has good practice in this form, so let\u2019s get a speaker to draw it out for me. Every one of them will end with the same three characters.

(pause) I think that makes it very interesting. (pause)  So think about it. I think it potentially will look really cool, as well. That\u2019s the thing I need to think about because I\u2019m going to see this every day. Also she mentioned to me that I\u2019ve got to rub Aveno <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C32\">into them every day to moisturize.

I did it for reasons that I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Maybe it makes it feel more yours if she doesn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: I think so. I think so. This is definitely mine.  It\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve always been very declarative about what is my space and what is mine. I don\u2019t usually yield to that position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: And if you told her, something might be affected by her reaction?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Right, or whatever. There is just information that is taken in, regardless. Regardless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: How would it change this feeling? Would it change it?

I totally broke up with Carla. Ten minutes to break up. It was my longest in a long time, in terms of severing a relationship with someone.

Off you go. Boom! Easy. Carla kept wanting to fight it. She kept wanting to make it about things I should go through in therapy <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF1\">and things I should study in therapy. She was like, \u201cAnd if I were your therapist . . .\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re not my therapist.\u201d [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:47) She\u2019s trying to do things and I\u2019m like, \u201cThe co-pay is $15, correct?\u201d She was like \u201cyeah.\u201d \u201cDo you have change for a $20?\u201d Thank you very much. Best <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF2\">of luck. She\u2019s like, \u201cI get the sense you don\u2019t want to talk anymore.\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t. It\u2019s over.\u201d I was like, \u201cI may be hooking up with Irene, the person who is your backup.\u201d She was like, \u201cOh, no. I can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d Okay, that seems kind of emotional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I suppose it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was. She was emotional. It was weakness. I don\u2019t want emotionality. It makes it too much about her. There you go. There you go. It makes it too much about her. And it was. It was this thing she wanted to go through. She was like, \u201cThis is an experience we have to have together.\u201d I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">like, \u201cI\u2019ve had it. This is done. I\u2019m done with this.\u201d I\u2019m not here to listen to your ideas about why this is happening. I\u2019m not here to listen to you condescendingly tell me that I blame the Lithium for wanting to kill myself because I can go back to the chart and be like \u201chere\u2019s how it ramps up.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201032\">She was like, \u201cDo you think you would have felt better if I had gotten back to you at some point?\u201d I went, \u201cProbably. Yeah.\u201d But that\u2019s neither here nor there. It\u2019s over. There are no second chances. There are very rarely a second chance with the Jacobs. That\u2019s not true. I would usually give you one. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201033\">I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right. You made a mistake. I understand it. Let\u2019s examine the mistake and see how it happened.\u201d If you show me with a second mistake that you\u2019re just not very good at avoiding mistakes . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: How do you feel about how it all went down for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: It was really irritating.

I just can\u2019t do that.\u201d Emotion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s emotion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: Don\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m paying for it. [ ] (inaudible at 00:44:38) I can\u2019t, huh? I\u2019m not here to listen to you about how much you hate your job. It\u2019s not on me. I\u2019m also not here for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t have to be about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not here for you, man.

I\u2019m selfish about these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: What is mine is mine and I do not share these things. These are the things that are most important to me. I keep them. It\u2019s like the blue carbuncle in Sherlock Holmes. It was a Christmas episode way back when with Jeremy Brett. There is this blue carbuncle, this precious stone, that\u2019s been passed <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201131\">back and forth, stolen and murdered for, this priceless blue carbuncle. It\u2019s currently in the possession of some very rich woman and was stolen when she was away for a few days. This whole fucked up scheme, like this Ocean\u2019s Eleven very not-smart guy makes a number of mistakes. So the blue carbuncle <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201132\">ends up in the possession of Sherlock Holmes and there is like a 1,000\u00a3 reward for it out there. It ends up with him and Watson is like, \u201cWhat are you going to do with it? He\u2019s like, \u201cI shall keep it in my museum.\u201d  He opens up this drawer where his heroine is, this picture of Irene Adler, and he tosses <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201133\">it in the drawer \u2013 this priceless stone, absolutely priceless stone. He doesn\u2019t bother to tell anyone that he solved the mystery. It doesn\u2019t matter. The stone causes a lot of trouble; now it\u2019s mine. Watson is like, \u201cBut a crime has been committed.\u201d That\u2019s when Jeremy Brett shows some of the great Sherlock <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201134\">Holmes when he rages and says, \u201cI\u2019m not employed by the police.\u201d Like I am not under contract to arrest people or send people to prison. There was a problem and I solved it. Nobody needs to go to jail. He\u2019s an idiot. The woman he stole it from, she was awful. This stone is dangerous. It\u2019s in my drawer <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201135\">now. It has no value to me other than people want it.  I\u2019m not employed by the police. I\u2019m not retained by the police. He\u2019s not currently being used by them to solve a crime. He\u2019s under no obligation to report it as far as he\u2019s concerned. It\u2019s his world. It\u2019s literally his world and everyone else is <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201136\">just living in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563371\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">I have to call back.
