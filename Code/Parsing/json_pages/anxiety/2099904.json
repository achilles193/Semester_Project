Do you would there be the possibility, any possibility for you to have might you have time like earlier in the day on Thursday and Friday?

I think it's like close to the college but mostly it seemed nice from the posting and they've got like a three year old and they do have a three month old, which is a little bit terrifying for me. But babies are like there are like four <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">things that could be wrong with them, you know.

And like the nanny jobs that I've had have been just like really, really good. Mostly in terms of I've worked for really good families and developed really close relationships with them.

I'm very picky.' You know, she's going back to work and she wants to make sure that the household routine stays exactly the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200991\">from the way it was before she went back to work. Like your six month old is not going to have his mother with him all the time. The household routine is not going to be the same. (Laugh) Like, it's going to be different. I'm not you. And she's like I want to make sure my husband isn't stressed out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200992\">about this so I need you to cook him dinner every day. That was really it for me.

We're going to the synagogue has offered <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200F11\">us space on Sunday and you know, it was a nice e-mail. It was a fine e-mail, but he like, he talked about like, 'isn't it nice that we have the chance to like worship in the home of our spiritual forebears?' And so my view is response, 'is absolutely not. Like that's not -' Jews aren't Christian spiritual <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200F12\">forebears, like this is not how it works. Like they are both drawing on the same traditions. He's basically doing the same thing that 9 out of 10 Christians do which is equate second temple Judaism with modern Judaism when they are like totally different things. Oh, I see. And the problem with that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200F13\">is then you get into like looking at Judaism as like an historical thing rather than a religion and like (unclear) and like Jews aren't really important anymore and that's not what he meant to do but, anyway, the question was whether I should send an e-mail about it which I think I'm going to just to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200F14\">like get it off my chest.

(Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20193\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20195\">CLIENT: So I say things and then wish I could take them back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20197\">THERAPIST: Because maybe actually it wasn't the thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B\">(Pause): [00:33:49 00:35:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) therapy like in the sense that I sort of look at quips and whatever as kind of how (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">CLIENT: Is this the thing of like analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Something like yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A3\">CLIENT: Have you heard that oh, Mark Twain said, \"analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.\" Something like, 'it's kind of gross and the frog dies from it.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">CLIENT: He didn't say, 'it's kind of gross I've forgotten the first half of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">CLIENT: But that was close enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF\">(Pause): [00:35:52 00:36:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B1\">THERAPIST: But part of what you're saying is that you are feeling more at ease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B5\">THERAPIST: And wary, but more at ease, first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm sure that if I'm honest with myself part of my like making fun of you is also expressing things that I'm slightly less comfortable with about therapy or talking about, you know therapy is not all wonderful all the time. But (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean that's been the gist of a lot of the kinds of things that you say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201BB\">CLIENT: And not the sort of thing that I less aware of as I'm saying it and sort of in (unclear). So, yeah. I believe you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201BD\">THERAPIST: I imagine those things go together feeling more, sort of a bit more comfortable with me and feeling like you can be kind of critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Or, more accurate to say, you can voice criticism that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C5\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk unclear). I'm actually thinking of (unclear). You may be but I (unclear) keep a log. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C9\">(Pause): [00:37:55 00:38:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB\">CLIENT: I guess it's like with priests at my church saying the same thing of my church is really important to me like being a member of my church is really important to me. It didn't matter like if I weren't a member of his congregation like I would be there sending out an e-mail in five minutes <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB1\">letting him know this is wrong and not think about it. But even that, probably, I would only say it because like it's important to me that I'm a Christian and so I feel like educating other Christians that sounds really condescending it is important to me. If I weren't Christian like I wouldn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB2\">care when people make fools of themselves. Because both it's really important for me to speak up and it would be really excruciating to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099904\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Again, like it's another way to be in a leadership or a teaching type of role where like it is my church and my classroom, like there is some equation of me like what I'm doing and what my role is (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">(Pause): [00:39:58 00:40:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">THERAPIST: And so therefore it's like to be critical or bothered about therapy is to be critical of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">(Pause): ` [00:40:15 00:40:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">CLIENT: I guess I just assume that I get the feeling that you put a lot of yourself into your job.

I think I'm pretty idealistic about thinking that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E7\">(Pause): [00:42:10 00:42:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E9\">CLIENT: I think in some ways I feel a need to think that this kind of system must be important to you.

Like yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201E91\">you see the things that are really good about it and the things that are really bad about it.
