[00:04:11.01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Okay. I feel like you neglect me sometimes and then I feel like you really take care of me at other times. I don't know that I ever really feel taken care of. I think I do in an abstract sense. [00:05:13.29] (pause) In my head I'm saying, but you talked to me on Sunday. [00:06:21.28] Like how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">could I be saying this. And then also it feels like you should talk to me on Sunday. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems to me like you're pining and off balance and feeling neglected and feeling unreasonable at the same time. [00:09:54.23] And me and I'm more or less balanced, together, not turned off, in some sense kind of out of touch then with where you're coming from. Not that I can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">hear it or wouldn't try to be reasonable and nice and compassionate about it, but it's far from the kind of [ph] my experience and you're kind of up there in the middle of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I don't know what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Hm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I don't know what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: That this is kind of what it feels like to you although I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I don't know. I think it does feel that way but not because this is not [inaudible] experience that you had. [00:11:13.29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I think I mean this is like I think what you know or what you can kind of rationally or reasonably figure out is one thing. Or your sort of actual intentions of me are one thing, in a way, and what it feels like, especially when you're in the midst of it or kind of in the heat of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">moment where you're upset, is totally different. [inaudible] not necessarily related or [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Feels like there's a lot of deliberate letting go in my head. [00:12:30.12] I don't know how what I think you are feeling or you've experienced before [inaudible] That implies that it feels like you're holding my hand at times, like that's what I really want. And maybe it happens but I forget <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">those moments. [inaudible] Again, I think I it's so the tenderness and the caring are abstract, and the neglect is a lot more concrete. In high school I used to really latch onto these songs, whatever I was listening to at the time, in response to or while working through a very charged emotional, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200392\">difficult experience. [00:15:11.17] And that's happening all the time now. (pause) [inaudible] I'm much more sad and [inaudible] this is a genre of music that derived from disco [inaudible] house [inaudible] disco and it's like hop hop it's a collage of lots of different examples from other songs <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200393\">and composed electronic sounds and synthesized electronic [inaudible] sort of dance-y. And it's like played in the clubs. We had friends who made this music in [inaudible] into it [inaudible] In high school I think it was much more empowering, angry, and comforting. (pause) I wish you would give me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200394\">more response, faster.

It's very [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I don't know. [00:20:07.22] There's something that [inaudible] there's something about the way you described the type of music that it is, the kind of amalgamated magpie-ish way that it's created. [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Jay [inaudible] (pause) I'm trying to think if I could've described it any other way. [00:22:06.16] I guess I could've. Because that's what it is; it's really quite an amalgam. It's not its own genre to anybody but the people who are in the genre. I guess I could've focused on how it feels rather <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">than the creation. It's very triumphant and sad. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't quite have it [inaudible] (pause) [inaudible] does capture pretty well how you're feeling. It might have been the way you talked about it being put together in that. Because I think what you feel seems like a sort of a confusing amalgam of the pieces of which you can kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">get ahold of, but perhaps unlike music, probably unlike music, don't fit together necessarily all that well or clearly. [00:25:21.13] You have sort of this sense of my being neglectful, letting go of your hand, not talking to you, being slow, not being patient with me, but at the same time these other <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">ways [inaudible] to say and it relates the stuff from high school and songs you used to listen to then, but it's not clear how because the mood is a little bit different and the music was different and [inaudible] it's quite unclear. It seems a little ungrounded [inaudible] in that it's not exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200473\">clear what in your experience with me or somewhere else is causing you to feel this way or [inaudible] this way. [00:26:23.17] I mean clearly you are, and clearly strongly, so it is important but it's not much clear how what you're feeling fits with what's happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: That was clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [inaudible] clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well it feels really simple, actually, right now. [00:27:10.02] It feels like I miss you all the time and I want you all the time and I'm crying out for you. And it hurts too much. And there's more you could do to give me relief. And you're not doing it. (pause) But it's not that simple most <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">of the time because I'm also trying to care for this relationship, and I think I expend a lot more energy focused on that than on how much I miss you and how it feels just that you haven't what you haven't done. Caring but it's really [inaudible] sometimes shuts me out or I ignore things about myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">in order to I don't know. It's also not [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What do [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Worrying about or thinking, it's not even worrying thinking about how it is for you and keeping in mind the longer term and your having a polar [ph] perspective that involves a lot of assumptions. [00:30:39.08] Like you have a really different perspective from me, and the longer term picture <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">is caring and tender and loving even if the day to day picture doesn't feel that way to me. Versus and simple things, like what are you going to do with that sunflower? And where are all the other flowers? If I start thinking in that way it really it's confusing and adds a lot of anxiety that obscures <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">that cause me to not think clearly about how I just wanted to give you sunflowers and [inaudible] I think it happens in a lot of my relationships. I try to get you to be in my hands more and assume that I know lots of things when really it's much easier and feels better to just realize that I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200513\">know. I don't know these things about you and I don't have to.

This is dumb, dumb that it's causing so much turmoil. Or the whole thing sometimes is dumb. Not my coming to see you, but all the other all the dirty things [inaudible] clean versus dirty. [inaudible] about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">that. Well clean pain is like the [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Arrow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: It's like when a person gets shot with an arrow there will be a lot of clean pain [inaudible] physical pain.

[00:37:03.28] Why did I get hit [inaudible] how is my life going to [inaudible] sort of we [ph] add on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">reactions that make it much worse. So all of the dirty [inaudible] things really dumb sometimes. I really don't have a lot of patience or compassion for it. [inaudible] Where the clean things here is like I miss you. [inaudible] I think that's why I'm reluctant to feel passive [inaudible] session because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">it feels so passive to be told [inaudible] If you paid attention to the last seven minutes of our session tape it probably would be [inaudible] gist of the whole thing because [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I had a thought and a question.

[ph]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well I feel like sometimes, maybe a bit, [inaudible] you set me up a little or set this up a little in a particular way where you will describe something that clearly matters a lot in a fairly abstract and somewhat spare [ph] way where it's then difficult for me to know what it refers to. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">[00:45:31.16] And it's complicated because either I ask, which then sort of interrupts your association but also demonstrates interest, which I don't mind, but it changes the tenor [ph] a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Mm-hm. You like to avoid it if you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, not because I'm not interested but because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Can you give me an example?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Sure. A few minutes ago when you referred to taking care of the relationship. There was no way I could've gotten from what you said to what you meant. There are half a dozen things like that in this hour. And there often are at other times. And the set up piece, I think, goes beyond just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">am I going to ask or wait and see if I can understand it or whatever. The other piece is it leaves me kind of in the dark in some ways about what you're talking about, and I think it probably also makes you feel a bit neglected because then if I haven't asked, I'm not quite sure what you're talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">about and you have to explain it to me because I'm kind of in the dark and don't know what's going on, and then where the hell am I because I don't know what you're talking about and it's really important. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: [inaudible] got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I'm not telling you anything wrong, I'm just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: You are.

I'm saying I am bringing it up not to tell you to do it different, but because I think it relates to things that we're talking about. Either you're creating a situation which makes you feel more neglected, which is [inaudible] because you're telling me how much you hate feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">that way here, or you're giving over to me some of that feeling of being in the dark and not being sure [inaudible] not being sure where you're coming from or quite what's going on with you, or I need to ask and pursue because that's something that you feel a lot towards me, and it's kind of a way of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">showing me what that feels like. Does that make sense? [00:48:18.27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: It's sort of a backwards way of showing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: People do that all the time.
