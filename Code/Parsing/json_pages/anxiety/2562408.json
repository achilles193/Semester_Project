And the weekend can be hard.  And figuring out what to do can be hard. And you can feel anxious or overwhelmed or angst-y. I don\u2019t know that that happens every weekend, but I think it happens fairly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">often. I mean, we\u2019ve haven\u2019t talked about it detail in a while. But, yeah, my point is it seems maybe the idea that you\u2019re just focusing on the negative is actually focusing away from what you anticipate it will be like.
