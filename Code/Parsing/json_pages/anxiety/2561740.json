You have a huge pin in your wrist there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I do, you\u2019re correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Just a little humor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: So yesterday when I left here, I had let Eva know what was going on, and then right then, one of my wacky Assyrian friends texted me to say he was going to Waterboro, Quebec for something, and that I should take a ride with him, so I was like \u201cYou know what? Fuck it.\u201d It was a nice sunny day, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">you know. So I did that. That took pretty much all day. He\u2019s a nut job. But it was good to be with a friend, and I never go to Quebec for anything, really, so it was nice. And then of course, Eva didn\u2019t even I sent her this thing, just like I said, \u201cIf you want, I can drop it off, I\u2019m really sorry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">I know I\u2019m new here and I don\u2019t want you to think blah blah blah\u2026\u201d. She wrote back something that said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s totally fine\u201d. Yeah, so that\u2019s nice. It doesn\u2019t completely solve my issue but at least it\u2019s something. [pause 00:01:24 to 00:01:42] Yeah, so I don\u2019t know, I guess I talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">to my mom again, and I guess we can talk to my uncle, and that really puts me into knots; I don\u2019t want to have to do that, but I just can\u2019t figure out another way to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: It sounds like that way feels better to you than working at a coffee shop, or something -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: That is another way to do it, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I mean, that is another way, but it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s the issue. That\u2019s not a way to start a business, really. A coffee shop can\u2019t give me a certain wad of cash to, let\u2019s say, do some kind of marketing thing, you know what I mean? That\u2019s a way to \u2013 like the tutoring \u2013 it\u2019s a way to start making <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">a little bit of money. I\u2019m going to do that anyway, whether my uncle helps us or not, that has to happen anyway, so to me they\u2019re kind of different. Something needs to happen to make a weekly \u2013 money trickling in. But something bigger needs to happen for, what we were talking \u2013 paying some debts off. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">My mom needs a washing machine \u2013 our washing machine\u2019s been broken, my mom hangs the laundry, it\u2019s ridiculous. If we were able to just pay off that one credit card, we could go and just get her a fucking dryer and be done with it or whatever. These are just such silly things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">[pause 00:03:09 to 00:03:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">I think one thing I\u2019m realizing though, well, I\u2019ve always known, but now it\u2019s really hitting home, is that times like this you have to think of your relationship to money. It is a day-to-day thing and it\u2019s stressful, but you also have to, I think, take a break and think about what\u2019s you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: In other words, I constantly have a tummy ache, back here is literally now just a slab of granite. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on back here. My lower back \u2013 I\u2019m just jacked up, not in a good way. So are others not to compare, but what is that? What is it that I can\u2019t even disconnect a bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">from that? I can intellectually \u2013 things are good, things are okay, I can go to Quebec, I\u2019m alright, but I think there is something going on on a deeper level that\u2019s really driving me crazy about this money thing. It\u2019s probably that \u2013 money\u2019s always been kind of looming for my family. My mom has been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">so, you know what I mean, about \u2013 not as bad as her sisters, but still, status, and just kind of conforming with her group of the Assyrian friends that she has or whatever. And then, not bringing me up with real guidance about money. The only guidance was what, \u201cPay for things in cash.\u201d There were just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">these immigrant things, and that\u2019s not the way the world was working any more. \u201cDon\u2019t have credit cards. Don\u2019t get into debt.\u201d That\u2019s all great, but pay for college, how to live when you don\u2019t live at home. So I think it\u2019s all this stuff that <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561740\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a long history with money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: And a very kind of bumpy, choppy, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: On occasion you\u2019ve alluded to the feeling that money was killing your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think \u2013 remember, I was saying, that\u2019s why I think the hypochondria is back, I feel like \u201cOh my God, is this what he felt like?\u201d and then he just keeled over and died. I think that\u2019s triggered this weird thing in me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Do you remember them fighting about it, or would he explicitly -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Not them fighting, I just remember my dad, especially toward the end, there was something going on with that business, like, he didn\u2019t want to do it. I remember one or two very tense things with him. Not with my mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: With your uncle, the conversation? Or?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Not like towards each other, just him there was something going on. I don\u2019t remember really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Maybe you didn\u2019t know, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wasn\u2019t savvy enough, I think, to whatever the business things \u2013 I mean I know it was a big deal to go from working in a factory and we were going to own not just the store but that whole property. I just don\u2019t know because I feel like my uncle, the guy knows his shit. I mean, he wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">who he is now, but I trust him with my life. So when it comes to money stuff, the guy has nothing but our best interests, and I don\u2019t remember him saying it\u2019s not a good idea \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the fuck it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Were they going to buy it together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: No. Just your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Just my dad. My uncle was kind of like, really involved, his expertise and helping, negotiating and all that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: And buy the whole building. That\u2019s expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: It was, but you know, we\u2019re talking 1990 or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s all relative, but we could do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: They had the money, in other words, for -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I mean, we had our house, and maybe my uncle was help \u2013 just like we had helped him. There were times when my parents would write him $25000 checks, and he would just turn around and pay it back as soon as he finished his condo. He was basically flipping before flipping was a thing. He\u2019d be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">like, in those areas that are really nice now, those were like, crack-infested places; he was making them into nice condos. He would always need money at the last minute to just finish everything. My parents would help him, and he would turn around and pay them after he sold it. So maybe there was something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">like that, he helped them \u2013 I don\u2019t remember, but I know that it was this Not only that, but I think that we had maybe even not that we had bought it, but that we were like \u2013 I think things were even signed or something. Something was really close, I think, when my dad died. Who knows whether it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F3\">was \u2013 it could have been that my dad was just depressed. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a money thing. Maybe he was always like that, who knows? I just don\u2019t know. And also when you\u2019re a kid, you may exaggerate like, \u201cHe can\u2019t be upset sometimes,\u201d you know what I mean? But I take that, now that he\u2019s dead, I take that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F4\">and what was going on \u2013 you attach meanings to things. I was frustrated. He hurt his arm in the factory, and then he\u2019s fucking depressed. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561740\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: What did you notice when you say \u201che\u2019s fucking depressed\u201d? What would you see in him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m just saying, in retrospect\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: But what \u2013 when you\u2019re at that age, what are you even picking up in him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: He would nap a lot. On the weekends he would nap \u2013 granted, the guy worked in the factory, he\u2019s tired. I mean, George naps a lot. I don\u2019t think George\u2019s depressed, you know. But\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s actually the same as my mom. Maybe we all have this melancholy thing. We\u2019re different \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">I\u2019m more like my dad where I laugh and I make light of things, but there\u2019s something melancholy. Maybe that\u2019s what it was. Depression is a big word. Because if he was depressed, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, regardless of whether you\u2019d call it that or not, I\u2019m just curious -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: There\u2019s definitely a melancholy -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What was he like, you know? What did you pick up on? What stressed him out, how did he express being stressed, that kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Honestly I think the only thing that really stressed him out was my mom\u2019s family. I don\u2019t remember my dad complaining about work, or\u2026 Remember, I was even telling you, we\u2019d go pick him up at one in the morning, and we\u2019d go to IHOP? Why would a depressed guy do that all the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d go pick him up at one in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t think I went alone, I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: But still, you were a teenager then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Well, not when I was going to go to school the next day. I\u2019m just saying, a Friday night. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s all a blur. A lot of the times \u2013 maybe it was the summer. I have no idea. Matter of fact, it had to be. I don\u2019t remember on snowy nights, doing that, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">my grandma, my grandpa, me and my mom. We\u2019d pick him up, we\u2019d go straight to IHOP. That\u2019s \u2013 depressed people can\u2019t do that more than a couple \u2013 he\u2019d be like \u201cLook, I\u2019m tired, I want to go home\u201d. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Regardless of whether we call it depression, it\u2019s not important, it\u2019s just trying to know him, and what was going on in his inner life, that you were picking up on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I have no idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I think you know more than you think you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: So much you say \u201cI don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know, anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. It does matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I think really it was just a family thing. Those years when my mom\u2019s side was just douchey. I know that stressed him out for a fact. I know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: How would you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Because they would fight. There would be a lot of fighting. Money, I think sometimes. Remember in North Carolina, I was saying, they fought? They joked that they were going to get divorced \u2013 or my mom joked that they were going to get \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that was about though. I don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">they were fighting about. Some of it, maybe, was just marital stuff. You know what I mean? Who knows? Then there was that really bad one, I was telling you, remember, in the summer one night, I was getting dropped off, my uncle was dropping \u2013 not Derek \u2013 but my mom\u2019s brother-in-law was dropping me off. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200792\">And the minute we opened the door, we could hear yelling. It was late at night, I don\u2019t know what that was about either. I just don\u2019t know. I can surmise that that was when we had just moved back. They were staying at my grandparents\u2019 house. That could not have been easy on my dad. Or on my mom. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200793\">probably that pulled at them. And my dad was the type where he wouldn\u2019t show any anger, but when he did, it was not pretty.

[laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Which I think is so similar to how you\u2019ve described your experience, since 19, for a long time. Lost, trying to find your own space, your own mind again. [pause from 00:32:02 to 00:32:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: Or even trying to find your way into here, both public and private. Trying to find your own self. And maybe in this dream, how you\u2019re feeling, feeling like you\u2019ve lost it, a little bit, where is it? Where did it go? Now you\u2019ve started at least, in the sessions CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve had a number <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201251\">of dreams. I just remembered another dream I\u2019ve had, that of course I can\u2019t completely remember, there have been so many vivid ones lately, but something about like, a flight, a flight, maybe Assyria, something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: A flight to go there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: Go there, come from there, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember. But I think clearly there\u2019s a lot of dreams about \u2013 I think that\u2019s why a lot of them are anxiety dreams. It\u2019s about both the thing I\u2019m trying to get to, and about where I\u2019m coming from. Deep stuff probably getting stirred up. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561740\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Let me put it slightly more positively than just being anxiety dreams. So many of them sound like, lately, like they\u2019re dreams of transformation. Which has anxiety in it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: sometimes they emphasize not knowing, feeling lost, what\u2019s next, where am I, what\u2019s going to happen around the corner?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s true. I guess [unintelligible] because I very rarely \u2013 it\u2019s rare that I would wake up feeling panic, and I really hate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: Sure. And transformation is terrifying for people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true, it\u2019s true. That\u2019s why I was saying, a lot of these dreams aren\u2019t really scary, they\u2019re not scary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking of your dreams, about the worms, are you becoming [ph? Brian]? And you said \u201cyeah\u201d. And then you woke up in a panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s both like, matter of fact \u2013 [crosstalk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that one\u2019s really symbolic. [crosstalk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Right. Because in a way, still, who is that person, will he become, will he fail?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">CLIENT: I mean, yeah, that\u2019s one thing I try to remind myself now, when I feel like I can\u2019t breathe, or I\u2019m kind of whatever, feel physically wacky, I try to think of \u2013 it\u2019s almost like an exorcism in a way. I think something is \u2013 because really the future is good. I think things will be alright. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201411\">there\u2019s something I think, that\u2019s what all these years have been. A process of trying to exorcise this \u2013 not necessarily a demon, but like, a past? Things that have been obstacles and just messed \u2013 not letting me be my own \u2013 have my own mind or have my own sense of self. So in that way, I try \u2013 maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201412\">that\u2019s why I\u2019m not having full-blown panic or anxiety, and why I\u2019m still completely doing things very well. It\u2019s like a good transformation kind of thing, but maybe it\u2019s just terrifying, or it\u2019s kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">THERAPIST: Transformations are terrifying for people. You know, we\u2019ve talked about \u2013 it\u2019s so easy to be, like, do it the same. You know the same. You know how to be only hypochondriacal or paranoid. That\u2019s familiar, it\u2019s comforting, it\u2019s how your whole family responds, it\u2019s predictable. To not do that? <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201431\">To be breaking out, and finding, forging a new path? You don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like, or where that leads you. It\u2019s so uncomfortable, in a way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah. Last night when I got home from the thing I said hi to my mom, we sat there a little bit, she said, \u201cSo is everything okay\u201d blah blah blah. We talked about talking to my uncle, this or that, she was like \u201cI\u2019m going to take\u201c This poor woman, she has like seven grand or something in something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201451\">\u2013 IRA, I don\u2019t know what it is \u2013 she\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m going to take $1000 or $2000 out of that, I\u2019ll give that to you, that will at least get you whatever.\u201d But, this was a trip for me, is that I found myself, I mean I was feeling the way I feel now, but I found myself going \u201cYou know, everything is going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201452\">to be okay\u201d. Like out loud. I was like \u201cEverything is going to be fine.\u201d I\u2019m doing everything right. I\u2019ve talked to enough people, they\u2019re not just random friends or whatever, people that know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about, who I trust. And besides that, I just trust myself. I\u2019ve done my research.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20144-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20144-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561740\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve gotten to know yourself more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m not just sitting on my ass, I\u2019m still looking for a job, I\u2019m not looking for specific jobs, I\u2019m trying to be open-minded. Just a job. An office job. Whatever. But nothing comes with no \u2013 not just hard work, but especially a business \u2013 you\u2019ve got to have some cash \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201491\">that, it\u2019s really not rocket science, there just needs to be a little bit of money. It\u2019s not really a lot. It\u2019s not a lot. So then she was saying, \u201cSo then, can you do it with, like, $5000?\u201d But that\u2019s the problem. I probably could. But that\u2019s not the issue. Then that money\u2019s going to be gone, and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201492\">not like I\u2019m going to have, suddenly, thirty clients. And then we\u2019re going to be back to square one. You\u2019re still not going to have a dryer machine. So I was like, \u201cWe need a bigger solution, so we don\u2019t keep having to have these day-to-day worries.\u201d Then it becomes, yeah, it\u2019s still a worry, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201493\">now we have debt that\u2019s going to be added, but now it\u2019s ours, it\u2019s not feeling weird about your brother helping you, or having these ridiculous little debts, here and there. But what I\u2019m trying to say, is, though, that was very new. To end the conversation like that. Not only that, it was new for me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201494\">not her. She\u2019s been like that. My mom\u2019s been pretty, \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay\u201d. Yeah, she\u2019s a mom. I think she sees that I\u2019m just \u2013 and she\u2019s worrying, she\u2019s like \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay, don\u2019t worry about it, don\u2019t think too much\u201d, blah blah blah. But it was the first time for me, to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201495\">like \u201cEverything will be -\u201d because normally I just get annoyed. Even when she\u2019s telling me everything will be fine. It\u2019s just that old dynamic. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, everything\u2019s not -\u201d you know, I just feel\u2026 but last night I was like \u201cOh\u2026everything will be fine, you know\u201d. I think it was almost like, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201496\">was just like \u201cI\u2019m just going to start saying that\u201d. [laughter] Just like, fake it til you make it. Or not fake it, but just, you know, I just decided to say it.  [pause to 00:40:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Is there a network of life coaches online? Like an online professional society, or anything like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s a couple of things on LinkedIn, you know those groups they have on LinkedIn? Yeah. Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: I just \u2013 that\u2019s the part that I think is going to be hardest for you. So many people come out of this from graduate schools; they\u2019re getting into this kind of field or program, where they have colleagues for support, for mentorship, as supervisors. That\u2019s a lot of where \u2013 most people in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">field at least get referrals from people who supervise them, or were colleagues in school, or something like that. That\u2019s actually where it starts, so much more than advertising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: Any kind of advertising. I agree. I agree. I\u2019ve been thinking about that. I think I\u2019m holding back. It\u2019s like what I was saying yesterday, I want to feel a little bit better or something, I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m going to reach out, maybe to some local life coaches, like \u201chey guys, what\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201511\">on, do you have time for lunch, I\u2019d love to take you out to lunch and talk\u201d. You know, and then if somebody \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20150-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20150-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561740\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">THERAPIST: Start networking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">CLIENT: Start networking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">THERAPIST: Or even, there isn\u2019t an organization, I don\u2019t know anything about life-coaching from this perspective, there isn\u2019t a Connecticut association or anything like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">CLIENT: There\u2019s got to be. I haven\u2019t found \u2013 there\u2019s got to be, like, a branch, or something. Yeah. I\u2019m sure there is. I\u2019m sure there is. But I\u2019m saying, I know people who know life coaches. That\u2019s also another good way. A mutual friend. Because I could definitely use a mentor. I could definitely use <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201591\">someone who\u2019s been doing this, who\u2019s willing to, kind of \u2013 not take me under their wing, hopefully take me under their wing, but just kind of a sounding board, and, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Networking is one avenue of that, and a professional association is another one. They may have something that even has a monthly talk on some subject, where people gather and have coffee or something. People pay for supervision, in my field, at least. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">CLIENT: No, yeah. Coaches do too, yeah. Coaches sometimes pay for their own mentor coaches. But see, then again, cashish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Of course you need money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">CLIENT: But, in the meantime, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t just network. Because you never know. Someone could be really cool, and you just click, and they\u2019re doing fine, they don\u2019t necessarily need the money, they enjoy just kind of\u2026 you know. Because also, these things go both ways. They might refer <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201611\">people to you, but you might refer people to them, or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">THERAPIST: Sure, of course, there\u2019s something in it for them, too, if it\u2019s a, you know, peer-level colleague instead of someone more senior. But even, whoever you connect with, you could start saying, \u201cIs there an association? What do I need to know about how people network?\u201d that kind of thing. Just <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201631\">pick their brain like that. Because you\u2019re going to feel as if you\u2019re so isolated, right now, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not enough to, like, read books, and watch videos. Yeah, yeah, of course. You need to interact with people. That\u2019s why, you know, I\u2019ll probably start going to their \u2013 the building has these very informal \u2013 therapists just get together. Again, I just feel a little \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be in <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201651\">there feeling like I can\u2019t breathe or something. I just want to be a little more\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">THERAPIST: So take an Ativan and go. I think you\u2019ll feel better if you just go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Get into it.

You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s been \u2013 that, not so much, but I\u2019ve been meaning to find some people, and e-mail them. Because I know myself. I could be \u2013 I mean. Yeah yeah yeah. Some of it\u2019s just being shy, and feeling -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: I think it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re doing fine right now.
