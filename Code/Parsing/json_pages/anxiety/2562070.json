It was pretty good. They have these little 15to 20-minute on-stage shows with a couple of people. We went to two of those because they really liked the first one and they loved [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:44). At the second <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">one they had all these little kids. It was the Three Little Pigs. They had all these little kids go up and be characters.  There was this one little girl who is probably about six, maybe five. She was really excited to go up and then once she was on stage she just started to weep. I think she was scared. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">I couldn\u2019t really tell what was going on. Only when she got up there did she realize how many people were in the audience or something. She was weeping but not in a way that little kids usually cry. She was trying to hide it and trying not to cry and trying not to have everybody see that she was crying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">in this way. I almost started crying. (laughs) It was sort of heart-breaking. (pause)  It took the people who were running it a couple of minutes to realize what was going on and say \u201cdo you want to go sit down?\u201d and get somebody else up. It was really sad. (pause) Other than that it was a good day. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D4\">I like taking the kids to public museums and public places because they\u2019re really well behaved in public. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: [How\u2019s that going for you?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: (laughs) I feel really good about it.  All of the tantrums and melt-downs and everything happen at home. I fell asleep in the car on the way home. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking about this in relation to the last couple of days in that it seems both with the girl on stage and with the kids who watched, (client sniffling) there\u2019s a sense that you don\u2019t get upset in front of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. Although for the kids I watch, I don\u2019t think that they feel an external pressure to do that. I think it\u2019s just easier for them. The things that set them off more often come up when we\u2019re at home.  It\u2019s not like they are really, really careful to behave well. It\u2019s just that they are usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">in a pretty good mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I see. Because they\u2019re at the Children\u2019s Museum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. They\u2019re good a sharing with each other and they\u2019re good at the stuff that they\u2019re asked to do at the museum, in public. And the stuff that they\u2019re not good at, like eating food and taking naps when it\u2019s time to take naps and not all talking at once, is stuff that comes up at home. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">this girl struck me as very different from the way that these kids that I babysit seem to be because she seemed to have this very clear sense that it wasn\u2019t okay to be upset in public. It wasn\u2019t okay to cry or to be scared.  She was trying really hard to hide that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s not that they would be like that, it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t get upset in that same way. They didn\u2019t mind so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Selena (sp?) was just like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go up.\u201d (laughs) Sorry, I feel like I sort of derailed you there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s all right. What I was going to say was that you\u2019ve recently been feeling very sad, but I think it also has some feeling of wanting to keep it in and not show it to me.  I know that\u2019s not the only feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562070\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess I sort of associate that kind of wanting not to show being sad with adulthood or with being older. I don\u2019t remember ever not feeling like it was more important not to show anybody that I was sad than it was to feel better. (pause) I don\u2019t know how that happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I wonder, too, if you were upset that I was late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: No. (laughs) You\u2019re late a lot. (laughs) I\u2019m over it. It\u2019s okay. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I am late a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: That really, really doesn\u2019t bother me. (pause) I guess taking care of these kids has been so good for me in so many ways. A lot of the things that I remember about being a small child are really different (laughs) from the way that they are.  That\u2019s sort of reassuring for me in terms of thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">about having my own kids, but it\u2019s also \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to sort of [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:23). (pause) Part of it, also, is that I don\u2019t have those clear memories that start at three or four. I don\u2019t remember being three, apparently, at all. I can remember a couple of things. Yeah. (pause)  One <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">of the first things, one of my really early memories \u2013 I think I was like five \u2013 was hiding in my room crying and somebody came and asked me why I was crying and I just said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (pause) It\u2019s as though I feel like I remember that because I don\u2019t think I stopped crying after that. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">think that whoever it was that came and saw me made it better. (long pause)  James has been very careful because, understandably, he doesn\u2019t really want to come down with neuro-virus, so I got home from work yesterday and I sort of went to give him a hug and he backed up. I had changed my clothes and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200294\">then I went to give him a hug and he sort of backed up and he was like, \u201cCan you wash your hands?\u201d That is fine, but it also really hurt my feelings. I don\u2019t want him to try not to get sick, but . . .  (long pause) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve felt particularly strongly in the last few days that I wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200295\">to not show you that I\u2019m sad or how sad I am. I guess I more felt like . . . I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t know what to do with it. (pause) I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s sort of overwhelming and it\u2019s not flooding me, it\u2019s just sort of [an ache] (ph?) a lot. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">I\u2019ve been thinking about this recently in the context of how open I want to be about mental health issues and sort of deciding that I want to be pretty open about it, both because that\u2019s easier for me in terms of logistical stuff and if I\u2019m not telling everybody everything, I can\u2019t keep track of what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">I\u2019ve told people. (laughs)  I do think it\u2019s something I can do to help; but I also feel like, in some way, it sort of raises the pressure for me to be sort of rational and cheerful and not to tick off the things that people might be afraid of when they find out that I have serious mental issues. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">like people are afraid or will get anxious that I\u2019ll be really clingy and needy or that I will be unreliable or all these sort of other things that we associate with people with mental illness.  If I\u2019m going to talk about it then I have to function really well, (laughs) which is really the opposite <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">of the point. (laughs) (long pause)  I\u2019m nervous about telling Kim and Frank about it, and I told them maybe three months into working with them. I just started letting that be the case \u2013 basically when it seemed to me that they were confident that I was doing a good job. But now I feel like I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B4\">want to bring my depression to work. It\u2019s pretty easy not to. It\u2019s very, very easy not to, actually. I just sort of put it away most of the time.  (pause) It feels like I\u2019m not actually doing what I had hoped to be doing there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562070\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Right. The initial thought was that you wanted to be okay for you to have mental illness. I guess, in this case, okay with the two of them; and also to educate them a little bit.  I don\u2019t know if this is true with the two of them in particular, but in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Way less for them, but in general. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just sort of snotty thinking of that in those terms. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s not quite right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Normalize it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There you go. That\u2019s better. I think we\u2019re talking about the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Maybe that gets it a little more what matters about the things you\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 like the girl at the show? It\u2019s not that you sort of want to be upset on stage in front of people, but that you identified with how hard she was working and how ashamed or scared or something she felt for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">other people to see that. Maybe a little with James, too. He was talking about germs.  Maybe it can feel a little like that about the depression, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Sort of like him wanting to insulate himself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Wanting you to clean yourself up a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess I feel like that may or may not apply for him. I\u2019m not intending to say that\u2019s exactly how he\u2019s being or what he wants, but I know it feels that way to you and maybe he is being that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s much less that he\u2019s being that way. It\u2019s much more that it sort of feels like that. (long pause)  There was a really great piece in one of the NPR blogs last night. I don\u2019t remember the author\u2019s name. She was talking about the reporting on Chris Christy and how every time somebody does <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">a funny angle, he talks about how he\u2019s fat. She talks about what that feels like as a fat woman for whom that really hurts. The way she put it, a lot of people have sort of a red handle that\u2019s really deep inside that when you pull on it, it just really hurts. That could be the relationship with your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">parents or whatever, but for some people, like for me, that\u2019s on the outside.  Everybody can see that I\u2019m fat. It was really beautiful, actually. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">It feels like I\u2019m only ever really okay with talking about [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:23) depression and things to do with depression that have already happened. It\u2019s pretty easy for me to talk about my childhood and teenage years at those points, and sort of tell what that means and think about that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">It\u2019s easier for me to talk about what it was like to be hospitalized with people; but when it\u2019s happening, I just don\u2019t want anybody to know.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">I feel like stoicism is really overrated. (laughs) There are a couple of novels from the turn of the last century that were very important to me, either as a child or as a young adult. One of the common themes is never complaining about suffering, not even not complaining about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562070\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Is that the 20th century?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Never admitting to it. Maybe 1850\u2019s, sort of late Victorian.  Thinking about the matriarch of the family having this chronic illness and she\u2019s unclear what it is. It wipes her out a lot of the time and it\u2019s like she never says anything about it until she faints and has to be taken to bed; <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">and that\u2019s seen as this remarkable heroism. Maybe. (laughs) Maybe in a time and place where there wasn\u2019t anything they could do about it. (pause) I also feel like the times in my life where I most closely attained that ideal, it\u2019s turned out really badly. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Of course there was something they could do about it. They may not have been able to treat it medically, but a lot of times people with chronic illnesses want to talk about them or have people do things for them related to it. \u201cWe should stop doing this before I faint.\u201d (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: I know, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: We should stop for today.
