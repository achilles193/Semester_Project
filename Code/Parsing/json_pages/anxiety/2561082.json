Thank you very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: How are you today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Good, thank you. [New\/You?] opening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to. [pause] So I\u2019m supposed to defend my dissertation in three weeks, which means I have to send to my committee in two weeks. It\u2019s not really written yet, so that\u2019s a little bit stressful. I\u2019m going to have a lot more to say about that than \u201cthat\u2019s a little bit stressful,\u201d or a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">stressful. So that\u2019s going on. [long pause] Yeah. So on Monday during our couples counseling session Dr. Jannis suggested\u2026 he suggested that Tanya has two voices going on inside of her, one that\u2019s like telling the other, \u201cYou have to hold it together, you have to do this,\u201d or whatever, comply with whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">and the other that doesn\u2019t want to, and presumably feels sad. This seemed to really resonate with her as a description. That was fine, it\u2019s not particularly striking. He then suggested that for her I get associated with the other voice. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And then he said that he felt like one of the things that we might continue to work on in the couples therapy is separating the identity, because I\u2019m really not that voice. Although sometimes we say the same thing, but that\u2019s just a feature of, I don\u2019t know, something. Anyway, so I thought this was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">a very striking description really. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve done any justice in explaining it, but I\u2019m sort of assuming that it\u2019s not conceptually that far outside of what you\u2019re familiar with or something, so you\u2019re getting pieces that I may not be conveying properly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. [3:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I think I find this striking because it rationalizes a lot of observations very well, in the sense that\u2026 [pause] \u2026in a sense that the worse Tanya gets, the more she seems to think she has to be okay in front of me all the time. Which I think is just really not helpful, either for our relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">or for her personally. But that serves as a very simple explanation of that feature, because if I\u2019m associated with this voice telling her she has to hold it together, then obviously she has to hold it together finally. It also makes a lot of sense in the context of her past relationships, with her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">first boyfriend, with her father, both of whom were\u2014you know, we\u2019ve talked about me being angry sometimes, but I don\u2019t really plot on the scale of their anger management issues. [5:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">[long pause] But I guess I don\u2019t have\u2014I\u2019ve felt before that there was a sense in which she was not seeing me as me, but as one of them in some sense. But if all of the people in that specific role map onto this person who is probably heavily associated with her father, because presumably it comes direct <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">but has existed since she was young when that trouble was going on, then that makes a lot more sense also in some ways. Not that I\u2026 It makes more sense. So\u2026 [pause] So there was a sense in which it was really good, a clear picture and perhaps a useful model for moving forward. There\u2019s a sense in which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">it\u2019s sad, because I almost don\u2019t exist. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">We\u2019ve talked before that I felt like I couldn\u2019t really help, I could only hurt her. And while that\u2019s not really true, the feeling was true, and the feeling was real, and I think it\u2019s related to this feature in some way. Anything I say that\u2019s negative she\u2019ll take and use against herself, but anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">I say that\u2019s positive will just kind of fall off. So\u2026 [pause] I think I\u2019ve stumbled through everything that I had wanted to say on that, so I\u2019m curious what you think about that. [7:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561082\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Well, I like the\u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an analogy or metaphor, I\u2019m not quite sure, but it seems like it fits very well, and I\u2019m not at all surprised that Tanya sort of feels that you\u2019re, you know, one particular voice, [it\u2019s not?]\u2014in some ways she both wants to rebel against it but feels she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">needs it. And so I can see like that makes sense. I\u2019m kind of curious about your\u2014sort of the scary part of feeling like you don\u2019t exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I mean, I think I said sad, so I guess scary is\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh sorry. I misheard, that was my\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. I wasn\u2019t sure if you were taking that from what I was saying\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: No. No, no, no, I guess I misheard. I\u2019m not sure why I heard it that way. Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes. Sad is how I feel about it, because I feel like I\u2019m not\u2014I feel like I don\u2019t really exist for her in some sense. And so then it\u2019s like I don\u2019t matter, or particular features of me are not\u2026 [long pause] Maybe another way of describing it is like I feel like on that description my role is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">to continue being who I am and wait for her to work out the difference between me and this other voice. [pause] I don\u2019t like waiting a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Hm. [10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I guess I would describe myself as patient. And I\u2019ve sort of been struggling with that idea for a little while.

I think I\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re patient if it\u2019s not challenged? If your patience isn\u2019t challenged?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I can sit and do tedious things for a really long time, which I think is a form of patience. But it\u2019s an active patience, not a passive one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not waiting for somebody else\u2014I mean, you\u2019re not\u2014it\u2019s within your control even if it\u2019s [overtalk].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s probably right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not quite clear why you feel you need to wait.

What\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: I was starting to respond, then I wasn\u2019t really sure what the question was, so I\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, no. No, no, no, tell me\u2014yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: But I lost\u2014I\u2019m afraid I lost track of this question once I\u2014 I don\u2019t know that I have a\u2026 What else do I do in my\u2014 Obviously I can leave. Or I can wait for her to come to see me as someone else, the person I actually am. But like in between those two lines what\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, it assumes that, you know, what Dr. Jannis was saying, you know, if true, that\u2019s not the totality of her experience of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Sure. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not like she can\u2019t see you at all outside of this experience. [11:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. [very long pause, to 3 \u00bd minutes to 15:15] Yeah, that\u2019s probably right. [long pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What were you thinking about? [15:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I just\u2014the\u2014trying to, um\u2026 trying to articulate or figure out what exactly I mean there by\u2014yeah, absolutely her experience of me extends beyond her association with me with this voice. But\u2026 [pause] Yeah, and one sort of thing to do is to continue to do the things that are not associated with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">that voice, because that is the path forward for us in some sense. You know, being nice to her. [pause] I guess I just have this feeling that there\u2019s a lack of robustness to that relationship. It\u2019s fairly tightly delimited at that point. I don\u2019t know. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561082\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">Yeah, as if the extent to which she can see me in actuality, or some approximation thereof, it depends on how well she is at the time. So the worse she is the less I exist to her. Or the more I look like this other voice. But I\u2019m\u2014you know, I guess\u2026 [pause] I guess at some point that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re never <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">fully known by another person, that\u2019s just\u2026 you can only be yourself, so you can\u2019t really know someone else a hundred percent or else you would be both of you or something. So that\u2019s fine at some point. But then at that some point\u2026 I don\u2019t know where okay is in between the two ends. [19:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, [it does sound normalized?]. I mean, couples project onto each other all the time. [pause] I mean, how we experience other people is a composite with\u2014you know, about who they really are and how we see them based on our own experience and our perception and our needs and our own fears. [long pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I hear you, and yes, that makes sense. And I don\u2019t really have any objection to that, that\u2019s fine. But\u2026 [pause] I find something unsettling about this that I don\u2019t seem to be able to articulate usefully. So\u2026 [pause] Maybe I\u2019m upset because the description says something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">the nature of where our relationship is that I don\u2019t like. And maybe I\u2019m mixing that up with some concern about the future here. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I think one of Tanya\u2019s concerns is meeting my needs in some larger sense, but\u2026 Which should be a good thing. But because she, (a) puts a lot of pressure on herself to do it, and (b) essentially makes up what those are, she makes them up and then fails at them, and so they were never needs of mine in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">the first place, while needs that I actually have are just being ignored entirely. So I think this is maybe what I\u2019m trying to get at in the \u201cI don\u2019t exist.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s not just, you know, this piece, it\u2019s part of a larger fabric of feeling not seen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. That she\u2019s relating to an idea of you and not you. [23:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. But again, I acknowledge that that\u2019s all we ever do in some sense, like with other people. We relate with our idea of the other person, which is hopefully based on them actually, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I absolutely agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Okay. I wanted you to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: No, I absolutely agree. But there are sort of degrees of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: And one person\u2014when the other person feels recognized you can assume that there\u2019s enough relating to that person that the other piece is not the predominant piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And maybe a slightly different way of saying this is it speaks to your fear that Tanya\u2019s sort of in her own world dealing with her own difficulties and doesn\u2019t have enough space for you in the relationship. [24:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s exactly right.

So yeah, when you do speak I hear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: On the other hand\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: So go for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s not going to work very well, because I have no idea what to say at all here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: You know, you sort of expressed a general curiosity. But I think I assume that you have some specific curiosities, and if I start talking I have no idea where I\u2019m going to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Maybe. [And everything else? 25:54] in terms of the specific curiosities, like yes and no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Because I\u2019m curious, but then I don\u2019t presume I know it\u2019s there. I\u2019m just very aware\u2014you know, but I\u2019ll work with people, I usually know about their relationships with their parents in some respect, their experience of it. I mean, I certainly know a lot of events that happened in your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: I feel like I know less about your experience of them, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: [chuckles] Yeah. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know much about who they are to you. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s really interesting. Like in some ways I don\u2019t know who they are to me now. Because I\u2019ve been away at school for a long time. [long pause] So I was thinking about you saying that you knew a lot about events but not a lot about experience, and I feel like there\u2019s something particular to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">how I talk about things that that reflects. I was just thinking about that a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t feel that way across the board with you at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Oh, okay. [28:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: No, no, no, not at all. I feel I very much know a lot about your experience. So not in general\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: \u2014in particular with your parents. Like I know a lot of the things that happened in your family to your family. So I was referring to that very specifically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Okay. Because I feel like often I\u2019ll come in and I will present a set of facts and that you\u2019ll ask questions about experience, and that\u2019s sort of how that\u2014those conversations go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. But I feel like I learn a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Okay. All right. Yeah\u2026 Yeah, I guess if you could prompt me I would find it very helpful too. I just am not really sure where to start talking, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Okay. That\u2019s such a good question, and I don\u2019t know how to start prompting. I feel anything I choose is somewhat arbitrary. For some reason I have a particular curiosity about your relationship with your mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Okay. So my father worked, my mother raised us, the five of us. And\u2026 I really love my mother, and she loves me. And\u2026 [pause] Yeah, I think in a general sense I want, and still want very much for her to be happy. So I think that I often like worked to make that happen, because it was clear that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">the things that I did might have an impact on that. [pause] Yeah, I guess I find this challenging. I\u2019m not quite sure why.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561082\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Why that in particular, making her happy, do you know? [30:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good question. Why did I say that in particular, or why did I feel it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, just what about\u2014not necessarily why you said that, but what about wanting to make her happy in particular do you think is important?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Um\u2026 Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I think it sort of\u2026 [pause] I think that was a sort of causal thing for a lot of my behavior as a child. So like I wanted to be good because I didn\u2019t want to upset my mother. In some sense, or something like that, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a complete description, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Do you feel like she was easily upset?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: [pause] Yeah, I don\u2019t know. Sort of in retrospect I think she\u2019s more easily upset than a lot of people I know. But I didn\u2019t really feel like that at the time, I felt like it was fairly clear what would upset her and what wouldn\u2019t, and like\u2026 that it wasn\u2019t\u2026 yeah, um\u2026 [pause] It was sort of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">she was upset when we did things that were bad or wrong and she was not upset when we did things that were good, and like that the easy thing didn\u2019t really\u2026 I guess when I hear you say that I sort of hear the question like was it easy to upset her sort of arbitrarily or without cause or something. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">not sure that\u2019s the question you\u2019re actually asking, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: No. I mean, you know, a lot of kids don\u2019t think about it, their parents seem fine, they don\u2019t really think about whether they\u2019re going to upset them or not. So that\u2019s why I was sort of asking did she\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Not, you know, did she not seem fine some of the time, which is why that became\u2014that went on your radar. [33:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: I see. No, no, not particularly. Like I just\u2026 [pause] Yeah, and maybe we\u2019re speaking to some feature of me that\u2019s been around for a long time and like I\u2026 Yeah, I don\u2019t know which order it goes in, right. Did I want to do the right thing, whatever that was exactly, to please my mother, or\u2026 Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">or did I want to do the right thing and then my mother was like the\u2014a signal for whether it was right or wrong in some sense, because\u2026 But I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Were there particular things that were right things and particular things that were wrong things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Uh, yeah, I don\u2019t have a\u2014I don\u2019t have a really\u2026 So there\u2019s the\u2014there\u2019s this time, my mother had made a cake for some function. And my older sister really wanted some cake, and so she said, you know, \u201cWe should have some cake. We\u2019ll just take a little bit out of one side of it and then turn that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">side to the wall.\u201d [laughter] Because she\u2019ll never notice. I think I must have been five at this point, and so my sister\u2019s seven. So that\u2019s clearly not\u2014so. My mother yelled a little at that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: But that one actually stands out particularly distinctly because she was really upset. And in that context I think she was taking the cake to some event, and made it, and just made it in time, and let it sit on the counter to cool. And then along came [unclear 34:54]. So yeah, that seemed clearly <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">wrong in some sense, to make our scene at the time. Like, yeah, no, we shouldn\u2019t have done that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561082\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. [35:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: There\u2019s one example at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. [pause] That\u2019s a very particular thing, your thinking about pleasing your mom. [pause] Do you feel like your siblings had that same sort of desire?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: [pause] Well, I really didn\u2019t want to upset my mother. I don\u2019t know if that matches as the same thing. The other problem is that we\u2019re talking like a fifteen-year time span here, and so I\u2026 I can say something, and then you ask a question that I can answer about ten years later, but I\u2019m not sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">that\u2019s really the right\u2014you know, the\u2026 But\u2026 [pause] Yeah, I think my mother has a very clear sense of right and wrong. But yeah, my mother has a very clear sense of right and wrong that kind of just covers everything, and that is a particular feature of her worldview. I think there\u2019s a sense in which <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D52\">the ministry was a good thing because it gave a sort of justification for a set of things that were right and wrong and that was really helpful for her in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: So guess all of us had more challenging teenage years as a result of this than childhood years I think. So when you asked did my siblings want to please my mother, I think more easily to the teenage years where like\u2026 they still didn\u2019t want my mother to yell at them, but they wanted to do what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">they wanted to do. A lot more than I did. But even I, you know, sometimes wanted to do what I wanted to do. My mother had a very clear sense of right and wrong, but it was also not always exactly right. So like\u2026 Or not always exactly logically consistent maybe. But\u2026 [38:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like she wanted to understand when you did do something that was quote-unquote \u201cwrong\u201d? Like was she curious about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Interesting. That\u2019s a really interesting question. You know, I think\u2026 I think she would ask a question like, \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d but I don\u2019t know that she really wanted to understand. Yeah. [pause] But now I guess we\u2019re talking about a specific like\u2026 I am talking about a sort of specific <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">feature of my mother\u2019s anger in response to infractions. In a sort of more general sense I think my mother works very hard and is very interested in understanding who we are and what we do. So\u2026 [pause] I guess I wanted to say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: But not when she\u2019s angry now, not so much. But that doesn\u2019t last long, it\u2019s not like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Did you experience her sense of right and wrong as rigid at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: More so as I have grown up, yeah. And sort of as some of my views have changed I see hers as more rigid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. [40:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t think that experience really started until I was a teenager. I think sometimes in that time period I had the sense that my mother\u2019s justifications of right and wrong maybe didn\u2019t match. Or like the things she would say, \u201cThis is clearly not right,\u201d would not match onto like something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">that was actually wrong. So like I don\u2019t think she really liked any of the people my siblings and I dated, the first people that we dated, so my first girlfriend, or either of my sisters\u2019 first boyfriends. So I don\u2019t know whether that was particular to who those people were. I think there was some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E92\">that. I think there\u2019s some anxiety about that phase of our lives on her part. And so I think that sometimes the what is right and wrong got more arbitrary in that context. Like she was seeing it through not liking those things already, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561082\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. So what is right and wrong turned to be very sort of idiosyncratic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. A little more so than I felt like it had been as a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Do you know why she had a hard time with that period of your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t really know. I mean, I can speculate, but I don\u2019t really have a\u2014it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve talked a whole lot about it. I think there\u2019s a sense in which we were starting to make decisions on our own, and she felt some moral obligation for us to make the right decisions, but also couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">make the decisions for us anymore entirely. And so I think that tension was probably a large part of her being uncomfortable with our place in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. [42:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Do you actually find all this interesting? It\u2019s okay to say no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: What I was going to say is that\u2019s a question of skepticism. Do you actually find this interesting? [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: [laughs] Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Is it confusing why I asked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: [pause] No, not particularly. I think it\u2019s confusing for me for you to be interested, but maybe not, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: For me to be interested in this particular thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: Yes, but I think more as a general feature, yeah. Yeah, I think there\u2019s a sense in which I am very curious about why you do what you do. So I think that was reflected in that question. It wasn\u2019t just skepticism, although I did say it fairly skeptically, so sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: No need to apologize, I was sort of commenting on\u2026 [44:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I just feel like I\u2019m sitting here talking about things that happened in my childhood that\u2014or young adulthood, and I don\u2019t know that I\u2014I don\u2019t know that I attach a whole lot of weight to them. And so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s what I found interesting. I mean, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s only sort of traumatic events that shape who we are, it\u2019s the whole experience, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Just like you know Tanya\u2019s experience shapes a lot of the sort of difficulties, but not just difficulties, just who she is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: And so it\u2019s not me\u2014traumatic events sort of punctuate certain, you know, childhood\u2014sort of shapes a childhood experience, but that\u2019s not the only feature of it, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: Okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I\u2019m going on sort of very general I\u2014you know, yeah, just wanting to know more about your childhood experiences, and thinking about how that fits into who you are today, and how it maybe can better form how I think about what you\u2019re looking for and what you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: And so when I answer these questions about things that happened many years ago, to what extent are you filtering it through the experiences you know I\u2019ve had recently as you hear it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know, you know. [laughter] I don\u2019t have any specific\u2014I\u2019m listening, there\u2019s nothing\u2014it\u2019s not [egenic? 45:32] in that particular way I\u2019m listening, I\u2019m seeing what sort of strikes me or doesn\u2019t strike me and how I can make better meaning or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: So not necessarily in any particular way.
