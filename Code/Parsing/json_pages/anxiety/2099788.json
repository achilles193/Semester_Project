So we're about seven weeks into the year-ish (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">CLIENT: Well you just sent me a bill for fourteen hundred dollars. I just gave you over seven hundred dollars. Simple math suggest roughly seven hundred dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Let's see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">CLIENT: Do you got a pen (inaudible)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">THERAPIST: That's probably not the most effective way to figure it out because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">CLIENT: What? Using math?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">THERAPIST: Because that doesn't include the amount for the recordings and also because that's not covering all the sessions you've had so far. So probably a more reliable way to figure out...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20107\">CLIENT: Well you put a fifty dollar payment on there, on the bill, which I assumed was the recordings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20109\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) the other thing is the check that you gave me probably aren't for all the sessions. It's probably for some of the sessions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I mean, I can figure out exactly what is, is but (inaudible) sixteen visits times forty bucks is six hundred forty bucks. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010F\">CLIENT: Okay. It's not around seven hundred. It's six hundred and forty...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You're right! You're right. We get to the same thing. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20113\">CLIENT: Spit balling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20115\">THERAPIST: So. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to charge you a hundred bucks a week until you've chipped away...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20117\">CLIENT: That's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20119\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2011B\">CLIENT: That's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2011D\">THERAPIST: We'll do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2011F\">CLIENT: Who cares? Just to get you off my back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20121\">THERAPIST: Because I've really always been pretty aggressive with things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20123\">CLIENT: Does the clock start now? Was that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20125\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20127\">CLIENT: Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20129\">THERAPIST: Alright. Well that's what I'll do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2012B\">CLIENT: Because I always think... The first thing that comes to mind is like, well, if I was late, the clock wouldn't start when I got there. But when you're late the clock starts when you get here. You know? Just... I'm going to point out that inequity not that that's, you know, going to change anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2012B1\">but that's what I think about if you want to know what I think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2012F\">CLIENT: Okay. Some really... Are we done? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20131\">THERAPIST: I actually think the reason that that's what happens is, you know, when some people do that it's because they feel like unfairly done by or they want to stick it to me or something like that. For you, I think you mostly like want to make things my issue as much as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20133\">CLIENT: That's my modus operandi isn't it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20137\">CLIENT: Or as they say on Criminal Minds, MO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20139\">THERAPIST: It's a little like a magician saying like, you know, \"Look over here but don't look at what I'm doing over here.\" Misdirection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2013B\">CLIENT: Hmm. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2013F\">CLIENT: Are we done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20141\">THERAPIST: If you'd like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20143\">CLIENT: Okay. I'm having trouble...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20142-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20142-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099788\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20147\">CLIENT: ...visiting the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20149\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014B\">CLIENT: Because Jess (ph)... The only reason I called you passive aggressive is because it's on my mind. She's very passive aggressive with me when I go over there. Maybe she has been and I... Our whole marriage was very passive aggressive but it seems to have kicked up a bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D\">Examples of, you know, are things like, you know, \"I don't think the kids should be watching the screens, you know, including, you know, us.\" So she doesn't want me looking at my phone around the kids. You know, she makes these... You know, I say things and she makes these really, you know, weird responses. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D1\">I'll say something sarcastic to Lucille (ph), the two year old and she has to explain to me that Lucille doesn't get sarcasm. You know? Things like that. Ian (ph)... You know, I was playing with Ian and Lucille and occasionally one of them cries for one reason or another, you know. And Ian was holding <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D2\">the door so Lucille couldn't get out. I had done that previous so he was doing it to her. And she was giggling on the other side. She thought it was very funny. And, you know, after a while, I'm like, \"Okay, let her out before, you know, she stops giggling.\" And so he lets her out and and she's, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D3\">know, they open the door and she's literally just walking out the door, kind of stumbles a little bit and bangs her head on the door. So this has nothing to do with the game we were playing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20151\">CLIENT: And Jess gets all upset about it being the game we're playing. And I'm just like, \"The girl tripped and hit her head.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20153\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20155\">CLIENT: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20157\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20159\">CLIENT: So it's just, you know, every little thing that I do there's some comment, there's some, you know... Ian decides to tell her that I let them stay up until ten o'clock at night. You know... Just... She's like, \"Well, you know, he's high energy when he doesn't get enough sleep.\" I'm just like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201591\">\"He's high energy when he gets enough sleep.\" You know? So it's... I left... On Sunday I left because I just couldn't take it anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2015D\">CLIENT: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2015F\">THERAPIST: And it's her. It's not them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, it's totally her. Now the good thing is that, you know, Lucille is... You know, I took her shopping. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20163\">THERAPIST: Oh, terrific.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20165\">CLIENT: You know, she went in my car and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20167\">THERAPIST: That's great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20169\">CLIENT: We're improving on that front. So the ability to get them away from her...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2016D\">CLIENT: ...would eliminate that issue. Something kind of similar to that is that we just got a report from the financial aid people how much they...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2016F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20171\">CLIENT: ...how much they think you can spend on education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20173\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20175\">CLIENT: And they came up with about three thousand dollars. We applied for the Friends. They came up with thirty one thousand dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20177\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20179\">CLIENT: So, you know, it's nineteen grand for the school. They'll give up to fifty percent. So, to me, three thousand's a good number because we clearly qualify for financial aid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2017B\">THERAPIST: That sounds great actually. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2017D\">CLIENT: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2017F\">THERAPIST: I mean, there's still a shortfall if they're only, or gap if they're only coming up with half of it. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20181\">CLIENT: If your main concern is getting Ian into the school.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099788\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20183\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20185\">CLIENT: I'm looking at the repercussions of Ian getting into the school. Number one, they're going to move. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20187\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20189\">CLIENT: So that makes them a little farther away from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2018D\">CLIENT: But, you know, if Jess's on me now about the phone and the TV and all this crap, it's only going to escalate when he goes to the school. They are really, you know, no TV, no phone, no, you know, no electricity, no indoor plumbing. You know? I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20191\">CLIENT: So I think this passive aggressiveness is only going to get worse if he goes there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20193\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20195\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20197\">CLIENT: Are you trying to come up with something funny or professional? Because you got a smirk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20199\">THERAPIST: I do have... I don't think it's a smirk. I'm smiling. I'm not smirking. Maybe a little... I've got to ask. Like what school do you think would be best for Ian? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2019B\">CLIENT: He's smart. He can excel wherever he goes. I like the curricula at that school. You know, they've got music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2019F\">CLIENT: They've got a couple of, two languages you take starting in kindergarten, first grade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201A3\">CLIENT: Has a lot of opportunity to do the arts he likes. Like when he goes to the Camp, he likes, he's like the only guy doing the plays and skits or whatever. He went to the Camp for the break and they had a talent show and he won the talent show by singing \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\" in French.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201A5\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Rock on Ian.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201A7\">CLIENT: So, you know, that's the kind of stuff he loves to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201AB\">CLIENT: And the school is going to feed right into that. So, you know, that I don't have a problem with. My problem is with Jess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201AD\">THERAPIST: So you think he'll get a better education there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201AF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B1\">THERAPIST: It'll be better for him personally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Okay. That seems to me like a very important part of the decision. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. If you say so. I just have... At some point, you know, I'm trying to be, you know, not start anything but I have a feeling at some point I'm going to snap. I came very close.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201BB\">CLIENT: I got very upset with the head banging and kind of jumped on her a little bit about, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201BD\">THERAPIST: The head banging?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201BF\">CLIENT: Lucille banged her head...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201C3\">CLIENT: ...and blamed me for...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That totally makes sense. I just didn't understand you the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201C7\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:17:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

No, I hear you. You're not talking about the school. You're talking about you're really going to lose your shit with Jess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah and I... You know, me, yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201D3\">CLIENT: The first episode of Criminal Minds came on at four o'clock. I skipped the midnight episode. I fell asleep during the eleven o'clock episode. I watched all the other episodes. This is what I did yesterday. You know? Blew off work... I just, you know. So I watched TV. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201D5\">You know? And the idea that he's going to, both of them are going to come over to my house at some point and not watch TV is... I mean, I've got nothing else to do with the kids. For me, that's... You know? Ian gets to watch adult programming, commercial TV, you know, all the things he's not allowed to, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N201D9\">CLIENT: Stay up late.

Like I've got to drive <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N202271\">down to (inaudible at 00:23:25) to make some copies and then there's the, you know, things I could do that aren't deadline, you know, but there's not really a whole lot that I'm going into the office and trying to do some back office stuff, clean the apartment. Maybe I should do laundry today. I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N202272\">know. I'll do it tomorrow. But, you know, I've got no clean dress shirts because I've been sweating.

I get twenty four hours to say yes or no. And then, if she says... And she does the same thing.

It's scary enough doing closings there. So that I said no and nothing happened. Well this time they show an attractive woman who lives in Hartford.

And it's a woman who has, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2024D1\">you know, her picture is her with her daughter or her son or I don't know what it was. I'm like, \"Fuck Hartford.\" But then I'm like, you know, \"You're desperate. So maybe... You know, you've got friends in Hartford, you know, I mean, just to, maybe just to get out and practice or whatever.\" You know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2024D2\">So I hit yes and it tells me I've got to subscribe.

And this morning I did my profile which is just awful, you know, just me attempting to be funny without really giving any sort of substance. You know? And they had this quick match thing where it brings up a woman and her profile and gives you five <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2024F1\">stars. You can either skip it or rate them and they say four or fives means that you're into them. Well this woman comes up who, she lives in Manchester, you know, late thirties, seems attractive. She wrote like a fucking, you know, autobiography for her thing. It was very well written and, you know... <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2024F2\">Which is intimidating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20251\">And I was like, \"Well, she's really not a five.\" You know? She's... And I don't know what I'm rating on. Is it physical appearance? You know? So I want to do a four but then I'm like, \"Okay. Is a four going to be offensive? Because you're not a five.\" And then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20253\">THERAPIST: Can she see the rating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20255\">CLIENT: Yeah. \"So and so rated you such and such.\" Because once again, someone from, you know, Vermont rated me a four. Whatever. I don't know. But then if she was interested, you know... Or I could just message the woman, you know. But I'm like, \"I don't know what to say in these messages.\" Do I come <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202551\">out and say, you know, \"I've never done this before. You know? I'm going to just swing for the fences here. You know? Do you want to get married?\" (LAUGHTER) And then, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20257\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20259\">CLIENT: ...is that an okay icebreaker?

But that's their nature, I guess. So... I don't have any pictures of myself. I have a few but my hair's like sticking up in them, you know. I guess I could take a picture of myself and post it. I don't want someone to be surprised when they meet me in person and and they see I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202C11\">bald.
