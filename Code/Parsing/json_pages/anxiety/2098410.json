I\u2019m trying to remember when I last saw you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You were having a good week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I was having a good week. I think I told you it was like yoga.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yes, I recall that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve changed my mind about that. (sniggers)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Ten days ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Ten days ago. Josh had his procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Was that just this morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: That was Wednesday. Gosh, what do I want to tell you? (chuckles) I was kind of [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:34). I had made two appointments this week. Whenever school ends, I\u2019m always in trouble. I\u2019m always in trouble all throughout college. I\u2019ll come home the day after finals and generally freak <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">out because, all of a sudden, I have nothing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a huge release.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh, my gosh. And I generally start having [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:57) my father so I almost always make my little brother go and take a walk around the lake. I would freak out to him for about an hour. He\u2019d tell me I was crazy and then we\u2019d go have ice cream. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: What would you freak out about to him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I\u2019d just be really frustrated. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with myself and I\u2019d be frustrated with my father for whatever. I don\u2019t know. Just talk, talk, talk for an hour about whatever is going on. It would take me a day or two to unwind. But I don\u2019t know, I had really started feeling all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">that. All my friends were going away. We had a couple of holiday parties which were kind of stressful and not super fun, everyone left, and Josh started getting really worried about his procedure. We went to the gym on Saturday morning. This is like a week ago. I was feeling kind of icky and he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">feeling kind of icky. I started having a crying fit at the gym and then walked out. We were going to go shopping afterwards so I walked over to the store, which is just around the corner; and I proceeded to have this mental breakdown in the middle of the store, which was really embarrassing. I was hysterically <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">crying. Josh came and found me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: What were the tears expressing? Were you angry, sad, frustrated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Well, I mean quite often we go to the gym and lately it\u2019s been great because we\u2019ve gone with somebody else. He doesn\u2019t feel good and I try not to let it bother me too much. He just does whatever he needs to do, whatever he feels like doing or goes home. For some reason I just couldn\u2019t handle <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">it because my friends are all gone. The guy I go to the gym with won\u2019t be back until like February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You were disappointed in the workout or the experience of going to the gym.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I knew if I could just do my own thing I would feel better because that always happens. I just couldn\u2019t handle it. I just got all wrapped up in how it was going to be like last year all over again. My family just left, so nobody was around except Josh\u2019s mother, who has been really strange and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">I\u2019m really angry at her or her not being helpful. I don\u2019t know. I just got really worried that the school thing was not going to work out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: So feeling kind of abandoned and scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: It sounds like fear was a big piece of that because as I said that your eyes got wide. There\u2019s a lot to be fearful of. You don\u2019t know how things \u2013 you certainly didn\u2019t know how things were going to go Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like there\u2019s something else happening. I don\u2019t know. My mom called me. I feel really bad. She has guilt, I think from not knowing what was going on for so long, and I think she feels really bad that I have to handle the stuff with Josh anyway. She called me like six times when he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">was in the hospital. They\u2019re in Washington visiting my grandma, which makes me feel bad. I mean I\u2019m sleeping now. I\u2019m not totally miserable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You feel badly that you didn\u2019t go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: No. I don\u2019t feel badly that I didn\u2019t go, I feel badly that she feels bad that she\u2019s not here. They had the trip planned. They left the day before \u2013 so maybe she was around. I don\u2019t remember exactly what the timing is. They were gone before his surgery. Anyway, then I got over it and it was fine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">Josh was very good. He came and found me and said it was going to be fine. We just ended up \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what we did. We just did some fun things that day. It was so fine. Then the day before his surgery, first of all, his mom hadn\u2019t asked anything or said anything about it. I wasn\u2019t feeling very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">confrontational, so I didn\u2019t say much to her about it. The morning of, we were up at 5:00 AM to get him to the hospital really early.  She woke up because the dogs were going nuts and she starts asking me for the jumper cables in the car because she\u2019s leaving for Milwaukee Thursday. I\u2019m like you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B3\">got to be kidding me? We\u2019re going to the hospital and I\u2019m finding the jumper cables. I was just steaming because it took us a half an hour to get ready and she was just putzing around making coffee.(chuckles) I go, \u201cWell, wish us luck.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cGood luck.\u201d I was furious. At least she can take care <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B4\">of the dogs all day and I don\u2019t have to come back, although in retrospect it would have been nice because then I would have had an excuse to leave the hospital. I\u2019ve just been furious all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You really want her priorities to be more aligned with what you feel like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Or just say something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Acknowledge what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: \u201cMake you dinner when you get back,\u201d or just anything. Give her son a hug \u2013 whatever. I think she\u2019s really scared. She once told me in the car, which was really uncomfortable, how her other son who\u2019s a drug addict and in jail, I think, and if he died she would be sad; but if Josh died, she wouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">be able to go on.  So I know she cares. She just shows it less when it\u2019s needed than even regularly. So I was just still so mad at her. Anyway, the procedure went well as a procedure, but when they went in there, his heart hasn\u2019t been healing at all. He finally came out of it and I saw him and everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">was so much better than before. He didn\u2019t get super sick or \u2013 like he wouldn\u2019t stop bleeding last time. Everything went fine. They went in there hoping that his heart \u2013 it\u2019s enlarged \u2013 hoping that it had shrunk by this time and it hasn\u2019t, so they did what they could but the doctor came to and told us, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">basically, that it\u2019s just going to have to be managed, probably. He\u2019ll probably need more procedures. Who knows. We didn\u2019t talk excessively about it, but he left the hospital. Actually, they got him into rhythm by the end of the procedure, which is good.  I was hanging out with him. We were sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200434\">watching some TV and he had his dinner, and then he started bleeding all over, which was really traumatizing. He had all the nurses running, freaking out because he wouldn\u2019t stop bleeding, and then he went back out of rhythm because his blood pressure dropped. He didn\u2019t even notice. He was oozing blood <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200435\">all over the place. It was really gross.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: That must have been really scary to see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t do well with blood. I\u2019m usually the one bleeding, for some reason. He takes care of things. He\u2019s fine. Yeah, the world\u2019s not good. So then I left him and . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: How long was he in the hospital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: He had to stay overnight instead of coming home the night because of that, (chuckles) which was good because if it had happened at home it would have been ten times worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel a little safer. He was there with people who can respond immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, other than that, though, he bounced back much quicker than last time. He\u2019s trying really hard to show me how much happier and better he is, but I\u2019m really struggling . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: That causes uncertainty because his heart stops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. His doctor said this is just going to go on and on. If his heart hasn\u2019t tripped by now, it\u2019s just probably not going to. He\u2019ll just have to deal with it for the rest of his life, which is kind of the worst-case scenario, besides something horrible happening and him needing something really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">serious like a transplant or something really terrible. This is kind of the worst-case scenario out of this procedure that could happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m so sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: We haven\u2019t really talked about that part. He asked me about it a whole bunch of times. He was like, \u201cAre you really sad about what the doctor said?\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to start bringing it up that I was sad. I don\u2019t want him to worry about it, I think maybe a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot to take on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: So then we got home and I got home really late. His mom actually texted me once or twice while I was at the hospital asking if everything was okay. I was really happy.  I was like, \u201cOkay, she realized what\u2019s going on.\u201d I texted her back and said this is what happened and then I told her again <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">he wasn\u2019t coming home. Then I didn\u2019t get home until kind of late and she appeared to be asleep. I went to bed and I heard her getting up so I went out and called her name. Then she appeared to be asleep again and I wondered if she was avoiding me. The next morning, she was gone for work at 7:30 AM and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">didn\u2019t answer my call. I called her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It does feel like she\u2019s avoiding you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: I could be reading into it, but it felt like she was avoiding me. Then she came home around 3:00 to get ready to go to Milwaukee and I was exhausted. I was lying on the couch and she asked me if I was okay. She didn\u2019t say anything about Josh. Oh, my gosh. I almost just lost it, but I didn\u2019t. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\"> Later I was making dinner and she came in and said something about Josh and how if he had just been taking care of himself this wouldn\u2019t be happening; so it was his fault. Maybe the things he did led to this happening, but he\u2019s not doing anything wrong right now. It\u2019s not his fault. And then she said <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">something like, \u201cWell, at least you know it\u2019s not genetic.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you saying here? Are you saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t leave him\u2019? What are you saying?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d I think is what she was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d Of course, his dad died of \u2013 his heart exploded they said because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F3\">of a cocaine overdose, which generally doesn\u2019t happen so I would say there\u2019s definitely \u2013 not last year, but the history before was \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with her. I didn\u2019t want to totally look for bad. Our living situation is really incorrigible, but now I think she\u2019s gone until <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F4\">New Years so I\u2019m stuck again caring for him and he\u2019s being so sweet. He\u2019s like, \u201coh, don\u2019t do this\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d, but he can\u2019t lift anything or take care of the dogs or do anything. I\u2019m not going to have him bleeding out all over the house just because he wants to help and not make me feel bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: What are his restrictions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: He has to let his wound heal, so he can\u2019t do any vigorous activity. That\u2019s all. I dealt with the fact that this is now like a \u2013 he\u2019ll never get another one of these procedures. He wouldn\u2019t do this again, but it will either be something worse or they\u2019ll shock him back into rhythm every month <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">or whatever, however often it\u2019s needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something that goes from being something that felt potentially curable to being a chronic, manageable issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Who knows \u2013 we were going to plan a vacation. We can\u2019t really plan a vacation until they figure out what\u2019s going to happen. Maybe we\u2019ll never be able to plan a vacation.  Who knows. We\u2019ll have to talk to the doctor in a month because he can\u2019t go on like this actually forever because the drugs <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">he\u2019s on are toxic, which is the point of this procedure. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to say. I\u2019m going to be dreading it all month, I\u2019m sure and I\u2019m sure he will be, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: I know that you were really counting on having some support and not having to handle all of these questions and all the care all by yourself, having his mom around thinking she would shoulder some of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean my mom will when she gets back. Maybe I could figure out a way to confront his mom and be like, \u201cLook, you need to do something with this. Anything.\u201d I had dinner with a friend of mine the night before, which was really good. I almost canceled on her so I could just sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">pull out, but I didn\u2019t. She actually works over at the hospital in a different unit.  She sent me some messages that day and a lot of people \u2013 I decided I was just going to email all of his friends. He told me that was okay, so I emailed all of his friends and there were messages from some of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s wonderful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: That was actually amazing. I didn\u2019t think it would be, but then I was sitting there and getting random messages from people saying \u201cgood luck\u201d. It was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I think that show of support is really wonderful. It\u2019s nice to also be reminded that your expectations are normal and that his mom is not meeting kind of the typical expectations. Having everyone else remember and keep it in mind and offer support kind of reminds you that yeah, she should <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">be doing those things, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, I got a message from her as if she was just another one of my friends that knew about it. That\u2019s his mother. I\u2019m okay if you\u2019re terrified. She\u2019s 60 years old. I mean, come on. She had a lot of stuff happen to her. I would think she\u2019d be able to deal with it by now, especially for her son. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">Even if she is terrified, how can she watch me do all this without offering to help. She laughs when we asked her to ship some boxes for us. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Who are you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: How does he respond to this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Not as angrily as I would have thought. He\u2019s just like, \u201cOh, whatever.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s not surprised by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: He\u2019s not surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a combination for you of being surprised and angry, whereas I wonder if this is somewhat in line with how she\u2019s responded to different things throughout his life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: I think she thinks this is all his fault and she doesn\u2019t want to take any responsibility for it. He told me when he got his first ever procedure, cardioversion, to get him back into rhythm the very first time when he was living with her, she was at a training and he took a cab to the hospital <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">and back. (chuckling) That\u2019s awful. I was just going on and on to him. What would you do if I wasn\u2019t here and she was? He was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019d take a cab. That\u2019s what I did before.\u201d Unbelievable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Wow. He\u2019s had to be really independent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I think he just doesn\u2019t expect anything from her, nor has he. She\u2019s done a lot of bad things to him and I\u2019m confused by his feelings towards her because he was happy to have her live here. He seems to care about her and wants to help her. I don\u2019t understand. He has feelings like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">towards his stepfather, who was abusive. He says lots of things about how he helped him and how he wants to be like him in some ways and then never wants to see him again. He appreciates what he learned from him, and yet he also kind of ruined his life in a way. It\u2019s really confusing. His mom did kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200832\">of the same thing in a way, less seriously. I don\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really hard to understand how someone can have such conflicted feelings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s conflicted or if he just somehow manages to separate the two or if it\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: So how have you been holding up in the wake of all of this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so much better than last time and I guess I haven\u2019t dealt with what might come yet . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well you can\u2019t. Part of that is dealing day by day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: I mean, today was the first day I sort of got myself going. Yesterday I spent most of the day on the couch with him, which I\u2019m not sure was the best plan. (laughs) I\u2019m feeling clearer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Thank goodness you got here by 9:30, which was actually a good thing. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Good. Got to go home, give the dogs a bath . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Maybe we should do that all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: No, really. I\u2019m used to going back to school, regardless of vacation. I wish it wasn\u2019t vacation. I don\u2019t do well with vacations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to go from having such structure to not having structure; and the structure really does provide a good distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I used to know what was going to happen and what was expected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Because you didn\u2019t have the typical exams-type thing, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Is this the first time you haven\u2019t had classes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Well, no. Last year, this didn\u2019t happen because I was such a mess to begin with. Then it got worse, for sure, over the break because I was feeling more isolated and more upset that I was having nothing to do and yet not sleeping. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Maybe we could spend some time thinking about what can be the structure, since you don\u2019t have the typical expectations. You can certainly fill some stuff in \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to all be work \u2013 to give yourself some structure so you do get up and going, that you still have flexibility to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">care of Josh when he recovers. What would you like it to look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: If I can just go to school every day. I just need something to get me started and that\u2019s not . . . [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:36)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Have some [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:41) scheduled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Schedule things. I scheduled a whole bunch of social things this week, which was great. I canceled some of them because of the overnight in the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: These are things you scheduled to make up for stuff that you canceled, or are you canceling stuff now? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:59) I had planned on until the hospital, and then I canceled every class, which is fine. I don\u2019t know. There is some sort of fine line between trying to do too much and sort of wallowing, which is definitely the past few days. Gosh, I just think about if I was still working <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">what I would have done. In grad school I can sort of pretend I\u2019m not doing anything as long as no one notices. That\u2019s probably good and bad for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you\u2019re doing nothing? Well, for three days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) No, I mean, I\u2019m helping Josh. I\u2019m not overstressing myself, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re taking some sick time for family leave. You\u2019re allowed to use your sick time for family. You don\u2019t punch a clock, but that\u2019s sort of the idea of taking some time off to help your boyfriend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I had to read a paper for my advisor and mail it back and tell him I can\u2019t get to it for three days because I\u2019ll have to [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:14) my work and I haven\u2019t gotten a response from him. Hopefully I\u2019ll get a response from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Can you focus on work? If you were to try to read that paper today, would you be able to do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Today? Probably. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: How has your sleep been? Has that been affected by this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, last night I had horrible dreams and woke up in the middle of the night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Do you remember any of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, my God. I woke up in a panic. (chuckles) I think I was at Berkeley, where I lived for a summer and Josh was taking me to some \u2013 this is so embarrassing \u2013 to some meeting of supernatural creatures or something. I was the only one who wasn\u2019t . . . (sniggers) They went around in a circle <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">and asked everyone what their supernatural power was. They made me go home because . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Because you didn\u2019t have one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so Josh had to drive me home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: He was needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: He wanted to get back before they left to see whatever they were doing. And then he dropped me off and then I got lost and tried to find the rest of the way back home. I ended up in some scary neighborhood. I remember \u2013 I forget exactly what happened, but I woke up in a sweat, just terrified.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: What were you terrified of? Because you were lost and couldn\u2019t find your way home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve had dreams before of getting lost in some terrible part of town or something. Then I woke up and it was like 4:00 AM and Josh had apparently gotten up half an hour before to watch TV on the couch, which is so disconcerting because he couldn\u2019t sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Does he often have trouble sleeping? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, he had a small bit of trouble sleeping right before the procedure. If he\u2019s really stressed he\u2019ll wake up really early. He had taken a whole lot of drugs last night. It probably just caused him to wake up early.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I think it makes sense before procedures to be really anxious about it. That seems within the realm of normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Actually, it was really nice. While I was waiting to see him in his hospital room, I was waiting with this family. This was sad. It was six family members waiting for the grandfather, who was getting some horrible quadruple bypass or something. (chuckles) But they come from all over and I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D71\">like where are my six family members? One of the women was telling me how she\u2019s been having the same symptoms of her father and how she really hopes it\u2019s just anxiety. \u201cYes, it\u2019s just anxiety,\u201d although she had some weird diseases. Anyway, it was nice to talk to them. They invited me to have dinner <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D72\">with them and everything. So that was nice.  (chuckles) Happens to other people, I guess. Even really old people with really old parents have the same troubles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It would be really nice to feel like you had people rally around you the way they had each other. It highlights the role that his mom is not taking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it was nice just having my mother call me. And now I feel bad that she\u2019s guilty. I know that this time she would have been there, probably driving me crazy all day asking me tons of questions. It was nice. She knew this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it makes a big difference being able to get those supportive emails and phone calls. Someone can help take care of you while you take care of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yep. And they will eventually. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I wonder in what ways you feel lost in your real life, since it seems to be that this is a scary theme in your nightmares. This isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve been lost in a nightmare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep either for a little while just thinking about him and the doctor, his mom. I would really like to figure out what to say to her because I can\u2019t just . . . I need to say something to her, but I also don\u2019t want to cause [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:34) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">tension in the house, either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: It seems like there is some tension in the house if she\u2019s avoiding you, pretending to be asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: I could have just made that all up, but my mom wouldn\u2019t have let me go to sleep if she heard me get up. She\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d (chuckles) And maybe she just wanted to leave me pee. She was walking out the door finally to go to Milwaukee and she said to Josh without even looking at him, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">\u201cTake care of yourself. I love you,\u201d as she was walking out the door. There\u2019s definitely something. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m making it up. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s something happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: So maybe you feel kind of lost in your relationship with her, like what is your role really supposed to be between her and Josh? It\u2019s a little bit confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, like what am I doing with this guy who\u2019s got this family? I love him so much, but this is just so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t fit into the expectation of what you had of what it would be like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: I was just thinking how sad it is that we haven\u2019t had any fun for a really long time. I really hope that we can eventually, sometime, some day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: You want to have some normalcy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I got pretty upset at the last holiday party we went to for my department. Josh knows a bunch of people. Everyone is making all of these plans, inviting us to stuff. My department is sometimes really clicky, almost like middle-schooly, which I guess happens at work, too. I couldn\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">handle it. (chuckles) I was starting to feel like a completely separate, kind of like how I felt all last year. Everyone is making all their pretty holiday happy plans and I come up blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re having a very different experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I spent a little time talking to a friend about a project I\u2019m going to take on, which I\u2019m really excited about. Josh wandered off and didn\u2019t come back. He just clearly didn\u2019t want to participate and couldn\u2019t . . . like being social is just too much, I guess. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F71\">know where I\u2019m going with this exactly, but it\u2019s too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like really what you\u2019re talking about is different ways in which you feel like things just aren\u2019t going the way you envisioned. You envisioned being one of those people in the lab, being able to make your holiday plans, plan vacations, be able to look forward with some sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F91\">of certainty to what you could expect, have a family and potential in-laws that worked in a way that was something similar to what you know about family. It is so different from your family, so different from what you wish your family would be when you think about a more perfect version. There are just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F92\">so many ways in which things aren\u2019t the way you envisioned. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yep. Yep. Oh, my gosh. Maybe it was this morning I started going, \u201cHow am I ever going to have a family with Josh?\u201d We can\u2019t really do anything in case he has to go to the hospital. How can we ever really build a life? Maybe it\u2019s not going to be this bad and the doctor will tell us that it won\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">be that terrible [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:14) and it probably won\u2019t be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to wait until that appointment time to feel like you have some answers, until you find out what you\u2019re allowed to hope for. Do you question whether you want to stay with him? Or is it just a question of what staying with him looks like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: Gosh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to leave at the moment, which is confusing because what am I going to do \u2013 just take care of him for the rest of our lives?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: You could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah, I could. I don\u2019t know. That just seems crazy. (pause)  I don\u2019t know. (pause) It may be worth it. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an option. Also leaving is an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Yep. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re both hard. I wish you had an easier decision to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: He was freaking about again about his mother and her finances a little while ago and he said something about how she probably won\u2019t have to worry too much about retirement because she\u2019s probably not going to live that long anyway. He\u2019s worried about his grandma, her mom, died in her 70\u2019s because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">she was obese and didn\u2019t take care of herself and was really unhealthy. I\u2019m pretty sure her problems run in the family. I\u2019m pretty sure. That\u2019s horrible, which is part of why I want to get her this gym membership, which is not going to work I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not going to work, at least given my <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B2\">family\u2019s experiences trying to get someone to do stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s very hard trying to make people do things that you want them to do. Even change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m like how long is he going to live? He\u2019s going to die on me of something, probably in his 60\u2019s. Gosh, I just wish I could get some time alone with the doctor to be like . . . Oh, my gosh. And I almost lost it, too, with the doctor, who is really nice and amazing. He doesn\u2019t usually pay too <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F1\">much attention to me during these things. He includes me but he was like patting my arm and just being a little . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: Getting to know you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Well, I was like are you trying to tell me something here? Do you feel really bad for me? I probably read into it a little too much, but it was just really surprising. A few times he gave me a little back rub or something. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: Do you know what rights you have to talk to a doctor or get access as a girlfriend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t. Probably none. Do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a little bit different in mental health than in medical health. The laws are more stringent in mental health with regard to rights to privacy and confidentiality. Since you are really primary caretaker here, I don\u2019t know if there is something that Josh can sign so you can get more information. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201191\">And it\u2019s not that you want information about whether or not how to make a decision about how to envision the future, but you\u2019re also the person that takes care of him at home, helps him make decisions, will probably be involved in making treatment decisions, things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. They gave him a health care proxy form so that if he\u2019s a vegetable I can make decisions for him. He wanted me to be on that, not his mother. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: That makes sense. You\u2019re the person there at the hospital with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: If you were married you would be his health care proxy. That\u2019s typically the way it goes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even know if they have his mother\u2019s number. I get the phone calls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s not so that you can make decisions for him. Really what you want to do is sit down and have a conversation with him so that he\u2019s made the decisions now and you just have to follow them, carry them out, because it\u2019s really hard to make those decisions for somebody else. And it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201251\">have to be such an extreme circumstance. Unable to respond to stimuli in a coma is the worst-case scenario, obviously, but there may also be times when they go in and see that his heart is enlarged and it\u2019s a question about making a decision about this way or that way. Before you\u2019re the proxy sit down <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201252\">and have some of those conversations with what are his wishes? What would he like? So that you know you\u2019re making the choices to the best of your ability that he would make. Take some of the pressure off of you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20124-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20124-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: We haven\u2019t had that conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: Most people your age are not having to make these kinds of decisions and have these kinds of conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yep. I think I can say in front of him to the doctor at the appointment, \u201cWhat do you expect his life to be like?\u201d as long as I warn Josh before. I think the fact that he\u2019s trying to be really happy . . . I don\u2019t know how happy he really is, but he\u2019s not super good at hiding that kind of thing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B1\">I think it will be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">THERAPIST: It seems like a really good question. What is the expected prognosis? What is the course of this illness and the course of treatments and managing it look like? It seems like a really good question. Doctors don\u2019t have a crystal ball, either, so they have trouble predicting and the predictions <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D1\">might not be right, but maybe a little bit more informed than what you\u2019re imagining on your own. I would hope they\u2019re more informed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: This procedure stinks. They\u2019ve only been doing it for like 30 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: So they don\u2019t have a ton of information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: It seems like you\u2019re actually holding up pretty well in the face of what you had to deal with this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: I mean I don\u2019t know why taking care of yourself is so difficult, but I\u2019m trying to do a better job. I\u2019m definitely doing a better job than before. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard. Even in normal life it\u2019s so hard. You think it would be easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: What do you think makes it hard for you to do the things that are taking care of you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know exactly. I don\u2019t know why exactly it\u2019s easier not to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve had a lot of experience meeting other people\u2019s expectations, doing the assignments that are made in school, getting good grades in high school and college. There haven\u2019t been a lot of times where you\u2019ve been the one to decide what\u2019s important about you. You\u2019ve been meeting all those <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D1\">external expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: In light of taking care of you, maybe we should do some relaxation. It\u2019s probably something you haven\u2019t made time for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: Well, unless you count napping on the couch all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">THERAPIST: Different. (laughs) There\u2019s actually a difference between relaxing and sleeping. Sleeping is very important, but giving you a chance to be awake and calm is important, too. So let\u2019s do that so you get a chance to do that. I think we were scheduled for next week at 9:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:18) my calendar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">THERAPIST: (laughs) It didn\u2019t cost me anything, even though I had to walk in the rain twice. I saw your number and I was like, \u201cShit. Did I do something?\u201d I looked at my calendar and, no, I\u2019m where I\u2019m supposed to be according to my calendar. I wish it was a nicer day for you to have to do extra walking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201491\">So next Friday, 9:30. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">Let yourself close your eyes. Find a pace for breathing that feels comfortable for you. Let your body relax and settle into the chair in a comfortable position. (pause) As you begin to get relaxed and calm down, let your breathing slow down, extending your inhales and your exhales just a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B1\">so it still feels comfortable and allows you to be even more relaxed. (pause) Work at your own pace, matching movements to your breath. Whenever you\u2019re ready to inhale squeeze your eyes tightly shut, noticing where that brings tension to your face. When you\u2019re ready to exhale relax your eyes, letting <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B2\">them stay gently closed, repeating that as you inhale squeezing your eyes tightly shut. And as you exhale relax your eyes, letting them be gently closed. On your next breath in you\u2019re going to squeeze your teeth tightly together, clenching your jaw, noticing where that brings tension to your jaw, your <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B3\">neck and your face. When you\u2019re ready to exhale you\u2019re going to drop your jaw, letting your teeth come apart, repeating that, clenching your jaw as you inhale and releasing as you exhale. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">On your next breath in you\u2019re going to drop your chin towards your chest, noticing where that brings tension on your neck and your throat. When you\u2019re ready to exhale you\u2019re going to let your head float up to a neutral position, bowing forward as you inhale and letting your head float up as you exhale. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D1\">Tipping your head over to one side, era towards your shoulder notice the tension in your neck and then let your head float up to a neutral position as you exhale, tipping your head the other way as you inhale slowly and lifting it up as you exhale. In hale and shrug your shoulders up towards your ears, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D2\">noticing the tension in your shoulders, neck and back; and releasing them all the way down as you exhale, repeating as you shrug them off as you inhale and releasing as you exhale. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">On your next breath in you\u2019re going to bend your arms bringing your hands towards your shoulders, noticing the tension in your biceps. Exhale and let your hands drop all the way to your waist. Inhale and bend up. Exhale and release. Inhale and squeeze tight fists, noticing the tension in your hands <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F1\">and forearms. Exhale and release. Inhale and squeeze. Exhale and release. On your next breath in tighten your abdominal wall, bringing your belly button towards your spine. As you exhale release your muscles. Let yourself take a full, deep breath, belly soft. Inhale and squeeze. Exhale and release. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F2\">On your next breath in you squeeze your knees tightly together, feeling tension in your inner thighs. Exhale and release, letting your legs come apart. Inhale and squeeze your knees together as hard as you can. Exhale and release all the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">On your next breath in straighten your legs, bringing your feet up off the floor, noticing tension in your thighs or your hips. When you\u2019re ready to exhale drop your feet down, letting your legs relax. Inhale, lift and straighten. Exhale, release. Inhale and flex your feet so your toes come up off the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201511\">floor, feeling tension in your shins and your ankles. When you\u2019re ready to exhale let your feet relax. Inhale and flex, bringing your toes back towards you. Exhale, release. Reversing that as you inhale pressing your toes down into the floor, feeling tension in your calves. Exhale, release, let your <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201512\">toes drop down. Inhale, point those toes down as hard as you can. Exhale and release, letting your feet relax. Inhale and scan your body, noticing any place where tension has crept back. Think about squeezing that space tight and then exhale, release, letting your body relax just a little bit more, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201513\">repeating that as many times as you need to, noticing the places where you\u2019ve brought tension back into your body. Notice it without judgment and then let it go with your breath, letting your body be relaxed. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20150-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20150-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098410\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">Also notice the thoughts that have stuck in your head.

Thoughts can come back to you and you can acknowledge them and let them go, giving yourself the peaceful space for now. (pause) Let yourself take a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201531\">more deep breaths at your own pace, almost memorizing this feeling of being relaxed so that you can come back to it at any time by taking a deep breath. Whenever you feel ready, let yourself come back to the room at your own pace.
