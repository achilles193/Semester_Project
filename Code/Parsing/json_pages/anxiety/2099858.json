(Pause) So it's been a tough day. Yesterday was a pretty tough day. And I'm reluctant to talk to you about it. Because, I know that at some point you have to send me to the hospital and I really don't want to go to the hospital. And I don't know where that point is. I haven't hurt myself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">But, (Pause) you know, it's been a day I want-it's been, I have really wanted to kill myself. And I feel like that it just came out of nowhere. Or not exactly nowhere, it doesn't come out of nowhere. But, I feel like it came on very suddenly. (Chuckle) You know, and that's died down somewhat, but I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">still having a tough time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">(Pause from [0:01:29.5] to [0:01:36.9]) I haven't really told James about it. You know, but last night I-after about six or seven, I just said, you know things are getting on towards crisis. I really need to deal with that. And what that means is that I really need to just be watching TV and distracting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">myself. Because it's like, I can't think about anything. It just gets overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">(Pause from [0:02:21.2] to [0:02:35.0]) At one point, I went into the kitchen and got a knife and kind of put it up against my wrist and then I said, okay, that's enough of that and put it back. Went on with my evening. (Pause) It's not necessarily that I want to die so much as I want to have some control <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">over my life. (Crying) Or feel like I do. And don't want to be in the situation that I'm in. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Or more normally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: In a lot of ways that you really don't have control over it. Which is very difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I still can't quite, I can't shake the feeling that I ought to have control over feeling this way. You know, I ought to be able to just shut it down. [0:04:00.8]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: (Pause) You know, but it doesn't really shut down. I haven't gotten much work done today. I got a fair amount of work done yesterday. But most of that was in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(Pause from [0:04:18.4] to [0:04:38.9]) Anyway, it seemed like something that you probably needed to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Is there more that you don't want to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: No that's about it. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Do you know what brought it on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I think it was the job stuff. (Pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: What was going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don't know. You know, mostly what I talked to you about yesterday. (Pause) Realizing that you know, James's and my financial situation is getting pretty tight. (Crying) And feeling like I've let him down and like I'm a burden to him. (Pause) You know, on the one hand and feeling like I've <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">sort of done everything right and it's not worked out for me. And the other hand feeling like I can't possibly have done everything right because it hasn't worked out for me. [0:06:01.4]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Sure. I can imagine it could be both. I mean I could feel both ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just, just feeling hopeless. Then I you know went to my first tutoring session with these two high schooler's. And it didn't go terribly but it didn't go as well as I would like it to in an ideal world. Which, when does it. And also, but also I sort of feel like I'm not really qualified <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">to be teaching them some of these skills. I'm not really sure how to proceed, etc., etc. You know, they are really nice girls. Their dad is very nice. I think I would really enjoy working with them. But, I'm not sure how helpful I will be. (Pause) It was-you know the frustrating thing about tutoring <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">is-teaching was like this for the first couple of months and then I sort of go over it. But, you know, I worry and worry and worry, I'm just incredibly anxious and then I go to the session and have a really good time. I feel like I'm doing good and I feel like I'm actually helping. And then I leave, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F3\">feel good about it for about an hour and then I start to second guess myself and worrying about the next time.

(Pause) [0:08:10.6]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: A new way that makes something pretty fraught.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (Pause from [0:08:15.8] to [0:08:41.6]) Yeah, normal (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(Pause from [0:08:43.7] to [0:09:15.3]) I'm dealing with it partly by, (pause) reminding myself that I am in all these relationships with people and I have a responsibility to the people around me. And partly by reminding myself that this comes and also goes. (Pause from [0:09:38.7] to [0:09:58.0])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It's hard work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, I work hard. (Pause from [0:10:06.4] to [0:10:26.4]) Yeah, I've got a pretty tight hold of myself.

Or I'm probably not accurate, worse than usual?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: The only thing that would be different is that James and I talked. Briefly, night before last, and then I said okay, we're going to talk about this again, but I haven't really been up for it. About this being kind of untenable situation. (Pause [0:11:55.3] to [0:12:04.1])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Financially with you not working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Um hm. (Pause from [0:12:05.9] to [0:12:32.0]) So you know, we kind of talked briefly, and said, yes, this is an untenable situation. And then we talked at some point about what would we do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">(Pause from [0:12:47.7] to [0:13:03.0]) None of the, (Pause) none of the pieces seems big enough to account for it. You know, I had like a good week where I didn't really think about suicide at all. Which is a long time for me. (Chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Just to be clear.

(Pause) You know on the one hand this is pretty familiar ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(Pause from [0:14:22.2] to [0:14:37.2]) It sort of feels like, well fuck, now I've got this to deal with. It just feels like bad timing.

About you working and finances and untenability. Because, (Pause from [0:19:48.0] to [0:20:22.1]) Well, I guess I'm concerned that the conclusion is going to be, well you need to get a job. And you're already looking for jobs, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">at least teaching jobs, and you'll feel like you're sort of in an impossible situation. Or, you're supposed to be making something work that you can't make work or something like that. And that will be bad. That will be intolerable. Like-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I mean that's about how I feel. [0:20:58.4] (Chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: But, (Pause from [0:21:03.1] to [0:21:37.5])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Like, you're supposed to bringing in \"X\" hundred more dollars every week than you are to keep things a float and you're not and you can't find a way to do the work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, something like that.

Or something like that. But, (Pause) You know, then, that means cancelling or rescheduling most of my sessions with you. And at least half of my tutoring sessions. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">Which, you know, I'm not looking forward to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">(Pause from [0:24:39.2] to [0:25:02.0])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Do you know how much tutoring you'd have to do to make it work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I haven't worked it out. That's something to talk about. (Pause from [0:25:12.7] to [0:25:27.2]) That'd be good though. (Pause) You know the last couple of days, all of this has been hampered by, like as soon as I start trying to look at the problem practically, I get so overwhelmed by feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">terrible about myself that I just can't even, can't face it. (Pause) Which is frustrating. [0:26:07.1]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Sure.

(Pause from [0:27:24.1] to [0:28:00.2]) I, (Pause) I wonder if this is largely a kind of psychological resistance to getting better.

Okay, well here are my thoughts about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: At (Pause) a kind of, this is allaying the worry about having to go back to the hospital, also may be connected to a wish to go back. Like the part of you that wants to go back. Both because like, you're taken care of in certain ways there. Although, fully not in other ways. Because that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">shows that this isn't fixable and nobody can reach it. (Pause) It can't be controlled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">(Pause from [0:33:12.4] to [0:33:29.4]) And, (Pause) And then I guess kind of on the other side of it, (Pause) it seems pretty hard, like you have this fantasy that you're going to have to do something that you just can't do. Like if this situation is just untenable. You don't have enough money. You're <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">the one who's gotta find a way to make more money. Whatever you're going to have to do is something either you can't do or can't, kind of work you can't find. Like, compared to, is you feel like it's going to be impossible. And like some sense that it isn't just going to be workable. You know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B2\">you'll wind up at a temp job 40 hours a week. You'll have to find one and that will be humiliating and awful, which is was before. And then you'll have to do it, and that will be humiliating and awful. (Chuckle) [0:34:51.4]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">And like, the scenarios you envision seem to me somewhere, like variations on the impossible kind of. I'm extrapolating I guess from what you said I guess obviously. But I guess this is what I have in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: No, I think you're right. [0:35:07.0]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And that it seems to me probably in advance of the fact, I mean (Pause) like, (Pause) you know, maybe it's five or six more hours of tutoring a week. (Pause) You know, you'd make similar money like that plus what you're doing already, to the temp job from hell. Or, you know like, you sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">of don't know the facts. Like how much you're short. And like, when whatever money you are using now is gonna run out. (Pause) And how things changed. I mean James's job is changing in a few months. What that means. Whether there is uncertainty, because he doesn't know what he will do next. Or he'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A12\">make more money, that seems up in the air. So I guess I, (Pause) jumping to these conclusions without sort of knowing the data. And then kind of be unable to think about or look at the data. Buy just imagining that it's all going to be horrible. That sort of sounds a little fishy in a way, if that makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A13\">sense.

Like (Pause) you guys are really short on money, that you're gonna have to make a change somehow, some point soon. And that could involve, likely would involve you doing more work. And you know, it's hard to find the kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">work that you'd want to do, and it's uncertain-you know like, it's all very stressful. I'm not saying that it isn't. But (Pause) imagine that it feels to you pretty like, totalized. (Pause) That to me sort of has like a, a feel or like a whiff of (Pause from [0:38:05.8] to [0:38:28.5])<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">Some of the like, darker, angrier, more depressive, more omnipotent parts of you trying to take over.

Would be that (Pause) I feel like if I'm this sick, a situation is less my fault. (Pause [0:40:19.1] to [0:40:42.7]) You know, I hear what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">I don't know what to say about it, but I hear you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) But your thought is that you would be (Pause) sort of trying to avoid the judgment and punishment you would heap on yourself.

(Chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: But you had a sort of look of, of pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I am.

Before I can see it, there's just this kind of overwhelming <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">sense of it's all horrible and it's all my fault. And you know, this is not in just the last couple of days, it's all the time. (Pause) So I, I don't know how to get to it.
