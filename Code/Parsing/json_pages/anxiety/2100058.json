How's it going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, it looks pretty like, that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: [laughs] [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's very fitting. So I could have totally been here on time. I couldn't get out of bed. I mean, I could get out of bed but I didn't get out of bed. I woke up feeling like shit. I'm just like, uh. I feel very panicky. [pause] It's weird, like I keep going back and forth between feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">pretty good and feeling panicked. I woke up with like heartburn, and like my arm was hurting, so I started getting all like hypochondriac. I feel like I just I really like want to hibernate for a while. Like in June we have this fucking event-I might even cancel it. It's becoming like I can't find anyone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">to really do it. And like one of them, I got an e-mail today that she might be backing out of it. I'm like, \"You know what, I'm tired of this shit.\" An event on a Saturday in Darien is not going to make or break, and I'm just not feeling it. I just want to be left alone and find other avenues to-you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">know. I don't know, I just feel like I want to like have like a quiet life for a little while. That's how I feel. I didn't get in touch with Kelly, but I think I just gotta do that. I don't know what to do. I'm like tortured about it. Like anxious and sad, well, what if I fuck it up, then I don't find <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">another girl like her. I don't know, I'm just tired. [3:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: So maybe all these feelings about actually wanting [inaudible] with her [inaudible]. It's a quieter letting go in a way, it's not just break up. So you get to actually feel what if I don't have someone in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I think and also what's started happening now is I'm starting to be like I think I'm-you know, it's funny, like I've been reading a lot of like Thomas Murden [sp?]. I think like-it's like what am I doing kind of. You know what I mean? Like in some ways I think I need to just suck <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">it up. It's sort of like, look, I don't know if it's a good idea for me to go. And just to be honest, and as much as it sucks just put it out there. And even with the show-it's not that-don't get me wrong, it's like I don't want to do shows. Like, of course I want to do events. But I'm like, \"But what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">am I doing here? Why am I so stressed and so anxious and so-\" You know what I mean? About what? Like a stupid little club in Burlington? Like why don't I just channel that energy into I'll do those shows but-like in other words not getting so hyper-focused on that, and thinking like, \"Oh my god. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">know, what the-\" Like and then getting angry and resentful, like why is this so difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Well, you know what, maybe I just shouldn't organize events around here. I didn't used to do that. But it's like fuck this. I don't want to deal with that. It's like I kinda don't care. I'd rather get out of Darien. If I'm gonna make so much effort and be stressed and nervous I'd rather it'd be something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">bigger where I'm really getting out there, instead of something that really does not make a difference. It's just a fun night. But even if it's sold out what does that mean? It doesn't mean anything around here. You do that in San Diego or somewhere else then yeah, you can say wow, we're building some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">kind of following. But that's not hard here. You know. So it's like, well, it's fucking whatever. Getting all stressed and anxious and dwelling on it, and getting all caught up, and just fuck that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100058\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">So I think all these things are similar in some way. Do you know what I mean? It's like I just need to talk to Kelly, this is how I feel. And it's the same with that. It's like, yeah, I'd love to be there on a Saturday night, but you know what, this is becoming a nightmare. And it's just not worth it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">to me. So let's just cancel this and whatever. Put me on a good bill or something, I don't know. But I don't need this. You know what I mean? Just to quiet my mind. Like this is just-I feel like it's unnecessary-I just feel like I don't need that right now. I don't know if that makes sense but[6:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Just unnecessary [unclear].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just like white noise, that I'm creating in a way. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: It's like, yeah, I really care about Kelly, but something is not working. Do you know what I mean? And I kinda just don't feel like going away for my birthday. I'm stressed, this fucking apartment isn't renting. You know, I can't undo my zipper. So I don't know. But I feel like that's where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">I'm headed, I feel like I need to reallyIn a way that's already what's been happening by default. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: My life has gotten quieter and simpler, you know. I just need to commit to it more and recognize it and take charge of it. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Right. Well, maybe-you know, this metaphor you've used a number of times of getting out of prison, and that the initial rush of you going anywhere you want to go and doing anything you want to do, what if you're going to be with who you want to be with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: So you rush forward into lots of things. But maybe you're just starting on a-maybe you don't want all of these things, even if you could do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Or I want them in the more selective-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, not just like to just in a frenzy, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Maybe you don't want to be the one organizing the events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You'd rather be-you'd want to be at an event, but you don't want to be the one in charge of the event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Just part of getting to know more selectively what actually feels good for you to have in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Instead of everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Right, right. [pause] [8:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: There's a lot of feeling that comes up. I mean, the struggle now for Kelly [unclear] to anything you might say no and let her go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: All the anxiety about now actually having choices and then making a choice-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: -is very different than just being in prison, someone tells you what you have to do and you go do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I think that's easy in a way, you don't have to deal with choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: When you deal with choice-it's good to have choices, but it also means you're gonna say no to things and close some doors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Which is its own kind of anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, and this is the first real breakup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100058\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: In all the other cases I've just left in a frenzy of everything's all fucked up and confused, and I don't know what I'm doing.

You know, like I'm kinda standing up for really what I-you know what I mean? Like I don't wanna go with her, I'm just not feeling it, you know. But I feel awful about that. You know, like I just[pause] I even had this crazy idea-I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">think this is possible for me, but I even have this crazy idea like what if-you know, maybe I should be like celibate for a while. I don't think I can, but I'm starting to want-like the last-on top of all this, last night I met up with this chick I used to kinda see, Danielle. And like it just totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">became something sexual. I mean, I knew there'd probably be some flirting or something, but it-you know what I mean. And I was like, \"What, this is-\" Like sometimes I catch myself-not sometimes, every time that happens, like I get caught off guard. Do you know what I mean? Like with Lily the other-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: [unclear] [11:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Well, with Lily the other-this is going to sound so lame. Did you watch a lot of Seinfeld?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Remember that hilarious episode where Kramer has the kavorka.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: With the nun and the church and the Lithuanian, and George wants to convert or whatever. Like I was thinking about this last night on my way home, and I was kinda laughing, but I was also just like, \"What the fuck is happening?\" I don't know what that is. Do you know what I mean? Like I get <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">shocked by-I can't explain it. As the thing is happening, things are unfolding sexually in the situation, I'm caught off guard by that. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Like not expecting it to go down that path, or-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Never being not surprised that I'm able to make this shit happen. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Mm hm, mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: And that's not-I'm not saying it's not good or-it's not good or bad, but there's something about it, I'm starting to feel like, you know what, maybe it's almost compulsive. Because I can't believe that I'm able to make it happen, and I can't stop it. So I'm like, \"Wait. All right, so yeah, we're <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">flirting. Wait, am I going to be able to kiss this girl right here?\" It's like, \"Oh, well, yup. Holy shit, I am.\" It's like almost like a game. Like, \"Will she let me feel her up right at the bar right here? Yup, well.\" Do you know what I'm saying? It's so lame. But because my track record is so successful <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200992\">with that bullshit that I feel like-it's like unnerving. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100058\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: What's especially unnerving is that you still don't know you could go there if you wanted to.

But I do think there's something [unclear]. I mean, there are a lot of attractive dudes, and a lot of them don't have this track-I know a lot of them and they don't have that kinda <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">track record. You know, guys talk, girls talk, whatever. And they don't know half the things, like even a quarter of the shit I've done. And it's not a-I don't know how to explain it, it's not a put down or it's not like I'm somehow special, but there's something about my personality or my character <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A12\">or something that is very whatever in that arena, you know. And that catches me off guard. I think it used to be more like I don't-you know, why me? Like I'm not that attractive. Now it's-there's still a little bit of that. But there's also just like, why is this so easy? Like I don't know. It's almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A13\">like a sociological experi-I don't understand what that is. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

And it's just like, wow, what is happening here. I don't know. I don't know what to-I don't know what I'm saying about that, except that I've been starting to wonder if like there's that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">can't be healthy kind of. Do you know what I mean? Because if I wanted to I could do that-I could line chicks up almost four nights a week, five nights a week and stuff like that could happen. And that's-I'm starting to feel like that-I guess it's fun, and there are no expectations, but-I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A92\">Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Like, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well, even before getting to healthy empathies, it sounds like you're just also just trying to figure out what that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Why?

And yeah, she was drunk. But I've been wasted and I still know what I'm doing, all right. That's my theory about stuff like that. I've been wasted, and even if I do something stupid I know that I'm-like I'm aware that I'm doing it, you know. She was-I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">she was like kinda touching herself and shit. She's like pulling-you know, she has like amazing breasts, she was kinda like-I-like what is that? Do you know what I mean? That's hot. I mean, it's also-but at the same time I was like, what-I'm kinda lost now. Like now that I'm not so much about like why <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B92\">do-like whether I deserve that, or whether I'm attractive or not, now I'm just like I don't understand people. Like I don't understand what's happening anymore. Do you know what I mean? Whatever. I'm probably just thinking too much about it. I mean, my guy friends would just punch me in the face if <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B93\">like-yeah, it's hard. She's like showing her tits in a bar. Or some science geek likes to have sex with you. But you know what I'm saying? Especially because they're all so pretty and they're all so-they're not like sluts, or like haggard-I mean, they're always these pretty, intelligent women. And it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B94\">like-I don't know, I can't explain it. I don't know what I'm saying.

Like last time I took-you know, I gave her a ride home. I didn't like-you know. She told me, she's like, \"You're definitely coming inside.\" I'm like, \"What the fuck?\" You know, whatever, sex. And then I left and I didn't feel bad. I felt pretty good I guess, you know. But I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">\"What just happened?\" So I don't know what I think about these things anymore, that's what I'm trying to say.

I'm sorry, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">it's like, \"Wow, can I get this girl?\" I mean, what guy-I mean, that's kind of a normal-some of it's a normal guy thing. I just happen to be one of those dudes that has a really high success rate. So it almost becomes like aDo you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Like a compulsion mark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I told you I hooked up my friend at a bar last Friday. Did I tell you about that? I took my friend Jurgen, who's getting-you know the bar, that new place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: It's a really good place, by the way. I took my friend Jurgen there, the one who's got the divorce, and the wife's a lesbian, all the-you know, the guy is just, you know. So I was like, \"You know what, let's go there.\" So we went there, we walked up to the bar, pretty crowded. I hadn't even <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">ordered the drinks yet and three chicks, one of them looked over at me, I looked at her, I was like, \"Hey, how's it going,\" then I looked back. And she started talking to me. So basically I worked my magic and I hooked her up with Jurgen. I went to talk with her fat friend, and she-you know, I hooked <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D52\">them up, and then I left. But even that I feel like-I mean, that's awesome. I mean, I'm glad I did that for my friend. But even-like I was immediately like locked in. Do you know what I mean?

It was just like, \"Hey what's up,\" you know.

Last night I wasn't faking anything with Danielle, I'm being myself, you know. But part of myself is that part, that if a girl-you know, if there's gonna be-then I just go for it, you know. [20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: But you're also saying in way that you could not do that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. So what I'm saying is I would have to be like-I would have to go to the bar-like last night I got there like five minutes-I would have to have been, \"Okay, I'm not gonna-not flirt with her. I'm not-\" Because I know what my moves-like I-they're very natural, I'm not faking anything. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E51\">I know how I am when I'm-you know. So like, \"Okay, I'm not gonna touch her, I'm not gonna sit too close to her.\" Or-I don't know, something. I would have to like really give myself a talk. Because otherwise it's impossible, it's impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: It would feel like giving her something to talk to not being by yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah.

You're going to just have a friendly time, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And that's not [unclear].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. Even though that-I don't know if that-like, was that the goal last night? I don't think it was. Do you know what I mean? I mean, she's hot, she's nice. It was also like I wanted to-because things kind of ended-I think she thought I was kind of a jerk, and you know. So I just wanted to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED1\">just be like, \"Hey, I hope you're doing well.\" You know. I didn't think-especially her, because she's very reserved, and you know. [pause] McNallys. I was there Monday night by myself because I was gonna go to a show, just for like-it was a nice night out. I want to-I felt like one drink at McNallys. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED2\">I'm sitting by myself, this really pretty kind of modelish kind of bratty girl sits next to me. I'm just like ignoring her. Starts talking to me. And she was like, \"Do you come here often.\" She's like, \"Hey, do you come here often? What's going on?\" We started talking, she gave me her number. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED3\">the dude that she was gonna meet showed up, and I was like, \"Hey, how's it going,\" whatever, and I just forgot about it. And she texted me yesterday. And it wasn't like anything weird, like, you know. It was like, \"Hey, it was really cool meeting you, thanks for being a cool guy,\" whatever. I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED4\">know, whatever it said. I was like, all right.

I don't know. I just don't know. I don't understand anymore. So I think what I'm saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F51\">though is that part of like-that's why I feel like I need to like hibernate and really think about what is going on here.

In some ways that's why I like Maryany, because that's weird with her. Because we're friends, but we're flirty. You know, I don't know. It's not that I like-I don't know, but it's different with her. Maybe because she kinda does <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D1\">what you-not what you do, but she's studying all these psyche, you know. She's gonna be a fucking counselor or whatever.

Yeah, it's triggering a lot of-I just feel really, really anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">THERAPIST: Wow, [unclear].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: Sleeping with someone else, I mean, I would think it could be sort of treating for these feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah, there is that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: So now that's also a piece of what you might-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah, there is that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: [unclear] It's like the rush of erotic feeling or pleasure takes you away from loneliness, anxiety. [30:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: What else would be there if you weren't-didn't have the story of last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: Right, right. [pause] So yeah. I think like today I really-I mean, we're supposed to go to this thing tomorrow, you know, and I just-I gotta suck it up today to do something. [pause] It just sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: It really doesn't sound like you want to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: I'm sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: It really does not sound like you want to go.

Because I feel-I mean, how awful that like, yeah, I really, really like her. I'm really good on-like I like hanging out with her so much, you know. So it just-I don't know. That's the problem. That's why I'm unable to-otherwise I would have taken care of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201611\">it already. I just feel like it just really, really, really sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">THERAPIST: It's a really hard choice to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: Then again, you don't know until you've gotten over-yeah. I mean, it could be that she handles it with a lot of maturity. Who knows? But I just feel really guilty and awful, just kinda-I hate having to make a decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: So you associate-your associations go back to your words about her feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Less than your own feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2016A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2100058\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Am I making the wrong choice, am I being to rash?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">THERAPIST: [unclear]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like maybe I should just suck it up and just go to Maine, and it's just one night, you know, whatever. But I feel like, but that's not the way you should go somewhere. I mean, like, what is it, a chore? That doesn't seem right either, you know. [32:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">THERAPIST: I also wonder if you're identifying with her.
