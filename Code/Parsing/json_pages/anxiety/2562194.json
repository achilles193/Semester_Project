I was like yeah, it\u2019s true. I was kind of like sorry, but you don\u2019t need (inaudible at 00:00:25) and stenographers. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">You have ears, too. Wikipedia was kind of interesting and Wikipedia edit wars and library studying. Those were interesting, but I was just like this is not really about digital. Yeah, this is about digital media or digital technology; and I was just feeling really frustrated.  I talked to someone the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">next day. Also, it was a focus on the stuff that was as an undergrad, which was interviews, [trust-grabbing] (ph?) interviews. I got a recorder and I recorded people and then transcribed it or I could have gotten a video camera, but I never did. So to have her talk about digital video as this revolutionary <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">thing, I was like no, because portable recording equipment is a revolution that already happened a while ago. I was very frustrated. You had said that it sounded like I was picking at her story, making it more ludicrous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I wondered about that. I thought it might be, but I really didn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So I talked to one of my co-workers who had been there the next day. I did eventually leave early. Most of her talk was chit-chatting with friends about how I was frustrated and stressed and didn\u2019t want to be there. One of my co-workers, the part that she said \u201coh, yeah. I really liked it.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">And the part that she liked was the non-digital, like how she taught it. And I was like oh. I talked to her a little bit about what I found frustrating. Basically my colleague, Marvin, was like, \u201cNo, the (inaudible at 00:02:49) part I don\u2019t think was relevant.\u201d How they did it, which I thought if the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">talk was about pedagogy, then that part is relevant.  That\u2019s totally true. If the talk is about the required sophomoric tutorial, and so if they\u2019re trying to find new ways to teach it, to an extent, it doesn\u2019t really matter what they did, I guess. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not actually new, it\u2019s new <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">to the students, so that makes it new, if that makes sense. Then we were also talking about how it seemed a bit ridiculous to make such an honors-only concentration, and so if you\u2019re an honors-only student at Cambridge, you should kind of suck up a foreign class, because (inaudible at 00:03:59) is boring <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">and also it\u2019s like . It just makes you want to be like, \u201cWell, back in my day I had to read Finnish poetic epics. So there.\u201d (both laugh) But that\u2019s not fair. I think what was going on was more about I want to talk about how out of all the departments in which you invite someone you might get a person <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">of color. (inaudible at 00:04:54) will be one of them; and we didn\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">The post doc who came is someone who . . . It\u2019s weird. Certain grad students end up getting picked a lot. Some libraries will kind of talk to them a lot and use them a lot in focus groups and surveys and bring them in. One grad student, I\u2019ve seen her speak four times. I saw her in other focus groups, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">and it\u2019s kind of weird. It\u2019s really skewing \u2013 whatever. I\u2019m assuming Manchester (inaudible at 00:05:42) are canceled and they were [manifest] (ph?). Also the other thing that I found super frustrating was that she didn\u2019t really talk about race at all which is weird, considering the topic. So she is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">teaching the students in the tutorial are mostly black, half black. So she\u2019s teaching them how to talk to black people but she\u2019s like we have to explain to them how to interview people. I\u2019m thinking this sounds very strange. What\u2019s happening? One woman could write up the interview on someone who was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">Ethiopian. There were two or three interviews with people who had come from Ethiopia because of war and were in the U.S.  One was a priest and one was not. That they fled due to war was kind of (inaudible at 00:07:13). It was mentioned, but then Wikipedia said war was actually over conflicts between <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">the Ethiopian Christian sects. (inaudible at 00:07:33), which, I think, is also behind [science in the military complex.] (ph?) But what she was describing made it seem more like people disagree how to phrase this. I think what they are saying is that if you\u2019re sending this kid up to Manchester, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200135\">kind of weird, in a certain way, why are they speaking to recent immigrants as opposed to Manchester natives?  Why is it that the students couldn\u2019t figure out how to get to Manchester on their own? Obviously they can. It is literally possible, but why had they never gone there for a professor? I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200136\">started thinking about those aspects and she just didn\u2019t mention them. I was thinking there must be some kind of tension that she would have, talking to the mature students or the informants and it just didn\u2019t come up. It just wasn\u2019t present. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20012-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562194\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">THERAPIST: That nobody else was seeing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">CLIENT: Then she had this other thing where plotting something on a Google Map and she mentioned how a lot of businesses in wherever they were in Manchester, weren\u2019t already on Google Maps or whatever. Yes, because they\u2019re in Manchester because Google Map is often populated by people who aren\u2019t in Manchester. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">(inaudible at 00:09:27) I feel like there is all this stuff that could be stuff missing and I felt like if I mentioned that, it was also like \u201coh, you\u2019re just being oversensitive and crazy.\u201d I also was super confident and had said to Karl, \u201cKarl, do you notice how all the speakers are white?\u201d he would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200172\">be very defensive.  I didn\u2019t feel like there was anyone who would feel probably the same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: Completely shut down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Shut down and also made me feel like what kind of crazy question was I asking? It\u2019s as if I\u2019m saying \u201cwhy didn\u2019t more of the speakers have blue eyes?\u201d What relevancy is this? I think the reason that I was focusing on every little thing was because this feels safer to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re not necessarily overly sensitive or crazy in whatever way for bringing those up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. And no one will say \u201cit\u2019s because you\u2019re black that you brought it up.\u201d Then there was a related thing that came up at the American Library Association (inaudible at 00:11:31) discussion, which I was following online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: It sounds like, as I think about it, more (inaudible at 00:11:43) colleague, you\u2019re clear that what really infuriated you with the kind of stuff that you\u2019re describing now, knowing that you were only going to be judged and criticized for bringing up things that were really bothering you and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">that likely nobody else was seeing.  And that seems like the much more relevant issue than what I had been wondering about last time about are you being overly critical when she really pissed you off. It\u2019s more that what is more central is how marginalized and [vulnerable] (ph?) you were to being criticized <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">for things that you had strong reactions to. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562194\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">CLIENT: The other thing I was thinking about was I felt very confident that no one in the room would act at all, and now later, when I was thinking about it, I was like well, let\u2019s say that all my reference librarians were in there or some larger chunk of people that I know or work with, because half <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">of them were people that I didn\u2019t really know. I thought even more infuriatingly, I was sad that some people would come up to me afterwards and say, \u201cOh, yeah. I totally agree with you, but I didn\u2019t say anything because \u2013 whatever.\u201d  And\/or one of the organizers would come up to me to want to be reassured <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">that they weren\u2019t racist, both of which are (inaudible at 00:14:43). At this American Library Association thing there was a discussion about libraries and gender. One of the panelists was a black American woman living in Canada, a white butch lesbian from Stanford and some other people.  One of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200233\">things ostensibly this black woman had said was, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell stories in this panel. We\u2019re not going to chat about discrimination,\u201d right at the beginning. There was this immediate push-back, mostly from white people and people who were lesbians or were in that . . . \u201cStory telling is really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200234\">important and it feels like you don\u2019t really want to talk about it . . .\u201d  The response was, \u201cIt really sucks to do that.\u201d Someone talked about how it\u2019s basically terrifying. Either you\u2019re up on the podium and everyone is staring at you and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I have to disagree with someone else on this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200235\">panel,\u201d and basically telling the story of discrimination. A) You have no idea if anyone is going to back you up. B) People are going to argue with you about what actually happened. They are going to argue with you about (inaudible at 00:16:51), if it\u2019s coming, so you\u2019re bringing up this really profound experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the initial response already does not bode well; to your point that it\u2019s a very vulnerable, terrible experience that you\u2019re sharing with people, without knowing if anybody will back you up and just as likely that people will, in fact, blame you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: I have to say it\u2019s a certainty that someone will roll their eyes at me or just be like oh . . . It shouldn\u2019t be necessary. There are studies in statistics and numbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s what it\u2019s out there to do. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re holding personal and awful stuff. It\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s not the same, but like with a panel of people discussing pregnancy, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect somebody up there to tell their awful miscarriage story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: Or even discuss pregnancy in detail. We agree, labor can be painful. It\u2019s like if this panel of pregnancy, everyone should agree on certain topics. Labor is uncomfortable. Pregnancy is a potential health risk or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562194\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see. It\u2019s not incumbent on the people on the panel to say, \u201cLabor is painful. Let me tell you what happened during my labor with my kid so that I can illustrate that and you will have a story to think about how labor is painful.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">CLIENT: And then someone will say, \u201cWas it really?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">THERAPIST: Did it really hurt that much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">CLIENT: Or \u201cmy mom\u2019s aunt said labor is painless.\u201d So presume everyone in the room is onboard with the basic topic and the other thing is I feel like you\u2019re reaching out and making yourself vulnerable and also this loss of dignity almost, like why do I have to this and you don\u2019t? Like why do your facts <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200331\">just exist as facts and mine don\u2019t? I used to tell the stories and then I stopped because I realized it was just so ambiguous, really painful and horrible.  And also why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re talking now about you you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, me me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: And what setting did you tell? Like when you were on pills?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: I guess sort of like to people in life, in the panels, in discussion forums. [This happened before, like oh,] (ph?) there is no racism or racism doesn\u2019t exist once you\u2019re in the Ivy League or if you\u2019re in Manchester or whatever. I used to tell stories about my life to be illustrative. They would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">always be challenged. Always, always, always.  At one point I had this moment where I realized it doesn\u2019t matter how horrible and how clear whatever I\u2019m saying is, someone is going to disagree. It actually was kind of a revelation. One person, it\u2019s this author who has been flogging me online since . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: This is that guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">CLIENT: Part of why he has been doing that was he literally refuses to believe that, for instance, taxis won\u2019t stop for black people in Philadelphia. He insists it has nothing to do with race. It didn\u2019t happen, even if it did have something to do with race. And see? I\u2019m rich because I\u2019m taking a cab <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">in Philadelphia mostly.  So I had this moment of \u2013 huh, there is nothing. The reason why he\u2019s mad is I said that about people and just basically laid that out very clearly using his own words, and he got really mad about it. That is sort of what we did. Besides, I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you a personal <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F2\">story in order for you to do the right thing, do you know what I mean? Especially if we already agree there is a problem and we all want to do the right thing. So what the fuck?  I feel like it makes experiences of racism or sexism about me, this nice person, interacting with this horrible mean person <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F3\">and that mean person just doesn\u2019t understand or is stupid and if this person was educated, the experience wouldn\u2019t happen, as opposed to you could fire Will right now and there would still be sexism and racism in the library system. It\u2019s not about a person; it\u2019s kind of like this huge structural problem <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F4\">as opposed to an individual one-on-one problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: Or, if I follow, like one or a few bad character traits that a few people have, a small number of people. What I mean is, as opposed to being a quite widespread social problem. You do have people that are really mean. Okay, there aren\u2019t that many people who are really mean statistically. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">But that\u2019s not like this. This is racist.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562194\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">CLIENT: Racism exists. People get engaged in racist actions and not (inaudible at 00:24:38) and that\u2019s something that basically a person of color is like \u201cyes, I know that.\u201d People are racist (inaudible at 00:24:50) in relation to white people. What\u2019s the plan? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">THERAPIST: Not everybody says things like the audience in that talk pushing back. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all sort of assholes as people, but it does mean they are sort of acting in a racist fashion to push back on the speaker who said no, we\u2019re not telling personal stories. Is that . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">CLIENT: It is. Yes, that\u2019s basically it. Then something which I\u2019m still kind of stressed about, which is I had been very ambivalent about talking about library issues under my real name or the most common online handle I use because I\u2019m worried about my personal life, professional and crossover. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">worried about crazy stalking dudes. I\u2019m just very uncomfortable with it. I\u2019ve been kind of struggling around how to deal with this and a blogger that I read and admire wrote this long-ass blog post in defense of storytelling, like \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why don\u2019t people just want to tell their stories?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200472\">At the end she was like, \u201cIt seems like all these people who have been involved in proactivism longer than me agree that story telling is a bad idea, but I don\u2019t understand. I love it.\u201d She was like \u201cit\u2019s really important.\u201d And I wrote a really long comment, which was like, \u201cWhy do you need this?  Who <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200473\">is story telling important to?\u201d Cris, this white butch lesbian on the panel, has a lot of experience in (inaudible at 00:27:19). She might want to vent to lesbians or computer people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">THERAPIST: What does butch mean? Mistaken for . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes, she is a butch lesbian; she is defined as a woman who looks masculine and people will identify her as a man. The people that she might want to vent and tell stories with is not that audience. I said \u201cWhy is it important to you?\u201d and I said everything that I just said. It was small.  I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">posted it and went home. I was like whatever. Who cares. Then I get home and I\u2019m looking on my phone and was seeing Doris and Pat were like, \u201cOh, my God. This comment is amazing. I want you to read it.\u201d Retweets galore. I was just like oh, shit. This was not what I meant to do. I did not think that through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So you made that under your own name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">CLIENT: Actually what I did was I ended up using my library handle\/my personal handle. I was in a rush.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: Okay. But now you\u2019re out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: I was just like well, that sucked. I immediately e-mailed the blogger and asked if they could just make that one name? What I ended up deciding was can you just make it not my personal handle, because that\u2019s the one that is associated with activism? It will make a lot more sense coming from <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">that person. But also, I was just like I guess I did that. (inaudible at 00:29:59) It\u2019s really scary. You end up saying things. You know people are going to respond in a variety of ways, all of them not positive.  Everyone is staring at you. I have now publicly said no, nice white ladies, you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200532\">have story telling. When I got home I just had a stomach ache and it was horrible, horrible. That was really stressful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562194\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t expect you made the decision to do that. If you had waited and said yeah, it\u2019s worth being out there on this. I\u2019ll sign it this way. You just kind of did it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. And part of it was I felt and still feel like I didn\u2019t say anything particularly that would blow up. I didn\u2019t feel like I had said anything particularly amazing. I was sort of long-form saying what I had been saying in short-form and pulled in a Melissa Harris-Perry quote or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">like that. It wasn\u2019t original to me or original, I was just like I don\u2019t know; it was just part of why I couldn\u2019t make a decision about it because I didn\u2019t feel like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it was going to go anywhere really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: And then it did and it\u2019s still going. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Did you get in quick enough so that when people re-publicized it they did it under the alias that you wanted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes, I did. And then the blogger was like I want to repost your whole comment as a separate post. I was like okay. That\u2019s when I also started completely flipping out. If you\u2019re going to publish it as a whole post . . . She was like \u201cMy blog isn\u2019t that well-read.\u201d Oh, my God. Yes it is. It doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">really matter. It was sort of like so this has happened and . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">THERAPIST: What are you worried about? Are you worried about push back? Are you worried about being identified and associated personally with this?  People making negative comments?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: I\u2019m worried about being . . . All of this is perception; perception, reputation, and (inaudible at 00:33:23). I\u2019m worried that people are going to be like, \u201cOh, yeah. Karen. She\u2019s bad. Angry black person. You can never make her happy. She\u2019s just angry and black everywhere.\u201d And not be taken <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200631\">seriously because \u201cshe\u2019s just always complaining.\u201d Also people being like \u201cI don\u2019t want to work with her. She\u2019s so angry about all of the race things.\u201d  There is that aspect. There is this aspect of I also do not feel capable of being a librarian discussing racial issues. That\u2019s not what I want to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200632\">and I don\u2019t feel qualified for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: You mean not having a preference to do it or part of it is also you dread doing something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">CLIENT: It\u2019s also just super frustrating, which is also part of the problem with academia.  Let\u2019s say I got a professor job. Yay. There is the expectation that I would supervise the Black Student\u2019s Organization or the Gay-Lesbian Student Organization or whatever. Gays have additional \u2013 I won\u2019t say burdens, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">but jobs bundled into existing roles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: And people rarely explicitly say anything; and then what you roll into the job is \u201cokay, you\u2019re doing this.\u201d I don\u2019t want that.  I don\u2019t want to worry that if I\u2019m blogging or tweeting about (inaudible at 00:36:38) feminism or a friend of mine who is trans-gender or making terrible jokes, there <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">are a lot of things that I will blog about and talk about that I wouldn\u2019t do at work.  Now everybody gets to see it, which I just am conflicted about and also conflicted about things getting pulled out of context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You, in most contexts, don\u2019t like that at all. You hate being that visible, particularly when it comes to this kind of stuff. That results in bad and hurtful reactions from people.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562194\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">CLIENT: I had this odd experience of when someone set up (inaudible at 00:37:59) and the speaker, who I had never met, was like, \u201cOh, yeah. I had met you maybe. Don\u2019t you have this well-known Twitter . . ?\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cshit\u201d because, again, not really thinking about it, I had tweeted under my own <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">Twitter account, a whole bunch of Harvard library [murder] (ph?) stuff, not really thinking about it. In my head it was like who is going to remember the information or the source? Like it doesn\u2019t matter who is saying it. She remembered it two years later.  I said something else and then I think I made <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F2\">a crack about how I didn\u2019t think that it was going to be so popular and also something about online harassment or something. A worker and this person were both like \u201cwomen are harassed online?\u201d They were surprised. A) Yes. B) This has really never come up? A part of me also feels that it\u2019s a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F3\">weird to have people I have worked with not know about things I spend a lot of time on.  There are things I would like to talk to co-workers about, except I don\u2019t want to go through the part that sucks where they disagree with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: We should stop. Are you okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just really, really stiff today. I wasn\u2019t stiff before this semester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">THERAPIST: Be careful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
