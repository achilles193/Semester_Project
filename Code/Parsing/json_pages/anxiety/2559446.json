I don't really feel I don't want to bother him, you know. (laughs) But I just feel like bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Feel like bad, like not wanting to bother him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like he has so much to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: And I'm adding to the confusion. (laughs) I feel very unsure, like very unsteady with respect to like being in his life. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It's a very weird feeling. (pause) I was just asking him the other day like, \"How do you place yourself with your colleagues?\" Like, so just to get a sense of how worried he is about his career. Or like how other people think about comparing themselves and all that. So like he has a good objective <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">perspective that he's not published as much as his other colleagues, but he does more (inaudible at 00:02:26) work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And like but then there are people he knows that work constantly. They're always on you know, gchat (ph) . They are always working. They are always putting out papers. And he's, you know, telling me about them. And I kind of feel guilty for Like I wonder if I keep him from doing that. Like if I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">leave him then he would work like those people and like, you know, if that is what he wants then he would be able to achieve more. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I feel very nervous about it. But he says, \"You know, it's nice.\" You know like he wants to do a lot of other things and not just work all the time. He wants to engage in politics and he wants to not just produce academic papers, but like (sniffs) write for other mediums. And he wants to spend time with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">But all of that makes me feel very nervous. You know? Like I don't, I'm not sure or I don't know if I deserve it and yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Deserve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Like him to be around so much. (laughs) It's weird. Like, you know, when he wasn't around I would be, like a couple of years ago, I would complain about it and feel, you know, hold on to that angst or whatever and feel very comfortable in a weird way that, yeah, he doesn't have time to spend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">with me. You know? And then just getting used to that. And now that he has time to spend with me I feel very nervous. (laughs, pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Nervous about having his attention?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. Too much pressure. I'm not sure if I wanted to Like I just feel very weird and anxious about it. Like, you know, that I'm keeping him from working. That he should work instead of spending time with me because he will succeed if he works. And, you know, I don't know. (laughs, long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">I guess I feel nervous a lot. (laughs) I don't know why. (pause, sigh, long pause) I suppose I wonder if it has to do with not feeling like I'm his equal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Maybe I would feel nervous even if I did feel I was his equal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You do sound like you feel like an underling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) I don't know. It's just weird. I feel weird a lot about a lot of things. (laughs, pause) I just want to dig a hole and crawl inside and not come out for a very long time. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559446\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: What would you be hiding from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Everyone. (laughs) Mirrors and your reflections and not know what people think about me and stuff. (pause) Like last night there was a protest for something and I was there. And like this was something I felt very strongly about, emotional about. And they pointed the camera at me and I spoke <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">a little bit and then they put that video online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">And I saw it this morning and I'm like cringing and I scream every time I think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">Because I look so awkward and like so nervous and I just look like a mess. (laughs) Whereas other people are so poised and they speak so well. They articulate themselves so well. You know, very normal, very adult, very calm. And I'm just like, I'm so awkward. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: And I think about it and I just scream every time I think about it. (pause, sigh) I mean I like going to such things like, you know, and I feel it's important too. And there is all this negative stuff in the media and it's important to lend your voice to say something positive and instead however <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">few words or however small your gathering, it does reach people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">So it's not that I want to stop doing it. I just wish I wouldn't feel so awkward after having done it. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: And it's not so bad. Like some other girl heard what I was saying and she gave me her business card. She was like, \"Girl, let's meet up. Let's hang out.\" So it's not that people Maybe they see that I am a bit awkward and shy, but it doesn't prevent them from wanting to know more. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: And that's a positive. But I just get so overwhelmed by thinking about myself like that that I just can't function for several minutes. (laughs, pause) I don't know why there's this acute sense of whatever it is. (laughs) I don't know what it is. (pause) I just want to be confident and bold <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">and I don't think I'm naturally like that. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I mean even just thinking just for a bit about last weekend when I was telling you about crashing that gentlemen's [tea] (ph) or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: You know, in those scenarios where I'm sitting with a bunch of say men, you know, who are intellectuals, it's like I'm just telling myself, if I get something out of it, great. I should sit there and just kind of, you know, swallow the thing about them not letting me speak or listening to me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">or looking at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">I should just swallow that because if I'm learning something and if that's important to me. But I shouldn't keep thinking, \"Oh I should just leave.\" And, you know, \"I'm intruding,\" and this and that. (laughs) I waste a lot of energy thinking negatively. It's become such a pattern. (laughs, pause) I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">don't know. (pause) I just think my temperament is really shy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (sigh) I just wonder if it's something like I cannot change. (sigh) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: I guess I'm struck by the question, because I would think that you were a better judge of your temperament that I would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">(phone ringing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Well, I might not be able to be objective. That's all.

(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: How would I assess what your temperament is? How would I assess that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I don't know. Like a few weeks ago I asked you if you think my temperament is, you know, sad. You know, I have a tendency to be sad and depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Depressed not sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:51)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. And you said you didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: That's true. I had a stronger feeling of that, about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause, sigh) I don't know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: The main part of the point is that these moments, and there are many of these moments, that you look outside yourself for self definition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Hm. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Well by asking me to tell you whether you're a shy person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I feel like that's something that you know from the inside out, not the outside in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Hm. (pause) Why do I ask these questions?

I feel very unsure about myself, I suppose. (laughs) It's not a good feeling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: You want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. (sniffs, pause) I don't know. (sigh) I guess public speaking is not my forte maybe. It's a skill that I haven't acquired. (laughs) I guess I could think of it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well it's not clear if it's that or if it's confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Hm. Well you require confidence for public speaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: There's confidence in public speaking, but I don't think all public speaking is simply confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Like I think it has other skills attached to it too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. How do I become confident? (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: By stop being so unconfident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: And how do I do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: (laughs, pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well there's something that makes you anxious and inhibited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And you began today by talking about the couples therapist and not wanting to bother Chris (ph) . And feeling like he has important things to do. And I almost feel like it's like a kid who feels like their Dad's at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: \"I don't want to call my Dad.

I just want to shake that feeling with Chris (ph) . And it's like I want to feel that way about him because that's how I see him. And not seeing him like that would be a fundamental change in our relationship and in just the way see him. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: I mean maybe I'd be more confident bothering someone who was not so important. (laughs) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yes. I think that's absolutely true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Or maybe you could see them as so important, but yourself as equally important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: I don't know if I would feel equal to anyone in this world. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That's quite a statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: I know. (pause) Especially right now. I just feel really very, very nervous. (laughs, pause) It's just I'm nervous in my own skin. So I want to hop out of it and have at someone else's. (laughs) Or nothing. You know? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559446\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Do you think you've felt especially nervous the last few days?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean (sigh) Yeah. It's just I wonder if [that something to do was] (ph), I have a deadline tomorrow for class, my class. And I have to submit something and I just didn't know what to submit. And then all of a sudden yesterday or two days ago, the deadline, I'm like, \"Oh, I'll submit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D11\">chapter one,\" which is, you know, the hardest thing to finish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">It's in shambles. And now I have just one day to work on it. And I don't know what. But it's, I mean, just like being nervous that I'll lose my chance with the professor. You know? Because he's supposedly a very good teacher. And I just don't want to lose my chance. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">So I'm just nervous about that. Like actually very, very nervous getting started and yeah. Thinking consciously about working instead of subconsciously, which is a lot easier for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: And then with this protest and looking, watching myself on the video. (laughs) And then there's Chris (ph) . And like last night also, like he wanted to listen to this classical Nepalese singer. He's very good. And Chris (ph) and I both like him a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">Unfortunately, (laughs) when I was seeing Victor (ph), he's also a lot more into classical music, Western more than Nepalese. So he played me that song and like I guess used it to seduce me. (laughs) So that I have very, very strong associations with that singer and yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">So for the longest time I couldn't listen to the singer at all. But then, thankfully, I was able to. That's who I listen to most of the time when I work. And I've been able to dissociate because I guess I'm not consciously listening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">But then last night like right before we went to bed, Chris (ph) was listening to it and I just started crying. (laughs) And like he felt very upset and kind of didn't talk to me and went off to sleep. And he said he felt very powerless and this and that. And I told him, you know, \"I try not to cry <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">in front of you too much.\" And he's like, \"That's very noble of you.\" (laughs) And I don't know if he was being sarcastic or not, but I took it as that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">So it's like I feel like, you know, I've done this thing where I've made a mess of things. And we shouldn't have gotten back together in the first place because for most couples this would be a very big thing. You know, they wouldn't get back together after such a thing. So, you know, I just feel responsible <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">for Chris's (ph) feeling powerless or feeling bad. It's like, \"What a waste.\" You know, he could be thinking about work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: But, yeah, I just feel like a fool. (laughs) I feel that way for a long time, but like when I've actually been foolish then it's even more, like it confirms my fears. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And how have you been foolish in this case?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Well just getting seduced by him, you know, by Victor (ph) .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: (sigh) Willingly. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Is Chris (ph) foolish to be with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: Well like I feel like, subconsciously I feel like Victor (ph) duped us both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: You and Chris?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I do feel (laughs) there's a tiny bit of solidarity here. For, you know, there's two fools together. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Mm. Then Victor (ph) is the powerful one in that situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559446\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. He's had no losses. He's just the way that he used to be and he's moved in. And he was in Greece and hosting (inaudible at 00:25:38). (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Didn't Chris (ph) have a girlfriend who also cheated on him with one of his friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: No, it wasn't cheating. Like, it was Victor (ph) . (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: It was Victor (ph) again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: He just liked her and she was at a very weird stage in her life. She was experimenting apparently. And so she made out with him because he liked her a lot, but she didn't like him back. But anyway, so they made out and then like a few weeks later or something she made out with Victor (ph) . <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201011\">But she liked him for like a few days or something. And so Chris (ph) was upset about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: It wasn't the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Exactly the same, but it was like it was the same thing in that, you know, triangle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: And it was Victor (ph) and Chris (ph) . (laughs) I knew about her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I guess one of the reasons it came to my mind is that it seems like Chris (ph) has his own issues with triangles. Even the triangle with you, him and your mother. I mean it's a different kind of triangle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: But he seems very drawn to these triangles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: And I guess I'm saying that only because, I'm not here to psychoanalyze Chris (ph) .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: But I guess I'm saying it because it's very hard for you to see that, and I've said this before, that people have their own motivation and interests in what they do. And they allow themselves to be influenced. I mean they embroil themselves in the situation. They are not simply victims.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: Hm. So what do you mean by that in this scenario?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Well when you were saying that you and Chris (ph) are both sort of the victims of Victor's (ph) .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: You know, you were the fools of Victor's (ph) shenanigans or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: Machinations. I guess I'm just, and the thing that we keep coming back to and back to, is does one person hold the power and the other person helpless? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah. So you mean to say Chris (ph) is not a victim in this situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean to say that Chris (ph) that has his own complicated motivations for doing what he does and getting himself drawn into situations the way he gets drawn into them. And making the choices he does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">CLIENT: Hm. So you mean he shouldn't have, perhaps not, trusted Victor (ph) after that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">THERAPIST: I guess. I mean we could sort of I hadn't really thought about practically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">THERAPIST: I mean it was a crappy thing for Victor (ph) to have done in terms of him supposedly being Chris's (ph) friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: So, yeah, I guess I feel like for you there's a blurred line between people treating people badly and having sort of so much power over them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: Hm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Like it's not to excuse Victor's (ph) behavior, or like Chris (ph) wanted it. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">THERAPIST: I mean I'm not (inaudible at 00:28:38) suggesting that. But it's sort of this way that Victor (ph) has power, but Chris (ph) has made choices in his life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah. But he's chosen to be with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">CLIENT: He could've said, \"Absolutely no. I can never get over that.\" But he didn't. I think, I think what happened was he didn't think things through. He didn't. And that can be wonderfully powerful. It makes him feel powerful. You know? If he were to sit down and like picture us together, obviously <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201451\">he would, you know, completely fall apart and never even think of getting back together. But he doesn't do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20144-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20144-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559446\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">And he also doesn't, didn't at the time, was saying, \"Let's get back together.\" Not even saying, just falling into that pattern, realize that there will be moments when I will think of Victor (ph) even as Chris (ph) is around and cry and, you know, all this. But he'll have to go through it and feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201471\">powerless. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">Yeah, I just have that pattern of thinking. I just fall, slip right into it that, you know, when someone has wronged me they And, you know, stupid internet, you can follow them. And like, \"Oh they're doing just fine.\" You know? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: You know, and they seem to be the victors and I seem to be the loser.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: What have they won and what have you lost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: What have they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">THERAPIST: If you're a victor, you're a victor of something right? So I'm wondering, what have they won and what have you lost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: Well I know I lost hours and hours and hours of thinking and worse. I developed patterns of negative thinking because of that. So I'm in, you know, a quagmire of, yeah, like a spider web. (laughs) And they have won as in that they are moving ahead. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">And, you know, I guess all of us fear that we didn't produce meaning or we didn't change someone. We weren't as special to someone as they were to us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: Or they don't think about us and they've forgotten us. (laughs) All those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">THERAPIST: So being a loser is having another person have more significance to you than you have to them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: That's an interesting definition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: (laughs) Well to me that's what's important, I guess. Or at least when you are playing this game of love or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">THERAPIST: Here's the thing that I've got stuck in my head right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">CLIENT: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">THERAPIST: Along the lines of what we were talking about in people feeling victims and people having power. And I was thinking well certainly the one grouping of people who are easy victims are children. Children can be very easy victims. I mean they are powerless. They cannot be self sufficient the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201691\">way adults can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">THERAPIST: And so I think of children that way. But then I started thinking about the culture you come from and then US culture. And certainly the idea of autonomy and freedom is like the essence of US culture. That you are free to do whatever you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">THERAPIST: Which I think that's true and not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">THERAPIST: All cultures exercise influence, social influence. But I was thinking more about, you know, Nepalese culture. Certainly like when your mother was growing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">THERAPIST: And the pressure and lack of power that, you know, for example, a woman has of who she would marry at a young age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">THERAPIST: That it's not I mean there are certainly limits on autonomy here, but for the most part (laughs) you can say, \"I'm not going to do that.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20181\">THERAPIST: But there is much less autonomy and much greater influence by others on your behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559446\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: And so I just then started thinking about, well I guess then you could see those adults can be victims in that way. I mean certainly adults can be victims of genocide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: And, you know, governments, oppression. So it's not like I don't think adults can be victims. I mean certainly they can. But I just started thinking about that more and I wanted to share that with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's true. It's true that she was kind of a victim in that sense. Truly. It's not like anything in her mind that she was a victim. She really was in that sense. And now living here we're supposed to not think that way. You know? We're supposed to feel free. And for the most part <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B1\">we are. But I guess it's not, that it is the psychological hang ups of not being free previously in our lives, like half our lives, in my Mom's case, most of her life, that are strong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">And maybe that's also why I have hang ups. Not feeling like an adult, not wanting to be an adult. Because like a child can be victimized very easily so my childlike behavior also speaks to my feeling like a victim. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: You're aware of the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I just didn't know if we had more time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yeah, we still have almost fifteen minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: Yeah I don't know if maybe that's why I feel like a child, like actively or maybe not so actively, but just slip into that pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: I guess that's what I find most embarrassing about myself. That, you know, awkward, silly and childlike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: But you don't always experience yourself that way. You've described at times you feel arrogant, but times when you're very sort of vocal and forceful in your opinions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Even in public arenas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's true. Yeah. But I guess when I'm feeling small I slip into that image of myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT: As a child who can't really do it. (laughs) Or can't protect herself. (pause) And that's when I guess I need the most kind of assurance. And that's when, you know, the nervousness kicks in and I ask you, \"Am I this? Am I that? Why, why, why?\" I cannot Like the machinery up here just shuts down. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">I can't think for myself with any amount of confidence in anything that happens up here. (laughs) I just feel it very intensely so I just wish I could reduce the intensity of it. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: The other thing that's going through my mind, which I imagine is related on some level. We never, I don't think, fully talked about, is whether you were interested Well we did talk about it financially and logistically, but whether you would continue to be interested in trying to add another session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's just right now I don't know if I could do it financially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: That's the main concern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe a little later. I'm working toward it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">THERAPIST: I think there is, and it came to my mind too, is I thought some of the issue I don't want to incentivize you moving in with Chris (ph) for financial savings, but I guess I thought about it too because I thought that it would be more financially feasible living with Chris (ph) . But I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B11\">be wrong about that. I mean, you could need your money for other things too. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559446\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, like I have moved in and the other people have found a place finally, or someone found a place for them. (laughs) After, you know, three months of my not living there and paying rent. But, you know, my Mom is kind of not in a good place at all. Like she, I have to pay her whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B31\">rent and all that. (laughs) And I only as a student make enough to pay her rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">THERAPIST: When did you start paying her rent again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">CLIENT: It's been like a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) Because she was getting unemployment and then she, you know, obviously she's not going to get it for any more than they allow. Which [is only right.] But now she's studying for exams and hoping that she'll get a job. But I certainly don't want a job right now. (laughs) After a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB1\">long time I'm doing what I should have been doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">And it's not going badly. So (laughs) I mean, that's the other thing. It feels like such a compromise. Obviously, I won't feel very romantic about Chris (ph) . (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry. It feels like a compromise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: Well, you know, living with him because of all these financial constraints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Is that part of the reason that you moved back with him is to pay your Mom's rent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: You never said that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: Well I didn't want to articulate it out loud because then it would be true. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Oh. So when was it? Did your mother start asking you to pay her rent? How did you even know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: Because like she just brought the envelope. (laughs) So, yeah, I mean she can't pay her rent. She has no source of income. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: I thought she taught.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: That was a few years ago. A couple of years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: She can't get on disability?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: She's not disabled, thankfully. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: I don't know about that. She probably could get on disability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: But she hasn't a disability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: She probably could qualify for a mental disability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">CLIENT: I don't know if that will damage her psychologically more. Well she just needs to pass one more exam and then she should be able to get a teaching position. Actually, I take that back. She was teaching, not years ago, this summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">THERAPIST: I thought she was teaching recently, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't know why that slipped my mind. Yeah, because it was only in the summer and they paid her like two thousand dollars for like the whole year or something like that. That's all that she made. It's a good position, good experience, but very, very little money. But hopefully she'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E31\">be able to get something better after she has passed this exam. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">THERAPIST: My head is spinning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">CLIENT: (laughs) I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">THERAPIST: No, you shouldn't have. But it's so interesting that you wouldn't have mentioned this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">CLIENT: Well I wanted for it to be I didn't want that to be true. I live in denial. That's a big part of me. (laughs) I'm surprised that word has never come up. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">CLIENT: But I didn't want to think that I was giving up my place because of my Mom. But I mean I really don't want to say that. Even as I'm saying it I'm telling myself, \"No! It's not true.\" (laughs) But it is. (pause) But why shouldn't I move in with him? He likes me and I like him and, you know. (sniffs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">(phone ringing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Sorry.

Well, aside from the complications of how you feel about Chris (ph), you said that was, at least the timing of it was particular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">THERAPIST: The timing of you moving in with Chris (ph) and your mother needing rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">THERAPIST: So when she hands you an envelope, at that moment how do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">CLIENT: Well, now I feel good about it in the sense that, you know Well not good, but it's something to be done. Like I try not to feel burdened and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20203\">THERAPIST: No, not what are you trying not to feel. (laughs) What do you feel? I mean, \"I try not to feel this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20205\">CLIENT: (laughs) Well neutral, I suppose. Like, you know, it's duty. You know? If it has to be done, it has to be done. You can't really question every single thing that you're doing or you'll be a basket case. Which maybe I already am. (laughs) Yeah, I mean, she needs it more than I do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20207\">THERAPIST: That's an interesting statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20209\">CLIENT: Well, actually, this might surprise you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Okay, let me hear you surprise me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah, yeah. I'm buying my freedom. You know? Like I'm keeping my mother at bay. (laughs) Because it really was very messy living with her. I feel all this positive emotion towards her. You know? Love and all this affection and all that and pride and everything. I want only those to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2020D1\">remain and like the feeling of burden and, you know, all that, I want those to be minimized. And when I pay her rent that's what I'm getting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Well, you do appreciate that buying freedom is an oxymoron? Because if it's freedom it should be free and you don't have to pay for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20211\">CLIENT: No. Freedom comes from the barrel of a gun. So says Mao. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20213\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20215\">CLIENT: So in this case. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">THERAPIST: Are you a Maoist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20219\">CLIENT: (laughs) Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021B\">THERAPIST: Really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, I appreciate, you know, the tenets of socialism. But maybe not how it was carried out in China and the USSR. But anyway, so yeah, that's what I feel like. You know? By giving this check I hereby absolve myself (laughs) of the, you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20221\">CLIENT: duty of living with my Mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20223\">THERAPIST: So you're paying her off. Like a bribe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20225\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Give her her own space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B\">THERAPIST: You're paying her off so she doesn't testify in court as a witness against you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022D\">CLIENT: (laughs) I've done nothing wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Well, not according to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20231\">CLIENT: (laughs) Well (sniffs) I haven't killed anyone, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20233\">THERAPIST: Well there are things you can do wrong aside from killing. Killing isn't the only crime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20235\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm sure of that. Some of them. (sniffs) Spying and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20237\">THERAPIST: No, no, no. I think sometimes you might think your needs could kill your mother. They would trump her needs. That there's a battle between who's needs are more important. And if your needs took precedent she would be homeless and maybe die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20239\">CLIENT: Well, I don't want to think that far. But there already has been that narrative that my needs trumped hers because (sniffs), I mean she's got her narrative that, \"Oh, I'm trying to become a teacher. And it's been, you know, all these years. And, you know, and just as I'm about to get some kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202391\">of licensure in one state. We have to move.\" This has happened like three times. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20238-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20238-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559446\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: When she was with your father?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">CLIENT: No because of me. Like I wanted to go to school in Ohio. And then I wanted to go to school here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">THERAPIST: But why did she have to move with you? I don't understand? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's again, you know, like we could debate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">CLIENT: But at that time it felt like it would be better because (sniff) she had to move from Virginia to Ohio because she just crashed her car and lost her job. And I wasn't living with her that year, so I just felt like, what's the point of, you know again, not having family and her not having a husband. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202451\">It's difficult so you do the best you can. And that was the best I could do to live with her again. (pause, sniffs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">But now I've been able to realize that having my own space or living away from her is important to me or has become important to me. So, you know, it was either getting a part time job and having a place, continuing to live with my roommates and pay my Mom her rent, or I could move in with Chris (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202471\">and not find a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20249\">THERAPIST: Do you think she Does she think you have a lot of money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024D\">THERAPIST: So when she takes that money, do you think she feels guilty or does she feel entitled to your money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024F\">CLIENT: No, I'm pretty sure she feels bad, but I don't know. Until she finds something, some employment, you know? (sniffs) I guess she tries to make it up by cooking for me and (laughs) yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20251\">THERAPIST: I guess what I was asking in that question is, it's not clear whose is whose and who is obligated to what and who is entitled to what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20253\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20255\">THERAPIST: Who owns what. I think that's what I was asking both from your vantage point and then also from hers. Which ultimately is your vantage point of her anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20257\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20259\">THERAPIST: But that's what's so confusing. Like where does obligation end and choice begin? And expectation end and gratitude begin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025B\">CLIENT: Yeah. We try not to ask too many questions in that scenario, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025D\">THERAPIST: You don't because it's hard for you to see her separate. It's hard for you to see the two of you as separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2025F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20261\">THERAPIST: And those lines get blurred because it's hard for you to see you and her as separate people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20263\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I see some merit in not seeing each other as separate. You know? So I do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20265\">THERAPIST: Except there are conflicts of needs. I mean, between any two people, two individuals, there's conflicts of needs. But I think especially between two adults who just might need different things.
