Well, let\u2019s hear it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. I always have my little things I have to say, but before I do the\u2014go into the homework, just one realization that I had about the therapy, the type of therapy, the REBT, and just kind of therapy in general. And there\u2019s one thing that maybe I wanted to clarify and understand a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">better, because I don\u2019t know if maybe there\u2019s something that I am reading into a little bit too much or don\u2019t understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">But I was starting to think \u2013 as I\u2019ve just been thinking about it and just REBT as a whole, as a concept and unconditional self-acceptance and\u2014I enjoy my time learning about REBT, but where it says I don\u2019t need my\u2014I enjoy my time with such-and-such a person but I don\u2019t need them. Or I enjoy but I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">need their approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I was kind of feeling differently, that humans need humans. And the one part that I have a difficult concept with is understanding \u2013 because no one\u2019s ever done that experiment of just sitting in a room completely by themselves. But I think that other people do, in fact, need people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And so I just want to say \u2013 because I was thinking about it \u2013 that I think that just like we need food and water and that to survive, we don\u2019t need other people\u2019s approval. We can survive without approval from others and them saying that they think that we\u2019re the best at something or the greatest and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">they could think that we\u2019re not that great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">But I feel like just that the human condition is that I don\u2019t\u2014unless there\u2019s something different about me, I feel like I personally need to be around people, that that\u2019s a need. That if I was in my apartment all day long, by myself, every day, I don\u2019t know how well I would personally do with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">And so I feel like part of the REBT and why I feel like it\u2019s been successful for me is the relationship. Like, I feel like the relationship is a huge piece that I don\u2019t want to ignore that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Which relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: The relationship between you and me!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: The therapeutic relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: The therapeutic relationship, which would counteract the whole idea of not needing somebody. Because it\u2019s not that I need, but I look forward to and enjoy. And if it wasn\u2019t there, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to know, because it\u2019s based on the relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">And so, my whole thing is I don\u2019t think I need the approval of others. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion. I don\u2019t think that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Do you need my approval?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: I mean, maybe in some ways, yes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You mean, you think you need my approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: A pity. That won\u2019t help you. Something to work on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: No, no, but I\u2019m saying in general\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: I hear you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I think that that\u2019s something that is\u2014it\u2019s like the human condition, that you have to constantly say you can survive without it. But I\u2019m not talking about approval. That wasn\u2019t the part I was talking about. What I\u2019m talking about is needing just humans. Humans needing humans.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">And yes, it\u2019s nice to do alone things and enjoy your own time and unconditionally self-accept your own company and your own time, but I feel like it\u2019s a basic need that is one of the things in there is other human beings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">And I feel firm about that. And I don\u2019t want to let that go. I\u2019m going to persevere that the food and the water is all very much necessary to stay alive \u2013 and human beings, as well. Even though I haven\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re saying you\u2019re firmly going to stick to that, or that you\u2019re firm in expressing it now but you actually want to hear my response?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: No, if you say no\u2014if you respond to me and say no, that you disagree, I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m okay with hearing your opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Would you like to hear why I disagree?!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Sure, sure. I invite it. [giggles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Okay. So what I believe \u2013 and more importantly, what REBT asserts \u2013 and I believe in REBT or I wouldn\u2019t be practicing it with you or anyone else, or on myself in my own life \u2013 is that there are some things which are very healthy. And some things which are definitely life enhancing. And it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">important to desire them, want them, and to do your best to get them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">And one example of that would be the having of healthy relationships with other human beings: to have that, to want it, to strive for it. If \u2013 however \u2013 a person finds they\u2019re in unhealthy relationships and if he or she is not willing or able to work on changing them, or to look for healthier friendships, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">relationships, that is not a good thing. Nonetheless, there\u2019s no disputing that most humans can be \u2013 by nature \u2013 social animals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Social animals, right. That was what I meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Okay. I said \u201cmost,\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">Now, life can be unpredictable. And sometimes, some very extreme and rotten things can happen to some people \u2013 such as losing the significant others in their lives. And if a person strongly believes that without those people \u2013 and others \u2013 that they can\u2019t survive, they can\u2019t live, then the chances are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">greater that they\u2019re going to create severe depression or worse. They may become suicidal and worse \u2013 meaning carrying out the act \u2013 if they think their life is hopeless, worthless, and they can\u2019t go on without others. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">If a person recognizes that their life is enhanced by others and the circumstance, the rotten circumstance \u2013 accident, war, murder \u2013 has deprived them of their loved ones \u2013 illness of their loved ones and then they die \u2013 if the person thinks and is realistic and healthily grieves but refuses to let <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">themselves think that they can never, ever, ever, ever in their life be happy again because they needed those people and only those people in order to be happy, they put themselves in danger of fulfilling that self-defeating prophecy. If they realize \u2013 in a healthy way \u2013 that they will be deprived of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">those ones for the rest of their life, and it is very sad, but that where there\u2019s life, there is hope \u2013 they are more likely to experience healthy emotions, appropriate grief, and still function effectively in their lives. And there is every chance \u2013 if they\u2019re willing to make some effort \u2013 that in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200613\">time, they can meet other friends. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s what I\u2014but that\u2019s\u2014Debbie, that was exactly my point. I wasn\u2019t saying that\u2014I wasn\u2019t talking about loved ones. Of course people lose loved ones and they have to accept\u2014I was just saying human beings need human beings in general. I don\u2019t want to use the word \u201creplace,\u201d but there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">people that if you do lose a loved one that, yes, it\u2019s\u2014you have to grieve and go through that, and that you can meet another one, a loved one that potentially becomes a more permanent loved one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">But what I\u2019m saying is that I think people do need those relationships in order to\u2014in other words, if you\u2019re living in solitary states, I just think that\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know how the REBT works with that. I think that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Perhaps I didn\u2019t express myself clearly. Shall I give the example of me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So in my life, here\u2013 you know I\u2019m from Australia, originally\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: and I moved here. I worked with Al. Our friendship deepened. And after some time, we married. And he was my life and my focus. Our work together was a great focus. And so, I didn\u2019t socialize. I didn\u2019t really have a desire or opportunity to make friends here in NYC. And then years later <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">he died. It has been around six and a half years since his passing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">And soon after Al died in 2007, my mother \u2013 in Australia \u2013 had an accident and there began her slow health decline and she had to go to a nursing home. And I was coming and going from here in NY to there in Australia, spending many months there with her, making sure she was getting the best care and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">attention. I would spend on average 9 months a year during that period 2007 \u2013 2011 in Australia. And then she died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">And after that time, really, there was hardly anyone who checked in on me. And when I say \u201chardly,\u201d for some weeks there was no one. There was no one reaching out, to find out how I was. I was very alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">Now, if I believed that I need humans to survive, I would have been \u2013 in all probability \u2013 weakened and in a very rotten space.  I was grieving, I was in pain. My energy was low and I was appropriately sad. Missing my mother. Missing Al.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">But I kept on going. I kept on going. And it\u2019s taking a long time to make new friends, because I\u2019m not desperate, but it is happening gradually. And it\u2019s not that I believe I need human company. I prefer good company like-minded souls. My work brings people to me in my life. But at that time, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">of all my traveling, there was a cessation of one-to-one work. I was mainly doing writing work and some presentations, which are less personal than one-to-one human contact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">My point being, Jessa, that because I didn\u2019t think, \u201cI need others and now I have no one significant in my life who loves me!\u201d because I didn\u2019t believe that, I probably moved out of an intense grief sooner than I might have if I believed, \u201cI need, I need, I need.\u201d  I didn\u2019t experience anxiety, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">I think I would have experienced if I believed, \u201cI need them and there\u2019s no one close to me!\u201d Yes, I grieved, I felt sad, but those feelings did not debilitate me. I felt them, and kept on living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">Now, by the way, the reason I\u2019m disclosing my experience to you here\u2014and I speak to you as the person I\u2019m working with, my client, and also knowing that you work as a counselor, as your therapist, I am disclosing it in the hope that it is of use to you. I\u2019m not being indulgent, here. I don\u2019t need for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">you to hear my story. I hope this is a useful living example making the point I\u2019m wanting to make \u2013 that is why I am sharing it with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">I didn\u2019t feel anxiety about my aloneness. I felt deep, deep sadness and grief \u2013 which, frankly, was healthy given the circumstances. But I wasn\u2019t debilitated, because I didn\u2019t create those unhealthy emotions of depression and anxiety, because I didn\u2019t succumb to any thinking that, \u201cI need people to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">survive.\u201d I want good people in my life because it makes my life better. That\u2019s a healthy want. But a want is different to a need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">An additional response to you, is that if the goal of life is staying alive, I would agree it\u2019s contingent \u2013 and certainly babies and children usually \u201cneed\u201d others who are providing food and shelter etc to them for them to survive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Okay. Maybe that was\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: We need water. We need food. And preferably a roof over our heads unless we live in Hawaii or Florida. But needing humans? If we are healthy and capable adults No. Is it preferable to have healthy, loving humans in our lives? When I say \u201chealthy,\u201d I mean people who are non-abusive \u2013 I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">psychologically healthy. Yes. Surely a good thing for most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">But if we believe we need it and we don\u2019t have it \u2013 even for a month, even for a day \u2013 we\u2019re less likely to create a healthy emotion if deprived of it. That\u2019s my response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: [laughs] I definitely hear what you\u2019re saying. And I agree with exactly what your point is, only because I feel like we don\u2019t know any different. Well, I don\u2019t want to say \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 most human beings don\u2019t know any different when you\u2019re born and raised in a family, in a home. Because you\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">raised and left alone in \u2013 well, some people are \u2013 but I\u2019m saying\u2014in other words, we\u2019re trained, in a sense. Our minds are trained to need each other, like a baby, like a vulnerable baby that needs to be fed and needs to be bathed. And so maybe that was where my train of thought was kind of going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Right. And by the way, again, what I said refers to adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Adults, adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Children do need adult care to survive. So we\u2019re talking about adults, here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Adults who are not, in any way\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Incapable of taking care of themselves\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: and not\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Who are not disabled and so forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Well, the other reason why I\u2019m feeling maybe slightly more vulnerable is because \u2013 no, not slightly, a lot more vulnerable \u2013 is because I\u2019m going in for surgery next Thursday, for neck surgery. Want to make that clear that it is a bigger procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">I did just have surgery in August for my shoulder. And I did have a couple of people who were here and wonderful and helped me the first couple of days. And then I was completely on my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">I was also sick the year before, diagnosed with an auto-immune disorder. And really was living on my own at the time and taking care of myself. So I do feel that I was able to go to work and handle myself when I came home and be okay. So I\u2019m proof of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">But I\u2019m much more vulnerable right now because I know that the type of surgery that I\u2019m having, I do have to be dependent on other people to (a), take care of my animals and (b), take care of me, because there\u2019s certain things \u2013 going to the bathroom, dressing, bathing I need help with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">And so I think that that point that I\u2019m making right now is probably more poignant in my life, just because I\u2019m thinking I need a plan, I need someone to help me next week, and I don\u2019t like this\u2014I\u2019m going to say this \u201cfeeling,\u201d but I know it\u2019s not a feeling. It\u2019s what I\u2019m telling myself. But it\u2019s also <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">the reality that the doctor said, \u201cYou need somebody to help you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">And so when I felt \u2013 for a few moments \u2013 that maybe that wasn\u2019t going to happen last night, I did start to have anxiety because I thought\u2014I know that there are my best friends and my girlfriend that said that they were going to be here to take care of me. But then they both said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">if I can do this day,\u201d and, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do that day,\u201d and I started to get\u2014to create that panic because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to be sitting here with a brace, feeling completely vulnerable that I needed help either getting up, going to the bathroom. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have this surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: So you allowed yourself to jump into catastrophizing, it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Oh, absolutely, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Okay. Which would have been a good time to ask yourself \u2013 \u201cwhat am I telling myself to make myself so anxious?\u201d\u2014and that process, the ABCDE process, will be easier to do if you continue to practice greater awareness of your thinking and dispute the harmful thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: To do my homework, then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well, if you want to call \u201chomework\u201d, fine, and\/or think of it as the willingness to catch yourself when you are in emotional distress and ask yourself, \u201cHang on, what am I thinking?\u201d Because the reality is, that we create our emotions. However \u2013 let me say now, in your initial question to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">me, you didn\u2019t bring in the aspect of, \u201cIf I have surgery and have a neck brace and am physically restricted and can\u2019t wipe my own ass\u2026\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t. You were talking more generally and my response was to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">Now, you\u2019re having surgery. And the reality is you may be able to survive on your own following that, without help. But it surely would be preferable to receive help. Now, the two people who can do so \u2013 are glad to care for you and your cats \u2013 yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Cats need to be fed. They need to be fed. So, I want to make sure I have someone to do it, that\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Understandably. The two people you mentioned, who are your best friends who you thought would look after you. From what you said it seems that then briefly it looked like they may not. And it sounds like you immediately jumped to the, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have no one!\u201d and so forth, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">Even though they were only mentioning particular times in which they might not be available. Did you catastrophize?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: I did. I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: My hunch is that if you hadn\u2019t immersed yourself in the worst-case scenario in your mind at that time \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019re not here for me, how will I\u2026?\u201d\u2013 you might have been able to pause and think, \u201cOkay, if they can\u2019t, who else can?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I did that. I actually did. And then I said, \u201cI\u2019ll call the city and see if there\u2019s somebody,\u201d because I figured, I live in the city\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Okay, so, stop. So, did you feel less panic, then, when you were looking for solutions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Slightly less. Not as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Okay. So \u201cslight\u201d is better than none, because you jumped from thinking best friends would help to strangers who provide such service may help. Maybe if you thought more about it, without the anxiety, there might have been others who came to mind\u2014you might have thought of your brother or\u2014who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">But anyway, without wanting to spend too much time on this, I believe there were certain thoughts in relation to your issue and circumstance that might have minimized the anxiety. And you\u2019re nodding in agreement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: [giggles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: So, there you go; a good reason to practice REBT even when things are calm. Because if you do that and it becomes habitual, then when you notice catastrophization \u2013 I just made up that word ! \u2013 you will more quickly be able to take yourself out of that state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: [giggles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: By the way, Albert Ellis \u2013 my husband \u2013 came up with the words \u201ccatastrophizing\u201d and \u201cawfulizing.\u201d And what I am about to say may sound like a gossip part of our therapy session\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: [giggles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Late last night, I was watching \u201cLaw &amp; Order\u201d and whatever-her-name-is says to her policeman colleague, \u201cNow, stop catastrophizing,\u201d and I thought, \u201cAh! Albert Ellis on \u2018Law &amp; Order\u2019.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yes ! Now, back to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: [giggles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: So, let\u2019s try and complete this area now, unless there\u2019s urgent stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">Number one, as a capable adult \u2013 and you didn\u2019t mention surgery initially, so, as a capable adult, it will serve you well, Jessa \u2013 I believe \u2013 to remind yourself that, \u201cI love enjoying being with compatible people in my life, and I\u2019ll work to keep those relationships. But if for a day, a month, a year, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">I don\u2019t have them, I may feel deprived\u2014 if I am deprived of them, but I can still find things to be happy about \u2013 or, at least, not sad about. And I can still have a quality life. I can create a meaningful life.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">When you\u2019re having neck surgery and you can only move from the chin up and the belly button down, or whatever\u2019s going to be the case, certainly recuperation is hugely helped by assistance from other humans. But if you don\u2019t think, \u201cI need this particular person to help me,\u201d and think, \u201cI prefer that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">one but if she\/he is not available, I\u2019m resourceful. I can find ways to cope and others who can help me\u201d \u2013 and I bet you can do so \u2013 then you\u2019re less likely to feel panic and anxiety, which you made yourself feel, you just told me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">So that\u2019s my response. Have I answered that adequately?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: [giggles] You were probably such a good child \u2014I see you as being\u2014that you were well behaved. You didn\u2019t do anything. You didn\u2019t act out, necessarily. I just would love to have been a fly on the wall when you were a kid. I would have loved it. [Laughs] Because there is such personality; there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">no way that you put up with\u2014you probably did it in a quiet\u2014anyway, that wasn\u2019t the point of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s not the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: I know, but I work in a school with kids and so I was just reflecting on you as a kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I know, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: At work I was picturing you, because I had shared with my students 50 times \u2013 over and over \u2013 this week that I\u2019m going to be leaving (for the surgery) for a portion of time. So, I\u2019m opening up quite a bit of wounds and they\u2019re all sharing different things with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Wait, wait, wait. You\u2019re opening up wounds?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: For them, for them, for them! Their wounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: How do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: No, but I\u2019ve been using REBT and so they\u2019ve been really good.  Because they start off with things from the past that they would say, \u201cOh\u201d\u2014and I said, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking right now.\u201d And then, within two minutes, we were able to\u2014\u201dwounds\u201d because some of the kids are \u201cwounded,\u201d in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">sense that some of the kids I work with are in crisis mode.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: But not all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Not all. But I\u2019ve been telling them, \u201cThank God for REBT,\u201d because they were all looking at me and one goes, \u201cHow will I survive when you\u2019re gone?\u201d And I said, \u201cI bet you will.\u201d And I said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it.\u201d And then I said, \u201cWhat are you telling yourself?\u201d I did this all day\u2014I\u2019m just tired. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">Literally tired, not\u2014and emotionally drained from just doing it all day long with each kid that came in to say, \u201cOkay. I have something to tell you\u201d and then we talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re emotionally drained. You just may be tired. They are two different states.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Fine. We can beg to differ on that but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: But back to your original question, Jessa. Let us focus, because there are a few things to talk about. So, you heard my response?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: I do not believe it\u2019s particularly helpful for an able adult to think that he or she needs others.  I think it\u2019s really healthy to want others, and to work on having healthy relationships in one\u2019s life. It is preferable, definitely. I am just talking about replacing the need with want, strongly <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">encouraging you to do so. The more you do so \u2013 expecially during calmer times \u2013 the easier it can be to cope healthily in less calm times<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: when sometimes you will not have anyone available!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Again, it might be an hour, a day, a year, a month. Train yourself to think in healthy ways. Let\u2019s look at worst-case scenarios: people in wars\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: who lose everyone. Or a wife or a husband and their partner and children are burned in a house fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: So some people \u2013 hopefully fewer \u2013 will be without very close ones in their life for a time. And they\u2019ll cope better if they don\u2019t think they can\u2019t survive; in other words, they don\u2019t need, need, need\u2014 certainly may want<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: others. But if they accept the grim reality and hold firmly to the hope that in time and with some effort, they can bring into their lives other humans that can be sustaining. Will the new people or other people \u2013 be as close to them as the ones they lost? Maybe. But not necessarily, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201191\">yet they can be satisfying humans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: But interestingly enough, though, Debbie, I feel like when doing REBT \u2013 and if you\u2019re doing it and you\u2019re really diligent about doing it \u2013 I feel like you create\u2014you just create healthy relationships despite that.

That\u2019s the irony, is that you\u2019re saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need,\u201d and then, in turn, you\u2019re getting, in a sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2011A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Because that\u2019s been my experience\u2014 in the sense that I feel like when you don\u2019t have such a high expectation for something, then you just enjoy it even more because it happened, not because you were sitting there and waiting for it to be that way.  So, I feel like, in a sense, that\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">my experience with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: Very good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Is that when things do happen, because I\u2019ve lessened my expectation for people to check \u201cOh, are you okay?\u201d When I do get it, I just enjoy it.

Because I did feel that it would be beneficial and quite necessary for me to have someone; especially not just for myself but to take care of my cats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: So, yes. Beneficial and necessary if your goal is being fed and having your cats fed.

Instead of thinking, \u201cNow, what can I do on those days?\u201d and \u201cAren\u2019t I lucky they can come those other days?\u201d There are stories of people who faint or whatever, they\u2019re stuck in their apartment for a few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">Okay, I\u2019m going to say something now [laughs] because humor is a part of REBT.

No!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">THERAPIST: Do you think that if no one comes to help you for some hours, then your two cats will eat your face?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">CLIENT: [laughs]Unless they\u2019re really hungry because they\u2019re not giving them their daily food that they want [laughs].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Anyway, are you getting my point?

But it\u2019s interesting, because I did share with a teacher, a coworker. She came in and she was really upset. She upset herself the other day. But she said to me, \u201cJessa,\u201d she came in and she said, \u201cMy therapist keeps asking me, \u2018Did something happen when you were young?\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F1\">and she keeps pushing.\u201d Anyway, I said, \u201cI think you would benefit from REBT,\u201d because she reminds me of that type of personality that would just do really well with REBT\u2014so anyway. She goes, \u201cWell, what is that?\u201d So she was in my office and I said, \u201cDo you mind if I multitask? I\u2019m just going to prepare <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F2\">for my leave and get ready and talk to you about what REBT is.\u201d See how I\u2019m pulling other people into it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">So I start telling her. So I said, \u201cWell, let me do an example.\u201d So I gave her\u2014just to make it more, what\u2019s the word\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">THERAPIST: Applicable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">CLIENT: Applicable, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">THERAPIST: Or relevant?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">CLIENT: Relevant, relevant. So I said, \u201cJust give me an example.\u201d So I said, \u201cCan you think of something that today that you\u2014that troubled you in some way? Like a situation that you felt troubled by or whatever it is.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">THERAPIST: That second way, don\u2019t forget to express it when you\u2019re doing it \u2013 even religiously the healthy way of expressing things, not saying \u201cThat made you feel troubled\u201d but \u201cYou created\u2014\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2019A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">CLIENT: No, I knew you were going to say that. But she doesn\u2019t know about REBT at this point, so I hadn\u2019t explained it yet. Then I was explaining it using that purpose. And she\u2019s thinking about it in the sense that she was troubled by something. She\u2019s not thinking in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">THERAPIST: She troubled herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">CLIENT: But she\u2014right, exactly. So when I explained\u2014I gave an example. And I went through the ABC\u2019s of REBT. The A\u2019s. Then I went through C\u2019s, consequences, we talked about that. Then I went through the irrational thoughts that come with it. And then I went through the\u2014the whole thing. So we did the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">So I did that with her and I gave an example. And she said \u2013 these were literally her words \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m too tired to even, like, think. That\u2019s too much thinking.\u201d She said something like that, or, \u201cI can\u2019t even, like, think,\u201d or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">And it was interesting because it actually \u2013 when she said it \u2013 it made me think of you when you said, \u201cWhat evidence do you have that there are people that are so good at REBT and you cannot be that good?\u201d And I walked out not feeling pompous, like, \u201cOh, I kept at it and I\u2019ve continued to do it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Can you put that in context again? Because you\u2019re talking about last session, when you were comparing yourself to others\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">THERAPIST: in your imagination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Because this is being transcribed so I just wanted to be clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">CLIENT: Sure, sure, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">THERAPIST: So, you have shared that in the past you\u2019ve put others on a pedestal and thought you could never do REBT well enough. Or as good as others do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">CLIENT: Exactly. So when she said this to me\u2014and she\u2019s somebody that I look at as a very intelligent, attractive, young, single female with goals and she\u2019s a pusher and she\u2019s on student council and she pushes for good things \u2014and I said, \u201cYou\u2019re tired? Okay.\u201d She was exhausted by that thought. She did <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B51\">not want to unearth any possibilities of anything because she\u2019s not wanting to\u2014and that\u2019s fine; that was her thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">But my point being, that I then realized that I didn\u2019t have evidence that other people just take to REBT and that they do it so well. And no matter how\u2014that if they\u2019re intelligent that they\u2014because this is my little convoluted head really did believe that if you had given it to anybody at my job, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B71\">because they\u2019re all teachers and they\u2019re\u2014that these teachers would take it on they would\u2014and I think to myself, \u201cA lot of teachers speak in REBT language and don\u2019t even realize that they\u2019re doing it, so they would definitely be good at it once they realize more about it.\u201d  This is what I say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">Then when she said that, I said, \u201cOh, well, there you go, Jessa. You were wrong.\u201d And not in a self-damning way but in an encouraging way to myself, that, \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve kept at it.\u201d Because it can sometimes be exhausting when we\u2019re finished with the session; it can. There are definitely <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B91\">times where I\u2019m, like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d But then I see the benefits of getting to understand, and once that concept is understood and once you get or understand what you\u2019re \u2013 in a way \u2013 fighting against but you\u2019re really not fighting, you\u2019re inviting. I look at it as inviting those thoughts to then dispute <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B92\">them. But until you get to the understanding the concepts\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Not inviting, identifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">CLIENT: Oh, identifying.

And I think that when we tell ourselves we need\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D3\">THERAPIST: There can be desperation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D5\">CLIENT: we need \u2013 desperation and all of that \u2013 but I think that there\u2019s something. I can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s something that I can\u2019t actually explain. But I think that there\u2019s just\u2014you don\u2019t have to approve of me or even necessarily talk to me. But it\u2019s almost like a person just being in the room with <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D51\">another person\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Can be helpful. It is helpful for many, depending on who the person is. Helpful, not necessarily necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">CLIENT: Okay. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s wonderful. To be with supportive or kind people. But, again . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DD\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s just my opinion. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t think REBT works in the grand scheme of life, it\u2019s just my\u2014and because it\u2019s never been tested? You used yourself as an example, right? You used yourself, which\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DF\">THERAPIST: I can give a lot of other examples, and REBT is supported by research and such evidence, but we don\u2019t have time to go further into that now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E1\">CLIENT: No, and I thought that that was a great example. But I guess maybe I go to the extreme and I\u2019m picturing just somebody on the earth completely by themselves. That\u2019s maybe what\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yes, you are going to the extreme.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I tend to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E7\">THERAPIST: And if someone \u2013 or, let\u2019s say, there\u2019s a movie now with Sandra Bullock\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, the astronaut \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB\">THERAPIST: called \u201cGravity,\u201d which I haven\u2019t seen. But apparently her cord to her spacecraft is cut or something and she\u2019s floating alone in the universe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201ED\">CLIENT: So, I create anxiety when I think of that, by the way, if I picture that that was me. I personally feel that I don\u2019t know that I would make it, because I would just be out there and I like to talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF\">THERAPIST: And you would be thinking, \u201cI cannot survive without humans.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">THERAPIST: My hunch is that, unless you take some flight to the moon, that isn\u2019t going to happen to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">THERAPIST: My hunch and hope is you will not end up on this planet alone. It\u2019s not very likely. At worst, in all probability, you might be alone some days\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">THERAPIST: in your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve survived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">THERAPIST: Yes. So if you hang onto that thought\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">THERAPIST: instead of thinking of worst-case scenarios and then catastrophizing and then saying to yourself, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it,\u201d then you will feel less panic and anxious. I just brought up a movie and you told me you felt anxious at the just the very thought of the actress, Sandra Bullock, in space.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20200-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20200-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20203\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20205\">THERAPIST: So\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20207\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know.

Okay. I get it, I get it, I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020D\">THERAPIST: All right. So, homework: unconditional self-acceptance. What did you do? Or not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">CLIENT: [laughs] What\u2019s that mean?: \u201cOr not?\u201d Did you have to add that in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">THERAPIST: No, I didn\u2019t have to. I chose to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">CLIENT: [laughs] Well, if it helps any, I have a picture that was brought to me from Arizona from\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20215\">THERAPIST: Hang on, is this a yes or a no? What is the answer to my question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20217\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m telling you what I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20219\">THERAPIST: Oh. Oh, oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B\">CLIENT: Allow me to tell you what I did. There was a picture that was brought to me\u2014because I mentioned this\u2014or maybe I didn\u2019t\u2014about the thing we talked about my doing sessions ago, to get a childhood picture of myself. I think we mentioned it on\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">THERAPIST: You mean a photo?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F\">CLIENT: A photo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20221\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20223\">CLIENT: I said \u201cpicture,\u201d yeah, photo. So, I did get the picture. And it\u2019s sitting up in my apartment here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20225\">THERAPIST: Photo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20227\">CLIENT: Photo. And what I did was I actually \u2013 it\u2019s going to sound quite strange but I feel like if Al were here, he would say that it doesn\u2019t really matter\u2014who cares, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20229\">THERAPIST: Well, he\u2019s not here. He\u2019s a little dead, but I\u2019m here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t. Well, I literally caressed the picture of myself and held it like\u2014and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d and gave myself loving kindness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022D\">THERAPIST: When?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022F\">CLIENT: Last night, last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20231\">THERAPIST: When?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">CLIENT: When last night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">THERAPIST: At what point, what part of last night? What was going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">CLIENT: Oh. Well, it was after I had catastrophized about this whole not having somebody to be here. And then I spoke with \u2013 the Rabbi\u2019s wife \u2013 who I\u2019ve been\u2014I\u2019ve gone to her classes before and we had a consultation because of X, Y, and Z. And so I spoke to her on the phone and we were talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202371\">different, really, just nice thoughts and spiritual thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">And when I got off the phone with her, interestingly enough, my cat was kind enough to jump up on the closet thing where the picture is, where the picture lies.  And during the phone conversation the cat literally pushed\u2014hit the picture down. So, I wouldn\u2019t have even thought to tell her that story unless <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202391\">my cat hadn\u2019t done that action. So, when that happened, then it reminded me that the picture was up there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">So, I shared the story with her. And when I got off the phone, I was just raging with\u2014not \u201craging,\u201d that\u2019s the wrong word. I was just filled \u2013 I don\u2019t know where I got \u201craging\u201d from \u2013 with lots of emotion from our conversation and my earlier catastrophizing. And so I said, \u201cJessa, you\u2019re going to be kind to yourself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">And so by doing that, I literally picked up the picture as if it was a baby. And said I will be kind to me in the way I would treat my students. And I looked at the picture. And then I even did this weird thing that was kind of cool. But I looked at it pretending it wasn\u2019t me, because it doesn\u2019t look <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D1\">like how I look now. And so I looked at it. Really looked. And I actually said, to the picture, \u201cYou are so innocent. You have absolutely no concept of what happened when you were little and you couldn\u2019t have been responsible.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2023C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2023F\">And so I took away some of the guilt and the early self-criticism that I did so much because, unfortunately, that was just the circumstances, that I was constantly criticized. And so I looked at the picture and I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know any different.\u201d And it was me. I was talking to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20241\">So then I did this whole thing where I\u2014by the way, not even thinking that I was doing my homework. I honestly forgot that that was the part of it, because I know you said just be compassionate. And by doing that, I said, \u201cOkay, well, then I don\u2019t have to do any written work and that\u2019s being compassionate <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202411\">enough.\u201d And just maybe, on a very subconscious level, picked up the picture and really just cradled myself, in a sense. And said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d and, \u201cStop thinking the worst,\u201d and, \u201cDon\u2019t constantly beat yourself up because it\u2019s not so bad and things are going to work out.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20243\">THERAPIST: And then how did you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20245\">CLIENT: I felt much better. It was calmer afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20247\">THERAPIST: See? See?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20249\">CLIENT: And interestingly enough, I had a student today who came in and was like, \u201cI hate myself. I\u2019m the worst.\u201d I never saw that much of the kid in the past and still he came in and he said, \u201cI\u2019m so bad and I hate my life and I don\u2019t mean anything to anybody and I\u2019m a loser and I\u2019m stupid,\u201d he kept <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202491\">going on and on. And because I did this exercise with myself last night, it was much more available to me that having compassion for yourself is so crucial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024B\">And so when I was speaking with this young boy today, I specifically said to him, \u201cYou are not having any self-compassion.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd you are worthwhile, just being you\u201d. And it was easier to do with him, for me, because he is a child. So I like to say to children \u2013 as I mentioned one other time <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2024B1\">before \u2013 that, \u201cYou\u2019re only nine years old. What did you do to get this beating?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024D\">And so, we went over it. And he looked out the window. And he actually, in those few minutes, perked up.  I mean, he went on and on for\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024F\">THERAPIST: I want to hear more about you, though Jessa. But fantastic that you helped him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20251\">CLIENT: Well, I used it, and so, that was the homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20253\">THERAPIST: Fantastic. Well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20255\">CLIENT: What do you want to hear more about? I mean, I basically slept with myself last night. [laughs] No, I\u2019m just kidding. [laughs] No, but I was\u2014I put music on, I talked to the picture. I think I got a lot of benefit out of that picture. So, now I get why you wanted me to have the picture and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202551\">watching a video of me was not sufficient, of just watching myself run around. Because that\u2019s not the same thing, you\u2019re not a still. And so, you\u2019re not talking to a video, you\u2019re looking at a photo. And that was, I think, the benefit that I got from having some power-that-be get that photo to me, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202552\">I really didn\u2019t do anything to get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20257\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20259\">CLIENT: Anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025B\">THERAPIST: Good. All right. Did you do anything else in the last few days towards that unconditional self-acceptance, in addition? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025D\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, I did. Today there was the\u2014the principal had sent me an e-mail that said that there wasn\u2019t going to be, now, somebody that was covering for while I was out, which I\u2019d been working so, so, so hard to get that for the other students, so that they have a replacement <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2025D1\">for me when I am away, a replacement in place. And she said that there wasn\u2019t necessarily going to be anybody there. And my go-to, my tendency is to not fight something like that and to just react that I must have done something wrong because I didn\u2019t prepare enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N2025C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2025F\">And instead, I marched downstairs and \u2013 after the end of the school day \u2013 and she said, \u201cYou got my e-mail, right?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d And I said, \u201cAnd it is not right.\u201d I was not catastrophizing in the least. I said, \u201cThese children need to have somebody here,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause it is important <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2025F1\">that the work that I do, that they get that.\u201d  I said, \u201cWould you leave students without a teacher\u2014if a teacher wasn\u2019t here, in the building, because they were leaving on maternity leave or sick, would you leave a classroom without a teacher?\u201d I said, \u201cThat is the same thing that\u2019s happening by them <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2025F2\">not getting a replacement for me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20261\">And my principal, who\u2019s a very tough personality turned to me and she went, \u201cI agree.\u201d And I said, \u201cSo, I will make phone calls from my hospital bed if I have to, to ensure that there is somebody in this building, taking care of the children.\u201d And I stamped my foot and I think she probably didn\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202611\">what do with me because that\u2019s not my\u2014my tendency is\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20263\">THERAPIST: You mean it hasn\u2019t been your tendency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20265\">CLIENT: Well, it hasn\u2019t been my tendency, yeah. So, I think it was a surprise\u2014she turned around and was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20267\">But the reason that that relates to unconditional self-acceptance is that I wasn\u2019t blaming myself that that crap happened. In fact, I said, \u201cThose people are lazy.\u201d And I did say something that probably was not nice but I didn\u2019t say anything about anybody in particular, I just said what I said\u2014and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202671\">went, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d  And I said, \u201cWell, somebody needs to get their butt over here and start helping the kids. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to have to make phone calls and do something about it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20269\">And I felt that I was feeling life isn\u2019t horrible; this is just a really crappy situation. And I didn\u2019t catastrophize it and make it into a huge thing. But I just said, \u201cThis really sucks right now, because now it\u2019s left on my hands that I have to have the responsibility when, in all actuality, somebody <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202691\">else really could be doing this right now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2026B\">So, without catastrophizing about it and, of course, feeling that it was a problem \u2013 because there are problems that do come up throughout the day, and that\u2019s life \u2013 I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out and it\u2019s the not the worst-case scenario. And if the kids do go without a guidance for a couple of <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2026B1\">weeks? Okay. They\u2019ll write me letters, I\u2019ll write to them, and we\u2019ll figure it out. And they will survive.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2026D\">THERAPIST: And after thinking those very healthy thoughts, what was your feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2026F\">CLIENT: Empowered. And more secure within myself, not as questioning of things.  Because I unearthed the real issue. If I had kept that to myself when I saw her e-mail that said we might not\u2014I could have used that as the opportunity to then go, \u201cOh, Jessa, you didn\u2019t do enough. Why are you taking this <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2026F1\">leave?

This is just an unfortunate situation: that I do have an ailment that I need to take care of.\u201d I could sit there and beat the crap out of myself over the fact that I have an ailment. Well, how is that going to help me heal? It\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20275\">THERAPIST: So, Well done Jessa. Wonderful. I urge you to use the vigor that you just expressed, that you used to do what you did, to continue to keep yourself calm, to address a situation, and prevent any disabling emotions such as guilt or shame or fear of not having approval of those people, as you <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202751\">voiced your opinion.  Well done!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20277\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20279\">THERAPIST: So, that same vigor expressed with the woman at work you can apply to yourself in the situation you mentioned at the start of our session, \u201cWell, if my preferred people can\u2019t help me, I can get on the phone from my hospital and help myself.\u201d So, you were better at doing it in the school <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202791\">situation than you were on yourself last night. But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2027B\">CLIENT: Well, I did say I would reach out to someone in the city. I just got nervous about finances because I thought they were going to cost a fortune. But I did say, \u201cThere must be somebody in the city,\u201d because I did look up to go on disability and there are lots of options. So\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2027D\">THERAPIST: Indeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2027F\">CLIENT: I was just emotional reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20281\">THERAPIST: Indeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20283\">CLIENT: At that point. And so once you get to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20285\">THERAPIST: You created the emotions that you experienced at that point. And some of them were constricting. And yet, I didn\u2019t get any sense that you felt those emotions when you were at the school, sticking up for the children, the other kids.  \u201cThe other kids\u201d meaning the vulnerable part of Jessa\u2019s kid side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20287\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20289\">THERAPIST: So, you are doing extremely well. Simply giving you the objective feedback that your tendency, up to this point, has been to be more efficient using REBT for the school kids than for yourself in a situation where you feel understandably vulnerable because you will physically be vulnerable <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202891\">after surgery, for a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2028B\">CLIENT: Temporary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2028D\">THERAPIST: Temporary, absolutely. Well \u2013 rephrase. I don\u2019t want to say \u201cabsolutely,\u201d but in all probability. [chuckles] Huge. The point is, Jessa, painting a picture that, number one, magnificent progress you are making. So, great progress. You looked at the photo last night. You addressed that. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2028D1\">it took the cat knocking the photo over! Never mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2028F\">CLIENT: Right, right. Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20291\">THERAPIST: Whereas, at school, you jumped into action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20293\">CLIENT: That hasn\u2019t been my tendency, so that was just today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20295\">THERAPIST: Correct, correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20297\">CLIENT: So . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20299\">THERAPIST: So, you\u2019re doing very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2029B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to jump into action with myself, too, if I\u2019m jumping into action in that circumstance with them, there\u2019s now reason that I can\u2019t do it with myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2029D\">THERAPIST: Correct. And you did it with yourself. But it was a little slower. The cat helped ! Just pointing that out. The REBT is fairly new to you. You\u2019re doing very, very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2029F\">CLIENT: [laughs] I\u2019m just laughing about something else. I was picturing the monkey on the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A1\">THERAPIST: Okay, we can come back to that later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A5\">THERAPIST: By the way, humor is healing, is it not? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, and you can laugh about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N202A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202A9\">THERAPIST: Yes. You probably won\u2019t get locked away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202AB\">CLIENT: No! I\u2019ve done it before\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202AD\">THERAPIST: If you\u2019re sitting alone, giggling to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202AF\">CLIENT: you\u2019ve done that, right? Like when you\u2019re sitting on a bus or something and you have a thought in your mind and then you just start cracking up because it\u2014something happened and\u2014anyway, I just\u2014I\u2019ve done that before!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202B1\">THERAPIST: So, I\u2019m very glad that you like the image of seeing the monkey! if your friends can\u2019t look after you and the city can\u2019t provide a visiting nurse, you can call the Zoo and say, \u201cWhich little chimpie is available?\u201d It\u2019s good that you\u2019ve got this humorous perspective. It helps, does it not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202B3\">CLIENT: It does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202B5\">THERAPIST: Very good. So, when we first\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202B7\">CLIENT: Oh, one little thought. One just little, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny thought. I know that we\u2014I\u2019ve expressed how much physical pain I\u2019ve been in and it\u2019s really, really (inaudible at 00:50:58) so I want to give myself a compliment because I think that\u2014I know this work is so much harder when <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202B71\">you\u2019re in chronic, physical, effing pain every minute. Literally, I know that it\u2019s got to be harder. There\u2019s no question about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202B9\">And so, because I\u2019m challenged with that every day, and so I feel like I\u2019ve\u2014I want to give myself a compliment in the sense that not only have I been able to apply a lot of the practices throughout my daily life but I\u2019ve been able to do it with being in this enormous amount of physical pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202BB\">So, my point is that I can\u2019t wait and I look forward to having an even better frame of reference without the physical pain. And just being able to think a little bit clearer when I\u2019m not so focused on that \u2013 the thought of that. Because I feel like I have gotten so much stronger, just mentally, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202BB1\">just thinking, \u201cWait a second, you\u2019re at this place and you\u2019re so much stronger mentally but look how crappy you feel physically.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202BD\">And so, just a note to recognize that, that that has been\u2014and I did read a portion, when I first started REBT, that it is harder with people that suffer from chronic pain to do REBT.  So, you can\u2019t hide that from me because I saw it in the book. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202BF\">THERAPIST: Why would I hide it from you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202C1\">CLIENT: No, because I questioned, in the beginning, is this a little harder because\u2014when the pain takes over. And I know you validated that, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202C3\">THERAPIST: Yes. Harder. But harder doesn\u2019t mean too hard. It means you might require greater self-motivation to push yourself to do it. And you have done that. Very often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202C5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202C7\">THERAPIST: And just the fact that you are acknowledging yourself for your effort and progress. I don\u2019t know that I would have heard you do that when we first started the work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202C9\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202CB\">THERAPIST: You were far more apologetic and self-effacing and even more apologetic and said things like \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if I should say this.\u201d And you seem much more at ease at acknowledging the very fine progress that you are making in very difficult circumstances. Your intense physical pain. So, <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202CB1\">well done, yet again Jessa \u2013 Well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202CD\">CLIENT: Thank you, [laughs] Debbie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202CF\">THERAPIST: Yay!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D1\">CLIENT: You\u2019re so funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D3\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re doing very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D5\">CLIENT: [Thank you].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D7\">THERAPIST: Indeed. After the surgery, and don\u2019t forget why you are having it. You\u2019re not doing the surgery because it\u2019s going to make your hair a nicer shade of whatever shade it is. You\u2019re having it to improve your life and physical well-being, and to get rid of the cause of your physical pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N202D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202D9\">THERAPIST: So, you know the outcome . . . will bring great relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202DB\">CLIENT: [sighs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202DD\">THERAPIST: And if you\u2019ve been able to laugh and make progress in your emotional experiences during this time of physical pain, yes, it will in all likelihood be easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202DF\">All right. So, in a few minutes, we\u2019re going to finish up. When we first greeted each other, before sitting down to start the therapy session, you mentioned something to me that perhaps you want to comment on now. And then we\u2019re going to finish this session for tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E1\">A few sessions ago\u2014and I\u2019m not sure, again, whether we recorded it or whether it was part of a conversation prior to or after our session, where you may have offered some chocolate to me and I said, \u201cThank you very much, but no thank you.\u201d  And you said, \u201cWell, what will I do with them?\u201d And I suggested <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202E11\">giving it to a homeless person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E3\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E5\">THERAPIST: You brought up that, \u201cOh, I\u2019d be afraid to give it to a homeless person.\u201d And so, this evening you shared with me that you\u2019d given a book to a homeless person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E9\">THERAPIST: So, that sounds like progress, as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I found this book, and there\u2019s this woman that reads. She\u2019s homeless but she reads every day, outside, by the church. It was something that I noticed, just in passing. I happened to notice that she has a different book in her hand every day and she sits right by the church. And she never <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202EB1\">smiles, from what I\u2019ve seen. She just always has this very hardened\u2014I don\u2019t want to say \u201chomeless looking\u201d look on her face, but it really is \u201cI don\u2019t have a home\u201d look.  It\u2019s just not a revived, refreshed look and I\u2019d never seen her smile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202ED\">And so, when I got a book from work the other day \u2013 because we have a little rack with different books and stuff that we can take \u2013 and I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to be having surgery and I\u2019ll probably have time to read.\u201d And I saw this book called \u201cBossypants\u201d by Tina Fey and I just picked it up. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202ED1\">put it in my bag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202EF\">And interestingly enough, later that afternoon, I walked outside of work \u2013 of school \u2013 and I saw this particular woman was sitting on the stoop. And we (you and I) had discussed that, maybe when the tape is off, we had said that she reads. I maybe said it after and that I felt it would be more valuable <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202EF1\">to give her a book than to give her food, just because it was more thoughtful, I felt. It was more applicable\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202F1\">THERAPIST: More personal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202F3\">CLIENT: It was more personal. So, needless to say, I realized as I saw her that, \u201cWait, I just got this book,\u201d and I wasn\u2019t really attached to it in any way.  I didn\u2019t really feel like I needed to read it, but it looked interesting. And so I literally just took it out of my bag and \u2013 without even really <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202F31\">thinking \u2013 I just handed it to her. And walked right up and handed it to her. And she gave me a huge smile. And then that was it. And I literally was like, \u201cI thought you might want to read this,\u201d and handed it to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202F5\">And of course, now, I look every day to see if she\u2019s reading it. I\u2019m looking, I\u2019m like\u2014because I can see\u2014I\u2019m not staring at her but I can walk by and see the corner and know. And it\u2019s funny, because I was saying to my girlfriend earlier tonight, about the situation and what happened. And she said, \u201cOh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202F51\">good, she\u2019ll be malnourished with good books.\u201d And it was really cute.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P17-N202F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"16\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":18,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"18\" data-page=\"18\">\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202F7\">And I said, \u201cYou know, I keep looking to see if she\u2019s reading it yet.\u201d And my very rational girlfriend said, \u201cMaybe she hasn\u2019t finished her other books yet.\u201d [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202F9\">THERAPIST: Anyway, the point for here is you did something that, in the past, you might have been afraid to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yes, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202FD\">THERAPIST: So, really, what\u2019s been a common theme of our time in this session has been some observation of how far you\u2019ve come in just weeks, in a very few months of applying REBT principles. So, that\u2019s very encouraging. And, again, as you pointed out a few minutes ago, at times, you\u2019ve been applying <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N202FD1\">it under severe difficulty, in terms of your physical pain. So, well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202FF\">I have some suggestions for homework between now and our next session. And then we\u2019ll finish for tonight. Any other comments or questions from you to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20301\">CLIENT: No, uh-uh.  I was going to say something but I forgot. It\u2019s not important. I just talk a lot. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20303\">THERAPIST: All right, so I have some suggestions for homework. Here\u2019s paper and pen for you to write them down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20305\">CLIENT: Oh, it\u2019s actually very, very hard for me to write right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20307\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20309\">CLIENT: If you wouldn\u2019t mind helping me with my arm? I can barely raise it today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2030B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2030D\">CLIENT: So . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2030F\">THERAPIST: No problem at all. So, let me tell you my suggestions. And tell me if they feel do-able to you or not, in all honesty. Because our next session will be our final session for this chapter of therapy. You\u2019ll be off, soon after, for surgery and I\u2019ll be off to India, spreading the REBT gospel <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N2030F1\">of Saint Albert and the wannabe Saint Debbie!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20311\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20313\">THERAPIST: [chuckles] So, the next session will be our final session for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20315\">So, here are my suggestions. Tell me how doable you think they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20317\">The first suggestion is for you to write down \u2013 and by the way, this comes from what we did tonight in our first part of this session \u2013 write down strategies for how you would cope if you are left alone. I don\u2019t mean floating in space and I don\u2019t mean every other human in the world is dead. I mean for <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203171\">a few days, if there\u2019s no one around you here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20319\">CLIENT: Post-surgery, not regular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031B\">THERAPIST: Both. Regular and post-surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031F\">THERAPIST: Strategies for coping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20321\">CLIENT: You\u2019re going to write this down, right? Because otherwise, I\u2019ll forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20323\">THERAPIST: I will write this down for you, mm-hmm. Doable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20325\">CLIENT: Uh-huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20327\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll do it? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20329\">Then, secondly, because it will be our final session for this chapter of our therapy, prepare any questions that you have for me about REBT or you. Any relevant questions. Do-able?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2032B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2032D\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m inviting you to think about it, because we want to use that last session very well. You may have fresh questions at the time, but prepare. Yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2032F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20331\">THERAPIST: Then, thirdly, I invite you to make a note of the gains that you\u2019ve noticed through REBT. Now, a lot of tonight\u2019s session included that. But do it again. And with some thought, you may come up with other changes you have made in recent weeks. And I remind you that the main issue you identified <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203311\">that you wanted to work on \u2013 right at the beginning \u2013 was anxiety. So, fourthly, reflect on how you\u2019ve been in that regard.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P18-N20330-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"17\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20330-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":19,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561806\" data-realpage=\"19\" data-page=\"19\">\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20333\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20335\">THERAPIST: And particularly how you\u2019ve been handling it differently, if you have, than you were handling anxiety prior to REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20337\">I also invite you to note changes that you\u2019ve observed in yourself. Again, some came up tonight, but do it again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20339\">Changes \u2013 this is another part of the homework, fifth part \u2013 to note changes in your impression and knowledge about REBT, because you had some misconceptions about it when we started out. So, let\u2019s hear your now awareness of it. Revelations that came from and after sessions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033B\">And finally, sixth part of homework, come up with your goals and intentions going forward, after our final session next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033D\">So, is there any of that homework you feel is not doable or too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033F\">CLIENT: Not doable or too much . . . no, I don\u2019t think that\u2014I think the only thing that may be a challenge is the writing, just because of what I said I am dealing with in my arm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20341\">THERAPIST: So, will you find a way to overcome that challenge?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20343\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20345\">THERAPIST: I believe you will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20347\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20349\">THERAPIST: All right. Anything else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2034B\">CLIENT: No, I think we\u2019re about done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2034D\">THERAPIST: Well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2034F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20351\">THERAPIST: Well done, well done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20353\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
