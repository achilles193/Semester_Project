It was a very, it was kind of a drug-oriented theme which was fine \u2013 like made me a little uncomfortable. But I find his music to be very erotic. I always have for years and years and there\u2019s something about making love while <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D3\">his music is playing that is like so centering and like makes me feel whole or something. Jeremy really wanted to have sex yesterday and I couldn\u2019t do it while he was sick but then at some point we turned on \u201cFlying Lotus\u201d and then we could.

I was feeling b badly about his reaction through the whole weekend. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">So the dream was about Vassar reunions which was about this pageantry like I don\u2019t know how much I need to go into it but like 80,000 people get to come back every year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Whoa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: There is this long, historic, like some historic traditions it\u2019s very like we are the center of the world kind of thing and there are panel discussions and seminars and a long parade and like the oldest classes have volunteered for one of them for many years. Like the Class of 1928, all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">living members will show up and like (unclear) usually a member of every class present. And then it\u2019s just like this huge shit show at night. Everybody\u2019s wearing like these matching your year Vassar jacket and there\u2019s music and the campus completely changes like they put up all these gorgeous wooden <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">fences and like you can\u2019t get anywhere, like it takes forever to get through them. I had to play music like at three out of the five years and all of the ones when I was a student. As children we grew up going to the fireworks display. Anyway, my brother has more tolerance for that sort of stuff than <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200593\">I do and Jeremy has no tolerance for it. And it\u2019s five days long and one of those days is his birthday. So we\u2019re not going. I probably would have gone by myself if (unclear). So the dream was that reunion and Jeremy was sick like both maybe from an illness and because he had taken some weird drug or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200594\">something. We were like running or falling down this long outdoor stairwell and Jeremy gets to the end of the stairwell and starts like throwing up and my mom comes like running with all these empty Tupperware\u2019s which is like \u2013 is a really like sweet and accurate way of picturing like my mom in one <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200595\">of her elements. It was like she just cooked this huge feast and also she\u2019s been saving like 25 Tupperwares for all the people who are around to take food home. She comes running with these Tupperwares and she is like is horrified to see that Jeremy is this sick and like tripping or something and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200596\">start like spitting as I\u2019m salivating a lot for some reason and also maybe because I have taken the drug. And everything feels unsafe and scary and very sad and bad and somehow we like go into this very small space and this huge black man is like knocks at the door and is like 8 feet tall and his face <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200597\">is like so scary and he enters and then I woke up and had a couple of hours of very invasive, racing thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559851\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Not as much as when I was taking antidepressants. I would say it used to be like once or twice a week, now it\u2019s maybe like once every two weeks. What\u2019s bad about it is when I wake up I can\u2019t close my eyes because I go like right back into the dream and I can\u2019t keep my eyes open because I\u2019m exhausted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">and my brain is like \u2013 there\u2019s like, \u2018this is a thought. My brain produces thoughts. This is another thought.\u2019 So like that muscle is getting stronger and stronger which is really nice. But then the rest of it is like I\u2019m trying to like being and having some stillness through it and every other \u2013 the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">visual aspect of it is so powerful so I can\u2019t like have a blank mind. There\u2019s always like for hours there\u2019s always like scene after scene. Every scene happens to be one that like is scary for me. Last night is like being at the top of the mountain at Yosemite or being in the rain forest in Costa Rica <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D3\">or being in our apartment which is somehow really scary and I was trying to like, there must be something I can visualize that won\u2019t seem scary, and I couldn\u2019t find it. This is the place that wasn\u2019t so scared that I was charged, that didn\u2019t feel very restful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">(Pause): [00:16:55 00:17:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Leaves.

(Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200953\">I mean, I can just tell like how much he doesn\u2019t want to be hurtful because he\u2019s not pursuing this directly. He\u2019s just sort of speaking up when I make some room for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: But he\u2019s not sort of initiating taking it up as an issue of (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: No. No. Like he will be really upset when we start talking about it but I think he\u2019s avoiding it. But anyway, I made it clear that l need this to be workable between the two of us in order to keep going because it\u2019s too much to not have his support on it. He said, \u2018I thought I married an Indian, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">not a [Windian] (ph). Why are you \u2013 like you\u2019re stuck in a computer age world.\u2019 And then I went on and on and on about how meditation is 2500 years old and psychotherapy is quite old and I guess we talked about it more later and I guess what he meant was things that are sort of fashionable right now <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200992\">for people in the country in a way that like maybe neither of us would have predicted that I would be so interested in both practices. So, anyway, like I\u2019m processing too much for him, doing too much (unclear) processing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">(Pause): [00:26:48 00:28:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I guess I sort of figuring out the relations between that \u2013 like how much progress you\u2019re doing and how on one side and what it is in particular that you\u2019re processing and sort of how that effects you and between you and Jeremy. In other words, I guess I feel like there is something that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">getting left out a little bit you know, where the two of you are talking about the form of that the processing is taking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but (Unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah not what\u2019s being processed and how I think that\u2019s pretty central to what\u2019s going on. In other words \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Well, I think this is like how I experience things. I don\u2019t think this is like unique to me feeling experiences. Like whenever there\u2019s every anything going on I feel I sort of chew it over and over again out loud and like worrying about it and he thinks about it and I think about it myself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">we talk about it from many angles. I mean the way a lot of people experience the world and make decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559851\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m smiling because like I think I could get a sense from what I\u2019ve seen of you of what you mean. Like, \u2018okay then, let\u2019s deal with this.\u2019 Like this way and that way and another way and how about this way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m not sure that in here that is what\u2019s central. I think I\u2019m hearing him say, \u2018I need to not hear about this stuff in the way that you like to talk about things.\u2019 So the things I\u2019m processing are like things it\u2019s so frustrating to not know the things I want to know about you.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">(Pause): [00:30:59 00:31:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: That\u2019s something that I feel I need to talk about every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: You talk about that with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: With anyone. But there aren\u2019t that many people I can talk about it with including Jeremy, I guess. So that\u2019s like one category that like is endless for me. There is like isolated realizing different things and things coming up that felt important. I\u2019m noticing my relationship with my mom is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">changing a little bit. Like I talk a little bit about that as a result of our work here, I think. So it\u2019s not just about you. There\u2019s a lot of like (unclear), that sort of stuff \u2013 relationships, dysphoria, feeling unsettled thoughts and feelings. And then with meditation it\u2019s similar it\u2019s I guess about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF2\">practice, what practice is like and (unclear) with different people, what different teachers say. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Is it about what you\u2019re doing, what your experience of practice is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s a little thorn in the meditation talk because then I said that he knows that (unclear) meditation will help him so much but he can\u2019t get (unclear) to it. So we\u2019re not supposed to talk about meditation at all because it\u2019s driving him away from it, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">(Pause): [00:33:21 00:33:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: And other things you have been thinking and talking with him to do with what you learn about me, the things we were talking about the other day, are there other things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: No. Some (inaudible), the things we talk about every day, so there\u2019s a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">(Pause): [00:34:15 00:34:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: When you talk about it is it in a frustrated way or a sad way or a thoughtful way or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Sometimes it comes out as like unbearable sadness, like where I\u2019m trying not to talk about it but then I just can\u2019t contain it anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I would imagine you\u2019re actually working extremely hard to try to contain all of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I am. Sometimes it comes out as thoughtfulness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And I think you\u2019re really overwhelmed and that like comes out wanting to talk to Jeremy or managing how much you do, but you can\u2019t help it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: I mean that\u2019s sort of why this is useful for me because it\u2019s a way that I \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know.
