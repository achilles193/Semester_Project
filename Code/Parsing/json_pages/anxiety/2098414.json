Your cheeks are rosy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I need to knit one of those hats that covers the head, everything except for the eyes, because everything is cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Hopefully there won\u2019t be very many days this bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: So my boyfriend and I finally found a way that we can exercise that, if it\u2019s not this cold out, we can actually stick to. There is this game that\u2019s an augmented reality game, which means that it takes place in the real world.  By adding things virtually, it\u2019s called Ingress. Basically there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">are two portals. There are two teams and either you go to your own portals to get entry or you go to other portals to take them over all over the world. The portals are virtual, like you only see them on the map. They\u2019re not in real life, but they\u2019re places in real life so you have to actually get up <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">and go to those places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: So that makes it a fun way to get . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. And we were like yeah, we can totally do this for an hour every day if it\u2019s not this cold out; but right now it is this cold out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: The prediction is that it will end on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh, good. Taking off my gloves, even for a couple of minutes outside on Tuesday, was the worst idea ever. It wasn\u2019t even that long that I spent doing it and it was like oh, wow. I needed to get back into the car and then I had to sit in the car and wait for the heat to turn into actual heat <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">so my hands didn\u2019t get frostbite. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I did see some warnings that in the next couple of days avoid being outside and make sure you don\u2019t have any skin exposed, especially if you\u2019re vulnerable to that kind of thing. In the next couple of days it makes sense that you\u2019re not going to use that, but not all of winter is this bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Usually it\u2019s just a few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Well I\u2019m glad you were persistent in looking for something that would be motivating and fit in your lifestyle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t really persistence so much as \u2013 I guess Sydney had requested an invite about a month ago because there was a web comment about it. When he got his I was like, \u201cThat looks cool. I should try it.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, well. I guess I can come along with you on your trips until I get mine.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">And then I got mine two days later, so I actually didn\u2019t have to wait a month.  I guess a lot of people, because it was featured in [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:08) and then all the people were like oh, what is this thing, and signed up for it. The first day James spent a few hours walking around the square <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">and stuff just because he wanted to check out lots of things and stuff. It\u2019s really addictive. I guess it\u2019s helping Google figure out better walking directions for things. They can see where you\u2019re walking from Google, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s, even though it\u2019s free, it\u2019s still profitably bound. I don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">mind giving my information about where I\u2019m walking around to Google and helping with their walking directions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s actually you can feel like you\u2019re, for a good cause, getting exercise and having fun. It sounds like a win-win for everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really worried about my job that I started. I think I can do the work. It\u2019s a little bit complex.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098414\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So what are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m working and doing data entry. I\u2019m really primarily doing data entry and there might eventually be other projects to work on, but it\u2019s mostly just entering the data. Basically you get a request or you get a quick form and it has stuff filled out. You have to add different things that around <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">practice and you have to add the doctors to the system, so you have to look up their NPI and stuff. Also there are a few different fields like they have an address for where they practice, where the service was rendered, another for their normal address, and then they might even have a third address <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">in the NPI lookup system. I\u2019ll figure it out eventually.  Apparently, it doesn\u2019t matter too much which address you use, as long as it\u2019s one of the correct ones. There are a bunch of different fields and stuff. It\u2019s just like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It feels like the whole place is a little too quiet and people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">aren\u2019t really talking. I actually brought my sunlamp with me today in my backpack, even though I took the \u201cT\u201d here and I\u2019m taking the \u201cT\u201d out there. I\u2019m hoping it will help. I\u2019m feeling better now than when I woke up this morning. I just felt so bad. I was just like. \u201cI do not want to do this. I do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">not know if I can do this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: When did you start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Okay. So it\u2019s really new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really new. I\u2019ll get used to it. I guess a lot of the social interaction \u2013 I can do things in my field if they\u2019re by myself without any social interaction and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Because you enjoy them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting. So at least I get some mental stimulation there. I can do boring work if I\u2019m surrounded by people. At least they\u2019re talking. Even if they\u2019re not talking to me, talking to each other, then I can easily do mindless things. I when I was working at [Plan on Giving] (ph?) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">there were some things that were kind of mindless, not that this is completely mindless, but I had a bunch of different things to work on instead of this one task. If I were an actual administrative assistant or something like that I\u2019d have a bunch of tasks. This job has opportunities; it could go on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">longer than three months if they like me enough. They have opportunities for internal advancement.  I was just so depressed this morning. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m going to make the three months. Also when I found out about the job on Friday, later Friday I got a call, which I still haven\u2019t responded <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">to yet \u2013 I guess the first three days since I got the call were not business days \u2013 from this other place that I applied to. It was the New Cheshire Whaling Museum. It was only a one-year position, like 15-30 hours a week. It might be paying more because this job is only paying $10 an hour. It\u2019s sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200394\">of in my field. It\u2019s more library stuff and just like a lot of MARCed cataloging. I didn\u2019t lie to them. I told them I had experience doing archive stuff and in library school I did more cataloging, but I\u2019ve never actually done it in real life.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019d get the job anyway unless I\u2019m the only <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200395\">one who applied, the only librarian-y person who ,applied because I don\u2019t know if I can actually do them. I guess I could learn to MARC stuff eventually, but it\u2019s a really annoying system with all these fields and stuff. When I had assignments to do things in MARC for library school I hated them. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200396\">was like, \u201cOh, God, will I be working on MARC all the time?\u201d Then, again, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m already disqualified now because I haven\u2019t called them back yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098414\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well, call them back. See what the real story is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay. Because I made a three-month commitment to this temp position. It\u2019s not like I signed anything, but it is a position that\u2019s supposed to be going on for three months. It\u2019s one thing to leave it early for something permanent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: A year is a lot more than three months, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: And calling back doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re necessarily going, but it gives you information so you\u2019re not making guesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s just hard with the whole like \u2013 how would I schedule an interview if I\u2019m working? My normal hours would be 8:30 to 5:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: You would have to take a day off for personal reasons or take a half day off for personal reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Which is just a little bit hard because I\u2019m already taking two days off in February for going to New York, which I told them about before they even hired me. I\u2019m just afraid that I\u2019ll get in trouble if I end up leaving before the three-month period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s not ideal, but I think it\u2019s understandable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Most people that are using temp agencies are looking for some more permanent work, so I think it\u2019s somewhat understood that if you got an offer in your field then it\u2019s likely you would take it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: But I think it\u2019s one step at a time, you know? Call the people back if you got a call. Find out what it is \u2013 if you have some questions about the position or if they want to do a phone interview or bring you in. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019re actually dealing with here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: If it\u2019s a phone interview it would be a lot easier. I could just schedule my lunch break to be such that I\u2019m taking lunch when the phone interview happens and take the call outside; though outside it\u2019s freezing cold so, hopefully, it would be a day when I have the car and can take the call in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">my car. I don\u2019t know. I guess I could leave a message or call today during my lunch break. Yeah. I don\u2019t want to screw over the place that I am but . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: You also don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity that is more related to your field because that\u2019s your long-term goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: It is. And it\u2019s just a little bit. I guess I didn\u2019t realize how soul-sucking this would be. I might get used to it. And the thing is I could, at least, listen to the radio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You will adjust somewhat. If you do this for three months, you will get to know the people a little bit. You will get more familiar with the information that you\u2019re entering so it becomes less confusing. You\u2019ll adjust to the schedule. These are all things that are really new right now. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">not used to getting up this early on a regular basis anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Last time that I got up this early on a regular basis, I think, was high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s quite a while ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like ten years ago. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s my floor that\u2019s depressing. The rest of the building isn\u2019t depressing \u2013 at least the parts that I\u2019ve been to in the building. They have a really nice cafeteria and open areas in the bottom and stuff, but the area where I work is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">all cubicles and they\u2019re all really high cubicles so you don\u2019t actually see anyone else unless you leave your cubicle. I guess it\u2019s good to know that I could put on the radio, but the radio that the person who was training me yesterday had on was like super-conservative radio with Rush Limbaugh. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200612\">was just like wow. This is kind of infuriating. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098414\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: If you choose something to listen to that you like, it would be a different feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I was just like oh, my God. Get me something liberal right now because . . . yeah. The guy who\u2019s training me seems to be a nice guy, but that was just like wow. The guy who\u2019s training me today is going to be someone different because the guy who was supposed to train me \u2013 he\u2019s the guy who was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">supposed to train me all along, but yesterday he was out sick. (sighs) I just don\u2019t want to take too many days. Today I guess I\u2019ll just stay later. He said I could either take a shorter day or stay later. Originally I was leaning towards taking a shorter day, but maybe I should just stay later instead. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\"> If I go on that phone interview . . . I mean, they wanted to interview me. Do you think it\u2019s that bad? They called me Friday at like 6:00 PM or something, after business hours, so Saturday and Sunday and Monday were all not business days. Tuesday I was running all the errands. Yesterday was my first <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200653\">day of work, so do you think it\u2019s that bad that I\u2019m calling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: I would call back today. The sooner the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Okay. Maybe I already blew my chance, but I guess I don\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t know that so you call today and see what\u2019s up. See whether they want a phone interview or an in-person interview. See what you can do to schedule it, I think, giving yourself the opportunity before you make a decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Also the whole thing is this is also a very important client to the temp agency so I don\u2019t want to make them look bad, but if I get a job in my field . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: But you are your first priority.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Okay. I guess if I left this for another job I\u2019d be okay with my parents, but it\u2019s sort of like if I left this because it\u2019s soul-sucking and I felt really depressed that would be less okay. My parents would be like, \u201cOh, you have to work.\u201d Now I sort of feel stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: So the goal is to work. If you can get a job that\u2019s in your field that\u2019s even better, so let\u2019s see what the opportunity is. It could all work out great. They could want you. They might have a flexible start date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: If I could start in three months because it\u2019s a one-year grant, I think though, so the start date might be . . . Either they got it out early so they\u2019d find someone in time for the grant to start, or maybe the grant doesn\u2019t start right away; or maybe they got the grant but they don\u2019t have that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">much lead time and a lot of things need to be done by a certain time. It\u2019s like you have to show that you\u2019re using the money responsibly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: But you don\u2019t know any of this stuff yet, so these are the things you want to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098414\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like Tufts has that much invested in me yet so far. They made me a badge, but I don\u2019t think the badges are that expensive. Day one of training taught me about half of what I need to know and then today I think I\u2019ll know the rest of what I need to know. Two days spent training someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">I don\u2019t think would be that expensive, so maybe they won\u2019t be super-duper upset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not personal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like how much am I screwing them over if I leave early?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s see if that\u2019s the option. But I think you owe it to yourself. It takes a lot of effort to find something in your field and get the application out and you got a bite, so I think you owe it to yourself to follow through with that and see what the next step is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Would you be saying the same thing if I wasn\u2019t saying that this was soul-sucking and making me depressed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Because the ultimate goal is for you to get a job in your field and the temp work fits a number of needs, but this is not in your field. It\u2019s not where you want to end up permanently so the fact that you have something that is related to your field, you have a potential opportunity to your <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">field, I think that is a step on the path, even if it\u2019s not exactly where you want to end up. It\u2019s not archives, it\u2019s not a permanent position. It\u2019s something on your resume that, if you get it and you take it, it\u2019s something that\u2019s in that direction. I think your ultimate goal is to build yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">a career. That\u2019s very understandable. Of course that\u2019s what you want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the other thing is if it is a year, even if they\u2019re paying $15 an hour or something, if I did the 30 hours a week because it\u2019s 15-30 hours a week, it sounds like that makes the schedule more flexible and it\u2019s like I might be able to make the same amount of money anyway with less \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">not that it would take no effort, but at least I would be doing things that are interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Interesting to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Interesting, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Sounds like a cool place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. I actually went to the museum a lot of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: (coughs) Excuse me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: I guess you\u2019re still getting over the flu? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: I got a sinus infection after I got the flu, so this is from the sinus infection. I\u2019m no longer contagious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay. (chuckles) I used to go there. I have fond memories of the museum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: They have a big \u2013 I think it was pretty to-scale \u2013 model of an old whaling ship that you could go and play on and stuff. It might even be like decades since I\u2019ve been there. I was very little and half of them are hazy memories. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: But you have memories. That\u2019s really cool to have a little bit of connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: I know absolutely nothing about nautical history and whaling. I\u2019m usually careful when I write a cover letter or something not to put anything in there that isn\u2019t true. Anytime I exempt some experience, like when I apply for some position with reference and then it\u2019s like, oh, well, yeah. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">did reference at this job and the one thing is that I actually only did reference once at that job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You highlight what you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: It did and it was really fun. Telling them that that was one of my favorite things that I did at the job isn\u2019t a lie. I\u2019m pretty sure my cover letter said that I have done unique cataloging with archival collections, illustrating how to use MARC in library school. I never actually said I did <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">MARC at an actual archive somewhere. I guess I could even call the guy back right before I head out to the bus. I could do it from the lobby. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098414\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019re certainly welcome to use our waiting room. It\u2019s usually semi-private at this early hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: I just need to get out. The fact that I\u2019m bringing my sunlamp in today . . . I need the sunlamp. At least this job has a flexible schedule. The other thing is once I started doing a few of these things on my own I was getting the hang of it more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I think you will become more comfortable with what you\u2019re doing. Day one can be very overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Part of the thing is that they have this huge backlog, so it\u2019s like you work really, really hard and get the backlog done while I\u2019m there. Then maybe it will be less bad that I\u2019m leaving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well before you worry about how bad it is that you\u2019re leaving, let\u2019s see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well I might be leaving anyways for my sanity if I\u2019m not leaving for something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s see because you don\u2019t know. Once you get the hang of it, once you get into a flow, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to feel like. Day one and two, I\u2019m sure, are different than day seven and eight. Once you get comfortable with what you\u2019re doing, get comfortable with the routine, it might <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">feel different; so I think before you project what it\u2019s going to be like over time, let\u2019s see what it\u2019s really like and let\u2019s also see what the possible opportunity is with the whaling museum before you jump too far ahead in that process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like also a little bit of schlep to get out to Cheshire, but if I only have to work 30 hours a week I can probably time things so I\u2019m not going during rush hour. I guess it\u2019s a reverse-feed anyway, right? Because more people are going . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: More people are going . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: From Cheshire to Rhode Island than the other way. I\u2019m just sort of kicking myself for not calling and leaving a message on Saturday night or Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Well I think the next best thing you can do is to leave a message this morning. That\u2019s what\u2019s available to you now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just so, so focused on getting things done. Also the whole [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:13) thing is that I had to get retested because when they took the blood test the level came out really, really high; not toxic, but mine came out at like 376 and normal is 100-250 or something. We weren\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">sure if it was a fluke or not. Then I had to go back down to 75mg, which is not quite enough. I could take something in between because they have 10mg pills, so I could be at 80 or 85 or 90. I went back last Thursday to get my blood taken and the person who was there first tried in my right hand, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD2\">usually they can get it from my right hand because, you know, they can\u2019t get it from my arm.  I always tell them to just go for my hand. She didn\u2019t get it on the first try and then she did it again and said, \u201cLet me try your left hand,\u201d because you can kind of see the veins in my left hand. It looks <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD3\">like there might be something, but my left hand has even worse circulation than my right hand. I was like, \u201cOkay. If you want to.\u201d She tried it a second time and failed. I just called Dr. Barnes and I was like, \u201cCan I please do something else? I do not want to go back and have them fail again.\u201d It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD4\">all about how it affects the heart, so she was like, \u201cOh, you can go in and get an EKG,\u201d so I did that on Tuesday. I guess maybe by now there would be a result. I got the print-out of the actual EKG scan, but it isn\u2019t translated into . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098414\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Person-speak.

I was feeling sad before. I was feeling better when I started eating stuff. When I got out to the bus and got a little [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:43) now I\u2019m feeling sad again. It\u2019s like \u201cwork is going to be horrible\u201d or something. It\u2019s not like . <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">. . it would be worse . . . it could be so much worse. I could have a micro-managing boss or something like that, who\u2019s always telling you what to do.

Rather than imagining how horrible the day would be, what\u2019s good about having this temp position?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Well, hopefully, if someone doing the same work as me can listen to the radio, I can assume that I can also listen to the radio, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Sounds reasonable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Or at least after I\u2019m done being trained. I can listen to podcasts and I\u2019m not dealing with anyone mean. I brought some chocolates with me and having the sunlamp on will also help. At least it\u2019s something that I have to think about doing and not just automatically type everything in and be so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">completely straightforward that you\u2019re just copying and pasting everything. It does require a little bit of investigation and stuff. I guess those are the up sides. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: I think trying to focus, when you think about it, letting yourself focus on what the up sides are \u2013 you failed to mention a paycheck at the end of the week or at some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, at some point a paycheck. That\u2019s true. It\u2019s not quite enough to live off of. It\u2019s enough to live off of with my part grant because it\u2019s $10 an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">THERAPIST: That gives you a little bit of independence, maybe not complete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t have to feel guilty about buying . . . Now I can finally get a new phone, which I\u2019ve wanted for a while and have had the upgrade ready, but was like I don\u2019t think I can justify this until I get a job.  I can get nice things and also it is a job that is impossible to do from home, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">means I don\u2019t do any work when I\u2019m not there. And I don\u2019t have to feel lazy anymore for coming home and just internetting and stuff. I guess that\u2019s also an up side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Focusing on those might help you not to feel as sad as when you focus on the down sides of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">CLIENT: I guess I just sort of was like, \u201cOh, my God.

I\u2019ve had a few episodes, even one over the weekend or something, that after I\u2019d gone in the offer for the temp position, so it wasn\u2019t even like I was \u2013 you know. Now I\u2019m panicking about the fact that I\u2019m so worthless because I don\u2019t have a job and I\u2019m spending all my parents\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">money. Still I was feeling kind of horrible and wanted to hurt myself. Sydney helped me. It wasn\u2019t triggered by anything. Even Monday, I think it was, I was feeling sad and I didn\u2019t know why.

At first, my boss, who interviewed me, said the entire month of January is casual; and they have casual Friday.
