You know, I think if I had seen you Thursday, also, it would have been easier for this.

That's a guess, not really a-I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: But that somehow, that easier part would be that it would have been easier for you to tell me what was-the things that came up for you about what we would talk about in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's the theory. Whether it's true or not, I don't... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not particularly clear that that would have made very much difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: I guess I wanted to start with a couple of things from my childhood or adolescence that I find embarrassing or shameful but are not particular terrible, I don't think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">Two things came to mind, (inaudible at 00:07:08) why I started the project of, \"What are the things that I don't tell anyone? Why don't I tell those to you?\" I'm not exactly sure, but it seemed natural, after our conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">(inaudible at 00:07:23) reviewing that set of things, these were a couple of the earliest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">My first sexual experience was with my older sister, it was some...mild dry-humping, essentially. I was 12 at the time, so she was 14. It has struck me, in retrospect, a lot like...I have no idea whether it's an urban legend or it's a real thing, but like intimate female friends practicing kissing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200531\"> It's sort of a classic movie scene, (inaudible at 00:08:10), if that makes sense. It was not really like a thing that happened once. It was like, \"Let's do this,\" she suggested, and then it happened and then it...we've never talked about it since. It was a strange (ph) thing (inaudible at 00:08:37), <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200532\">so that's one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">At a similar age, I think I probably was younger but I can't quite recall...I suggested to my younger sister that we have sex, which we then did, but my understanding of sex was that the genitals come in contact with each other.  Then my older sister explained that's not how it works. We rapidly lost interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560840\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">Those are the two stories that I wanted to start with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:09:15), you don't know how old you were then, just somewhat younger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I think I was younger, so I would say I was between 10 and 13, and she's a couple of years younger than I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And the embarrassing part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Well, any sort of sexual contact with siblings is fairly taboo, so I think that's the embarrassing part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">You look a little big legitimately confused or thoughtful, I'm not quite sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: I don't think confused. I'm trying to understand, you know, what-you prefaced it by saying various things, so I wasn't sure what, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Like I said, I'm interested that I told you the stories and then you said, \"Okay.

You're bringing the experience of having it be embarrassing, and my curiosity about that experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Not that there's the unembarrassing [sic] part and then the embarrassing part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: I was taking away the objectivity in that proclamation, and the (inaudible at 00:10:53), you know, with the experience of the embarrassment was (inaudible at 00:10:59).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think I understand better. In thinking about it myself, I...it's not that hard to come terms with. It's just a thing that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: ... [no one's harmed] (ph), it's not particularly unusual, I don't think, in any real regard.

My mother has very strong norms against a wide variety of things, but among them being premarital sex.  That doesn't seem to be the relevant thing, here. Yeah. At least not to me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200991\">maybe it is, but it doesn't ring true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: What did it feel like to tell me that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: I'm still trying to figure that out. Once I got over the anxiety of sitting down and looking at you, it was relatively simple to, you know-it's just words. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">Those two, I picked in part because I've never told them to anyone, so there was a sort of curiosity as to what would happen along with some trust that it wouldn't be a bad thing that would happen. Nothing bad seems to have happened yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560840\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Such a funny kind of statement, but I was thinking, being a scientist in one's personal life is not a bad thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Being a sort of empiricist, you know.  You check something out. You see if it's, you know, you have a hypothesis but you test it, versus just verifying your hypothesis because you want to. It's not a bad thing to live your personal life that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Okay. Thanks! I was certainly thinking that was sort of what I've done, it's sort of...thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">You know, that does get me into some real trouble in my marriage, in the context of I don't know how to rebuild trust there. The loss of trust is just so acute, in some way. I mean, now it's been a long time, so it's not-but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: When you think about (inaudible at 00:18:13) that how to build it or rebuild it, if you think about what you would like to be there, what needs to be there, what kind of trust what is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: I think there are two separate pieces. One, I think, is I need to be able to trust her to take care of herself, which, that one...it's sort of going okay, my confidence in her ability to handle herself and her emotions is increasing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">Another one is... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: ...I don't exactly know how to phrase it, but a trust in...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: ...a guess a trust in her ability and interest in taking care of me? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I feel like she expresses an interest in taking care of me, but either it's not that strong an interest or she doesn't really have the ability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">Last week, she started working again, as a nanny. One of the (inaudible at 00:20:41) stomach flu, which is, you know, pretty horrible. (inaudible at 00:20:49) I don't know exactly how the conversation went, but I essentially said that I would prefer not to get sick, myself. Since I don't have any direct <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C51\">contact with children, that seemed like it might be possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">Like that to happen, so I asked her to figure out what needed to happen, and I suggested maybe she didn't want to get sick, either. That might be preventable for her, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">Eventually, she did end up getting sick, on Saturday. She'd gone as far as to consult the lawyer that she works with but not the gastroenterologist, who probably knew a little more about the stomach flu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">When she got sick, I took care of her. I looked up and it's very likely that it was just a norovirus; it's the category of illness, just like the third link down on Google or something. From health department websites, you're contagious once you start being ill, and then for about three days to two <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB1\">weeks after you get better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">I still don't want to get ill. Just because she's sick does not require me to be. I have not actually been sick, because that was Friday, so we're probably close to in-the-clear now, but it's been a...strain, because I've been less-interested in any sort of physical contact since she's still contagious <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD1\">with the thing that made her debilitatingly [sic] ill for 12 hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">She understands that, but also it looks like it hurts her feelings when I don't want to kiss her. We talked about it; she agreed that it made sense and that she didn't want me to get sick.  Then, when it came to doing the thing that would avoid it...wasn't really near the top of her priority list.

Thinking about certainly not overtly, like you were suggesting this, but how contagious is her despair and her depression? How contagious is it to your, you know, possible future children? That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">where my mind went; it's that issue of contagiousness and her illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Have we talked much about this before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Okay, okay, because I've thought about it some (ph), but I couldn't-it's been long enough since I've thought about it that I couldn't remember whether we talked about it at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I guess it depends on what you're defining as \"this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: [laughs] That's fine. The sort of contagion idea. I definitely thought about my experience in Illinois as being colored by her depression, to a large extent. Certainly, it is, in the sense that I left there, physically, but also...even before I left there, you know, we talked every day and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">had a lot of bad days, and so it's...it's hard to cope with a heavy workload in a relationship with is more one-directional, in terms of support.  Then go back and work hard the next day, and do it again. I think it's...yeah, certainly I think some of that...despair has been contagious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">I guess either you talked before you made the interesting analogy to a shared not particularly bad habit but something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Drug use, recreational versus hardcore drug use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think that analogy holds, in that circumstance, also, right? Before you recognize, \"Oh, that's gone too far,\" it's easy to elevate along with the person, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">You've suggested I have a tendency to despair, also, and I think that's certainly true. I don't think that's related to Tanya, but I think that's a thing that can be activated or amplified by surrounding myself with despair. Yeah, it's interesting that you should pick up on that, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">(inaudible at 00:27:34) my worry about essentially everyone in her family, on both her father and her mother's sides, all of the parents are either alcoholics or depressed. Yeah, I worry about contagion to children. I didn't worry about this much when we got married, because she was doing better or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F11\">she was doing well, she was...seems to be a relatively normal, functioning adult. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">Hear her tell it now, that was never true; and I don't really think that's true, I don't think. I don't think it's possible to trick everyone around you for years on end. Maybe I'm wrong about that, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">I think she was depressed when she was younger and became depressed again, which is actually more concerning for me, because...(inaudible at 00:28:36) she gets completely better again, and then we have children. What's going to be the trigger and what's going to happen if...yeah, what would happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560840\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: What would happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don't know.  It seems fairly clear to me that the part of her...part of her work in therapy has been (inaudible at 00:29:09) her childhood experiences of trauma and their relation to her more-recent traumas, and her childhood experiences all related to her father and mother both being depressed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F91\">and angry. That seems like not a good circumstance to recreate on a new set of children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Do you think about that?

Mostly, these thoughts weren't off-the-cuff, they were sort of there, I just don't...I don't have much...I don't have the answers for them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: Do you still see Dr. Jannis (sp?)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, I would have told you if we had stopped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess the way I worded it was...I guess I worded it that way because it's not something...in talking about your relationship with Tanya, it's not something that you've mentioned where you were mentioning it before, so maybe that's why I worded it [like that] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah. We've sort of have been dealing with it, like a different project you and I have that's now converged back, so we're back to talking about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">My expectation is that it will diverge again, because I don't feel like all of my trust issues relate to Tanya and I don't feel like we're done with them, in a, \"Hooray, they're all solved, because we've talked for a couple of weeks.\" Think that was really your goal, either. It just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: I certainly agree with that, that all of your trust issues don't just relate to Tanya.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: Yes, we talked this week in that (ph) session about actually trust, in some ways, but...I guess Dr. Jannis summarized it in a-we have very different approaches to the world, and we have different styles of approaching the world, Tanya and I do, and that's true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I guess he went on to suggest that the collision of those is a difficult thing in any relationship, particularly in any new marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">I said, \"That's fine and I agree, but I think that there's more going on here than just that. I think that if we were just here because we have a little bit of trouble at the beginning of our marriage, that would be one thing, but a fundamental (ph) part of this is I don't trust Tanya's method anymore. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D1\">It almost got her killed.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">Then, the session was over shortly after that, so we didn't really get far into that. I guess we're talking about that, also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: It's a pretty heavy topic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Were you saying that in a sort of supportive way, as an invitation to talk about it more if I wanted to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: Not explicitly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: It was more of a comment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: It wasn't explicit. I wasn't not inviting you, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: That's fine (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: Did it feel like I was saying, \"Say more about that?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: It wasn't particularly (ph) clear to me what you were saying, other than, \"That's a heavy topic,\" so I was, I guess, inquiring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: Well, the way you phrased it, that it-what you're saying is it's not-I mean, sort of to put it bluntly, one version of what you were saying or one interpretation is, \"Dr. Jannis was minimizing this, that it's not simply like I like chocolate and she likes vanilla, it's that her approach was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201391\">actually destructive.\"  I guess I was commenting on that heaviness.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20138-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20138-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560840\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I think it's probably a little uncharitable to describe his view that way, particularly-not that you were doing it, but I was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">Yeah, that was certainly my experience of his attempt to summarize or give us some positive outlook on the whole situation. I guess it felt like part of his project is to find common ground for us, and find the place where our experience matches that of others, where it's not so bad or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">I think that's mostly a good thing, but sometimes I think that that's not particularly helpful. The analogy to a normal marriage and the difficulties there is not a particularly helpful one, here, for me. I felt like it was important to say that. Maybe I felt like I needed to say that bluntly or something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F1\">[I don't know] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">Because of course, we were talking about this, also, in the context of this norovirus, so that was-talked about that [in sum] (ph), also. Yeah, it's not a very deep example, but I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: What made you think about the time? Is there something you want to bring up, or you're just curious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: I felt this-there's always more to talk about that I don't want to get into. I don't want to go down a path that was going to take forever or something, take longer than we have. I was trying to use how much time we have left as a way of sorting out what...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: I know I've been the one to bring this up several times. Concerned about feeling kind of heavy-handed, and you need to know if that's true. I was wondering if you wanted to try to meet twice a week for a few weeks, and see if it makes a difference or if it's fine just going back to once a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">I don't know. I mean, it was interesting when you said, \"I wondered what would happen if I had come in last week, again.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: I appreciate you offering again, and it's not heavy-handed.  It's okay. I guess I'm reluctant for three reasons, all of which are sort of interesting for one reason or another, so I'll try to get through all of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">One of them is, is it's a sort of loose fear about time commitment, that...particularly, that if we-let's just say we met twice a week and it was good. I don't know that that's going to be sustainable when I start a new job. That's a thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">Another one related to the time commitment is I...we've talked some about Tanya having an emotional affair before.  It's difficult for me, in some ways, and complicated, that I would rather talk with you than talk with Tanya. I'm mostly okay with it, but it's-that's a complicated thing, so I guess I'm...that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B1\">is related to the time piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Well, that's something we should talk about, regardless of whether you come once or twice a week. That's an important thing (inaudible at 00:41:30), but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: Like I said, I thought most of them were interesting in one way or another. Now I've lost count, whether that was three or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: That was two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, I'm not sure if that was two or if it was still part of one.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20162-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20162-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560840\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah, I can't-I think that was related to (inaudible at 00:42:01).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">The other one is so, we talked some last year about insurance and all of that. I just pay you directly, the insurance doesn't cover anything so it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: That's a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is. I feel like it's been worth it, and...switching to any other insurance system because Tanya has a different insurance that does cover most of or some percent of the sessions...and once a week, the two are about cost-equivalent, so all that I'm doing is not paying the insurance <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D1\">and paying you directly; but because of that, seeing your more often increases the cost directly, so I guess I'm reluctant there, also, because don't have a lot of money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Well, the latter part-I mean, it's still an issue, but I don't know, maybe, the latter part is certainly if you came an extra time a week, I could offer you a reduce fee or more of a reduced fee for that extra time. It's still more than zero, so it doesn't completely [laughs] address it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F1\">but just to-and maybe that whatever we work out still feels like a little too much, so, you know, I appreciate that piece but just to let you know that that's an option.
