Out there. Really? I wonder where . . ? Oh \u2013 when I was putting on my jacket. See, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. (pause) Oh, man. I feel a little better today I think. Yesterday something was off. The weather . . . I just felt claustrophobic and a little stir crazy and really fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">annoyed. Not annoyed \u2013 something. Frustrated or something. I was just in a mood.  Today I am, too, a little bit; but I\u2019m a little better. (pause) I was thinking today about how my mom probably annoyed the shit out of my dad for years. If she annoys me this much then yeah, that\u2019s a pretty powerful dynamic <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">\u2013 parent and child \u2013 but man, wife and husband. I think she probably annoyed the shit out of him. I\u2019m just wondering I don\u2019t know how my dad could have possibly dealt with her personality. I don\u2019t know unless she was very different with him or something. I don\u2019t know.  She\u2019s very difficult. I\u2019m fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">shoveling the snow today and the plow guy comes. Okay, great. I\u2019m just doing the other stuff. She can\u2019t help herself. She has to come down. She\u2019ll yell things out like, \u201cDon\u2019t put the salt there. Put the salt here.\u201d I\u2019m like dude, are you kidding me? She just can\u2019t \u2013 do you know what I mean? She has <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">to really butt her nose in things. She can\u2019t not. It\u2019s not just me. It\u2019s her personality. It\u2019s not just me either. In conversations she\u2019ll always turn it around. You\u2019ll say something about like, let\u2019s say, your children. I can almost guarantee she\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, my Brian was like that.\u201d She has to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200135\">a reference point to say \u201cyes, me too.\u201d Like, \u201cYou have children that did x, y and z? My son did x, y and z, too.\u201d Or \u201cYour job is really hard? Oh, my God. My job is really hard, too.\u201d And it becomes about her job.  That\u2019s annoying fucking shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Never really seeing or hearing the other person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what that is. I don\u2019t understand what the fuck that is and I don\u2019t understand why . . . I guess her sister has it, too. I don\u2019t know. Actually, yeah, my uncle does, too, in his own way. My mom just talks the most kind of. My aunt does, too, actually. My uncle is like that. He doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">even ask how you\u2019re doing or whatever, really, so obviously it\u2019s all about him again; but at least he doesn\u2019t talk as much so he keeps under the radar a little bit. (pause) It\u2019s really annoying; really, really annoying. I don\u2019t know why today, of all days, I was like how am I going to handle this shit? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\"> This is insane. \u201cOh, I think the tenant is upset. Look \u2013 she\u2019s waiving her arms. I think she\u2019s upset.\u201d First of all, why are you just standing around monitoring whatever is happening out your door or whatever. That\u2019s just weird. Second of all, even if she is upset, I don\u2019t give a shit. If she is she\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">talk to me about it and, of course, she wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s really, really unbearable. It\u2019s really unbearable because, of course, when you get upset you\u2019re the one being weird. \u201cThis anger of yours. This is very bad.\u201d Dude, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I can only imagine that with my dad, pissing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">him off and then he has to feel bad because he\u2019s pissed at her idiocy.  (pause) I don\u2019t know.

What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Your mother looming with her criticisms and her judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Also because I have nowhere to turn really. Yeah, I can turn to some friends or whatever, but really, at the end of the day, it\u2019s like I\u2019m just sick of this shit. Sick of it. (pause)  In that way I do feel like I\u2019m leaving because of this. It\u2019s hard for me to separate. I know I\u2019m choosing to, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">but it feels like it; circumstantially, it feels like I just can\u2019t take it here anymore. I don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like that feeling. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019re running away from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s not in a pleasant way. It should be. I should reorient the way that I\u2019m thinking about it but I\u2019m having trouble between the money thing and her and everything just feels at a tipping point.  (pause) I\u2019m also realizing I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another choice unless I get really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">lucky and get some amazing job around here very, very soon. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: She was telling you where to put the salt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: She cannot not be hyper-vigilant about every little thing that\u2019s going on around the house.  It\u2019s impossible. Our house gets the most pollution from the street. You literally don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. That\u2019s the dumbest . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Pollution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, we\u2019re getting the most car exhaust. Our neighbor isn\u2019t. Eight feet away. These are two family homes, so eight, 20, 30, 50 feet away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Why that\u2019s even on her mind that she\u2019s thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Exactly. How long have you lived in Cheshire? What car? What are you talking about? It\u2019s beautiful weather here. \u201cNo, the last ten years the traffic is just unbearable. Dust and dirt.\u201d  \u201cYou know, this car yesterday parked in front of the house. It was just there for two hours.\u201d What are you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">talking about? Who the fuck gives a shit? Some of it could be old age, as she is 70, so as intelligent as she is she\u2019s an old lady now and that\u2019s stuff people do at that age. They start being curmudgeonly weirdos, but if it was in a cuter way and if she didn\u2019t have a history of driving me insane, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">one thing. But Jesus Christ . . . (pause) So she\u2019ll look at the neighbor shoveling and me shoveling. \u201cIt\u2019s enough, it\u2019s enough. Come inside.\u201d Yeah, okay. But if I come inside later you\u2019re going to bitch and moan that it\u2019s not clean enough.  \u201cThe neighbors \u2013 if someone slips outside I notice that it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">very icy on our side. If someone slips we would be in big trouble. They could sue us.\u201d All right. So then I\u2019m going to shovel it. Shut the fuck up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re getting sort of controlled and micromanaged and criticized whatever you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s how they are. They\u2019re all like that, these people, all of them. My uncle is like that. My friend, Dave, had to quit. He had an ideal employee that I had gotten. Dave, the guy that makes my rent, this fucking dude is like, \u201cLet me know if you ever need . . . \u201c This guy can come to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">your house and if you just said, \u201cI want to put this bathroom over there and I want to . . .\u201d I don\u2019t know how, he just can do it and he can do an amazing job. On top of that, he\u2019s an amazing designer. He\u2019s like a combo designer\/construction guy. It\u2019s perfect.  I keep trying to get him to start this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">fucking business, but he\u2019s just non-committal. He can come and fix shit and he\u2019s like, \u201cI think in here if you put this color, if you painted this wall like this and if we knock down this wall . . . \u201c It\u2019s just stunning the shit this guy does. So my uncle hired him and loved him in the beginning. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">guy shows up on time, works fucking hard, mellow guy, doesn\u2019t complain about anything, upbeat \u2013 all this stuff. And then it started. Dave dresses kind of like the way I would. \u201cHe\u2019s very scruffy. You know, this is a clinic.\u201d Dude, the guy is the construction property guy. How do you want him to show <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200354\">up to work? \u201cHe\u2019s got his beard.\u201d It started with that and then, at first, Dave would joke about it, but it got to the point where Dave was like, \u201cI can\u2019t. He won\u2019t let me do my job. I\u2019ll do something and then he\u2019ll be like, \u2018but if we moved it just two inches that way . . . \u2018\u201c I don\u2019t know what it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200355\">is about these people. Is that OCD? What is that, narcissism? I don\u2019t understand what that is. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t just let it be. Obviously, it\u2019s not a money issue. He\u2019s loaded. He can\u2019t even calm the fuck down and be like, \u201cHey, whatever, man. Two inches, whatever. It looks beautiful. Thanks, Dave.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560824\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: At least with your mother it sounds incredibly narcissistic. She\u2019s thinking about what\u2019s in her mind all the time, not at all thinking about what\u2019s in your mind or whether you think you\u2019ve done enough shoveling or just letting you do it, just trusting that it will be fine and you\u2019ll figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">it out. Why she\u2019s even saying \u201ccome in,\u201d for example. You\u2019re a big boy. You can come in when you\u2019re done, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s insane. I guess that is what it is, they\u2019re all just incredibly narcissistic. By the way, my uncle also fixed his nose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes, I just thought of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t tell me that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: It just popped into my head because of narcissism \u2013 I was just thinking about all of them. Yeah, he fixed his nose. And for a long time \u2013 I\u2019m assuming it was a lie. As I got older I assumed it was a lie because I remember being very, very little I was so attached to him. He looked like he had <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">gotten the shit kicked out of him and for many years the lie was that he broke it boxing, that he used to like to box and he broke it. Now maybe that\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t think so. Later it was pretty obvious that he had his nose fixed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Fixed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Whatever \u2013 done, plastic surgery, whatever it is. It\u2019s major, major. I have that, too, in me, obviously. I worked really hard.  I\u2019ve gotten very good at trying to just be aware of it and trying to catch myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: There is also, though, the kind of way you were describing narcissism as not just a pride, but more the idea of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s not necessarily about the way they look or whatever, it\u2019s overall like they\u2019re the center of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s different than vanity.

You\u2019re going to die a miserable rich man. Are you serious? My aunt is totally off. She\u2019s completely off her rocker with her crazy theories which, again, is all about her experiences, her thoughts are the main ones. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200592\"> Everything else is not to be trusted. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">I\u2019ll tell you, I caught myself. I was going to joke with my mom about these two Assyrian guys, from Assyria guys, who had a run-in with my friend, Jeff. These are like Assyrian folk musicians. They had a run-in with my friend, Jeff, who is also a musician. It\u2019s a soap opera-ish story. Long and short <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">of it, they accused Jeff of (chuckles) threatening their lives. This guy had to go to court and everything. Of course, he goes to court and it\u2019s completely thrown out. They\u2019re like \u201cwhat?\u201d That got completely thrown out. New Year\u2019s Eve these two same guys get arrested. Why? Because they showed up at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">a hotel at 6:00 PM before a New Year\u2019s Eve banquet where these other Assyrian guys were going to perform and they beat the crap out of them with baseball bats because they were kicked out of the band a month ago.  That\u2019s fucking hilarious and it also proves that these guys are animals, right? I caught <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B3\">myself, though, to tell my mom that because guess what? That\u2019s not a light-hearted . . . I can\u2019t be like, \u201cCan you believe this? That\u2019s fucking hilarious.\u201d \u201cYes, Assyrians are like this, the ones from Assyria. We lived there. I know. Those men . . . \u201cIt would become this whole fucking thing so I can\u2019t. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B4\">I can\u2019t share what I think is a hilarious story because immediately it will be that Assyria is some kind of monolithic \u201cthe men will eat you alive and they\u2019re all drunkards and fight and hoodlums\u201d and whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It becomes some grand [political] (ph?) statement every time, rather than the specific people of every situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s everything. Everything becomes that way. You can\u2019t say one word. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Women are like this. Americans are like this. It becomes so big and [bold] (ph?). There are no specific people, including you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: But in a sad way, there is also not really them because they clearly don\u2019t know themselves. That\u2019s just a robotic thing. They have no idea who they really are. It\u2019s sad. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560824\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: Why did you think it was hilarious? Because they got beaten with a baseball bat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Only hilarious because of the irony of it. They put Jeff through hell. They threatened their lives. The poor guy had to go to court and they completely pulled it out of their asses. The other guys are okay, by the way. I wouldn\u2019t have laughed like that if they were dead or something. They had <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">to get a couple of stitches, but they were released from the hospital. Just the idea. It\u2019s so buffoonish. Fucking 6:00 PM. You thought no one was going to . . ? First of all, you\u2019re attacking people who know you. So what? You just thought they weren\u2019t going to tell anybody? Lay there bleeding and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200672\">go to the hospital and have to file a police report? It\u2019s just buffoonery. I don\u2019t know if they still think they\u2019re in some eastern-European backwater or something but . . . (pause) I\u2019m realizing that I don\u2019t really have a choice. I should have realized this quite a while ago. Maybe I did start realizing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200673\">it; that\u2019s why I went to the U.K. and then I went back. But now that the job thing got fucked, now I really see that this isn\u2019t working.  Darien is not a place where someone like me in this circumstance can be truly independent. I would have to make a lot of money. I would have to have a job that pays <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200674\">me so well that I can live on my own, not have roommates, pay for all of my expenses, do this, do that, and still have money left over. That\u2019s just a reality. I would have to move to. And if I\u2019m not going to move \u2013 do you know what I mean? I have to try to just have a positive outlook about going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200675\">Assyria, that it\u2019s a good opportunity and that it will be great and blah, blah, blah. I just don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s terrible that you didn\u2019t have the [cottage] (ph?) for the next couple of months, that\u2019s what makes it really, really inconvenient, but [RJ] (ph?), this is what you wanted to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: I know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Again, there still feels like a way you forget that you\u2019re making choices, like \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d That could be a kind of paranoid fantasy that you\u2019re getting kicked out by the country without knowing that you are deciding you don\u2019t want to move. That\u2019s not the life that you want. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">You\u2019d rather move to Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: I get that, but there are choices and there are choices. Yes, of course, I\u2019m making the choices, but I just wish it were in a more pleasant manner. Do you know what I mean? It would be different if I was working, I had the money right now in the bank to buy my ticket and just be like, \u201cYeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">I\u2019m just going to go. This is awesome. This is pretty exciting.\u201d This feels very rushed and kind of slightly messy and something. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Of course it would be very good if I could just call up the airlines, charge my airplane ticket, have a few thousand dollars in the bank that I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">saved from years of working or whatever. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I have to cobble this fucking thing together and I\u2019m really tired of doing shit like that? Then I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to go there and come back and then be at square one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re as much scared that you\u2019re going to be there and it\u2019s going to be successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560824\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. It might be awesome. (long pause)  What I just keep reminding myself is that I think it\u2019s very healthy, this move. This is not working. This is just not working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: You were feeling that very strongly before you found out the unemployment was ending. Do you remember that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to remind myself of, that like I said, before I went to London, this has been a long time I\u2019ve been trying to get \u2013 you know. The difference is I\u2019m stubborn and I\u2019m trying to do it my way. I\u2019m proud of that and it looks like it might be working out now, but it\u2019s also tiring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: Once again, there is a \u201cyou\u201d making choices and sticking to something. You could have compromised those choices and go do something that you don\u2019t feel like doing and buy into that. You don\u2019t want to do that. You\u2019re not doing it. You would rather teach in Assyria and there is an opportunity <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">to do that that you\u2019ve figured out and see where that leads you, to play in Assyria, to write in Assyria.  (pause) Do you think about going sooner? I know you said friends had brought that up to you and it was hard to hear. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re looking for faculty for the Spring semester, in other words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Oh, you know, that didn\u2019t even cross my mind. The Spring semester. Wow, that didn\u2019t even cross my mind. I guess I could ask. I would assume that would be very soon. I could find out, I guess. Yeah, I could ask. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I know that\u2019s really soon. I don\u2019t know when their semester starts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: It just feels like teaching so quickly . . .  I should ask. I should ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: It might end up feeling too soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just worried that if I ask her, the way this woman has been, I have a feeling she might be like, \u201cYeah, we could probably hook you up with one course. That\u2019s short notice, but yeah. We probably could hook you up with one course.\u201d Then I\u2019m in a bind because if I say no, then I feel kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">bad that I ask. Do you know what I mean? Like, \u201cWell, on second thought, it\u2019s too soon. I\u2019m not going to come.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: You want to be prepared to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: I like our rapport. I like that I finagled it the way that I have and we talked and okay, it\u2019s summer teaching. But you\u2019re right. I wish I had asked that maybe before. That\u2019s when I should have thought of it. \u201cJust for the hell of it, I\u2019m curious. If I came in the end of December or January, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">what\u2019s that like?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right. I\u2019m not even saying that. It\u2019s just thinking about that as an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: No, no. It\u2019s not about right or wrong. It would have been interesting to have asked that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And I for some reason thought \u2013 maybe this is wrong \u2013 I had in my mind that she mentioned \u201cwe would love you here in the spring\u201d and you said to her . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Her whole thing is \u201cjust be here.\u201d She was like, \u201cYou could be here today and there\u2019s plenty to do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: You had to push her off. Didn\u2019t that happen? You said, \u201cNo, not until next year.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, that just seemed so . . . I\u2019m so not that way these days. I don\u2019t like doing that any more. I just want things to be a little more of a smoother transition and tie up loose ends. Also because at the time she kept saying there was plenty to do and I was like what the fuck do you mean \u201cthere\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">plenty to do?\u201d Will I be faculty or not? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty to do, but \u2013 so there was also that.  Until we ironed that out it was already early December or whatever. I could just go, regardless of teaching. Clearly I\u2019m going to find stuff to do, I guess. Yeah, I could just go whenever. Really the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200932\">only reason I\u2019m not is because everyone has told me they\u2019re having one of the coldest winters they\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s something like 7\u00b0 every day or something . My friends who moved there are like, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good first impression. You could get kind of depressed and it\u2019s just fucking cold and dreary. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200933\">You\u2019re not going to have a car. You can\u2019t just hop in your car and warm it up. You\u2019re going to be walking everywhere. It\u2019s a little intense if you\u2019ve never been here.\u201d  So my thinking was that I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to still be kind of cold in March, but now they\u2019ve had something like two or three weeks <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200934\">of 7\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 5\u00b0. It\u2019s unusually cold. But you\u2019re right, if I found a cheap ticket for February or something \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560824\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: Again, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s right. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m right, it\u2019s more just saying you actually have choices in front of you that you can decide if you want to go then or now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Some of it might have to do with renting the apartment. Probably in a week or two or whatever I\u2019ll start gearing up to put it on Craig\u2019s List or advertise it at Brown or wherever. If I find that someone really great comes along really fast \u2013 yeah. If they want it for like February 15th \u2013 fine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\"> (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: I also wonder if it makes sense to check in about paying for this.

(sighs) I actually was going to bring a check today but, of course, my checkbook in my car has no more checks in it; but I think I can pay definitely soon another $60 or $120 or whatever. Then I\u2019m going to have to, like everything else, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">just going to have to cobble it together somehow. I think I don\u2019t want to face the inevitable, which is that I have to borrow some money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Maybe from your mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: From a friend? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I have one friend, one older friend who . . . I just don\u2019t want to because he\u2019s so insane. He\u2019s been after me about fixing my car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: That one. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: My car didn\u2019t pass the emissions because of the stupid electrical thing so it\u2019s got a rejection sticker and every single time he\u2019s like, \u201cDude, just go find out how much it is and let\u2019s pay it. That\u2019s all.\u201d I hate that that\u2019s the situation that now I\u2019m going to owe him. I still owe my other <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A71\">friend for fixing my car because it\u2019s been piecemeal. Sometimes I can pay him a little bit back; sometimes I can\u2019t. And he\u2019s awesome. They don\u2019t care, but I don\u2019t like that, man. I don\u2019t like that, but I don\u2019t know what choice I have because I don\u2019t need like $100, I need a chunk of money. It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A72\">that my mom doesn\u2019t want to help me.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: [I\u2019m comfortable with it.] (ph?) I know there has been this balance. It\u2019s been sort of hovering in the same place [ ] (inaudible at 00:32:19) in the last few weeks. I know you can\u2019t pay that off before you go if you go.

I don\u2019t know exactly what the solution is. It has also occurred to me when you\u2019re there we wouldn\u2019t be able to do the recording any more in terms of paying for sessions if we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD1\">to do the same sessions.  Do you know what I mean? We can\u2019t record it, I don\u2019t think, unless there\u2019s some way of recording it. There may be some way. I can look into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">CLIENT: Recording as in what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: An audio recording of the session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well we could just record.

That\u2019s only been a year, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been maybe a year and a half with the recorders. It might be about a year, but again I don\u2019t know how it would work through doing that through Skype and I also don\u2019t know if you would be able to pay for it from there or how you pay for it from there, on your end of things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll still have my account here so what I would do is just an electronic from Baltimore Savings just to have them send to you. That\u2019s the thing. These things are fucking easy. (chuckling) If I had a regular income, long ago I would just send out this fucking check every month. That\u2019s what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">would do. That\u2019s the ironic thing. I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be able to afford it there because things will be different. Even here if I got rid of my car, for example, that one thing would be a big deal, but it just doesn\u2019t work here. Not that it doesn\u2019t work, it really is inconvenient so I held <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C32\">onto it, especially when my car is paid off and it\u2019s like I have this car.  But over there, there aren\u2019t going to be these other expenses that here are burdensome, like my cell phone. You have to shell out a lot of money for these stupid, fucking iPhones. I won\u2019t have that because in Europe they have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C33\">just a normal system where you just fucking top it off. You go put to $20 on it; that\u2019s what you use. What I\u2019m saying is regardless up until I leave I\u2019ll still try to chip away as much as possible and regardless of whatever we decide, then I\u2019ll just pay you through the bank.

It\u2019s a huge help. (pause) It\u2019s my only reason now to come to the Square. (chuckles) At least there is that. At least I can still come to the Square.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Things have changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: Insane <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Even though it\u2019s really hard for you now, I think you\u2019ve had some [results.] (ph?)

Your priorities, what your life looks like; it\u2019s been changing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely for the better. It feels great not to come to the Square all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I meant. That\u2019s just not where your priorities are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">THERAPIST: The bigger things, the long-term picture, what really [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:51) you in a realistic way is more front and center. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think you\u2019re right. I always try to remind myself because I am having trouble feeling excited, but I try to remind myself that it\u2019s just because it\u2019s a lot. There is also stuff here that is really frustrating and annoying so it\u2019s hard for me to just be peppy about going to Assyria. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E51\">Then I remind myself that it is pretty exciting; but I also feel nervous and scared because I think \u201cIs it going to work out?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">THERAPIST: This has been a long time coming, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s, I think, what it feels like inside. The trial run was going to London \u2013 and that was pretty good \u2013 but it didn\u2019t take because there was no revenue.  This is a totally different situation and a much, much, much, much, much cheaper place where I know people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And with revenue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">CLIENT: And with revenue \u2013 and not just haphazard revenue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">THERAPIST: And Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Which, if there was ever a destiny about a place for you to go (chuckles) \u2013 not that I\u2019m fearless. You know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s timing. It just seemed like the intersection between working hard on myself and opportunity and the right place at the right time just all coming together. It just seems like the smart and healthy thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: And realistic and thoughtful opportunity. It\u2019s not a kind of pie-in-the-sky, [hare-brained] (ph?) idea. It\u2019s real. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: Which, again, started with London.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: I went there for a purpose and it\u2019s not quite done yet, but it\u2019s closer than not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: You closed a book, though.
