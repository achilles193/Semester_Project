Yes, it was nice. Hot, too hot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s going to be 90 all week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yes. That sucks for my yard because I\u2019m not going to do a lot of weeding until the rain comes back so my weed whacker, that\u2019ll take some stuff up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: How big is your you\u2019re talking about your backyard?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: And my front. Yes, the sidewalk has some weeds growing out of it. Fucking sidewalk. I kind of want to salt the earth there, which is not a bad idea but with all the runoff that would be kind of a [inaudible at 00:00:26] kind of way because salting the earth\u2019s so good; kills plants. Also boiling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">their roots and then salting the earth works really well. I got some weed killer for again Roth Weed Killer will destroy -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Whatever\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: whatever\u2019s downhill, which is my neighbor\u2019s yard and the bushes between our yards. Yes that\u2019s the one real potential. I love those bushes; he loves his yard. I don\u2019t want any herbicide floating downhill. So, I\u2019m trying to work with Hank more. There\u2019s a woman who said to me a while ago about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">that her Beagle, her dog he wasn\u2019t too smart and I said no, Beagles are very smart but they\u2019re assholes. She said yes, they\u2019re really stubborn. And stubborn\u2019s another word for stupid, in other words it\u2019s very easy to mistake one for the other in a creature that can\u2019t really communicate verbally and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">tell you why [inaudible at 00:02:02]. But here\u2019s the communicative thought because I wasn\u2019t very verbal, vocal rather, [sound] so what does that mean? And we just assume he\u2019s saying I\u2019m doing what you guys do; seems to work. You guys do this all the time. I don\u2019t know what <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m trying to put thoughts to words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes. Is this what you guys want? Is this what we always do? And when he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019ll knock his food bowls around to get our attention. When I first had him, it was funny, when I looked down he was sitting on the floor, half on his ass, one leg out, staring at his water bowl which he\u2019s rolled <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">over to me. That\u2019s pretty good. That\u2019s pretty good. When Pepper has the Kong (ph), they both get a Kong (ph) and he finishes his first because his jaws are stronger, he\u2019ll go to Pepper because he wants hers because she has hers. And so he\u2019ll come whine at us. That don\u2019t work. He\u2019ll go whine at Pepper; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">that won\u2019t work. He\u2019ll try a couple barks at Pepper. That won\u2019t work. Then he\u2019ll go to the door and he\u2019ll bark at the door. So Pepper freaks out and runs to the door barking, [inaudible at 00:03:28] back at the Kong (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">So, okay these things are smart; these things are smart. Yet, they just can\u2019t seem to get other stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Kong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So I started doing clicker training with him, been watching videos on clicker training, kind of do it with him. And I tried a while ago to teach them not to bark at the road, to teach them to be quiet on command. So once a day we\u2019re supposed to just take the dog [inaudible at 00:03:54] that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">makes them bark, like the doorbell, ring the doorbell; when they bark, put them in reward mode; good for you. Now every time they do that and they bark then you start shaving the bark, you only reward for particular types of barks, like one [inaudible at 00:04:17] for clear bark; three [inaudible]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">And then once you got them doing one loud, clear bark, you put a word to it or something, so you get them to bark on command. Once they bark on command, you start rewarding them to stop barking, so basically between barks. And Pepper just could not get it. She says whiff. I said no, that\u2019s not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">to work. Nothing. Okay, you know what? I put Hank down. Oh treats, nice. You want me to bark? Bark. Bark, bark, bark. Okay, too much barking. Bark, nice. Okay, good, so he got that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560015\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: So what do you use? You use -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a clicker. It\u2019s there for training dogs. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: So it just makes a click sound?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yes, just a [click sound]. And it\u2019s faster than doing that so the sound is the trigger. That\u2019s the thing with this. What the click means is what you did was the correct thing and it rewards them. So, it\u2019s been a while now and we\u2019re getting frustrated with the time [inaudible at 00:05:21]. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">going to try some easier stuff because he couldn\u2019t get the not bark stuff. He said I could bark, and he was really bark, bark, barking for treats, let\u2019s do this. And now I\u2019m trying to do attention where they look me in the eye. You\u2019re looking for that contact so you cannot You can say their name and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">they\u2019ll look at you in the eye and that\u2019s what you want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Especially with a Beagle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019ll say what? What would be the command for change?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Things like, he\u2019s probably desensitized to his name by this point. So you say something like hey buddy and he\u2019ll what, and he\u2019ll look. It\u2019s getting [inaudible at 00:06:05] better but I said okay I need to back it up because he\u2019s still having tricks, trouble with the treat in the hand. One thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">I noticed, treats in the hand, you leave the treat there. .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Not go for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes, one [inaudible at 00:06:19]. So I need to back up for that part in order to focus on that where I get him to just [inaudible at 00:06:26] as soon as I leave the treat, I get the treat. Fine. They\u2019re not too focused on how do I get that treat. I\u2019m going to teach you but you first need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">chill. But I\u2019m trying to teach him that and he\u2019s thinking treat. Bark. Fuck. No, it\u2019s not bark. Bark. That\u2019s not what I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting. Right, but it\u2019s late and bark too much with the treat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right, he\u2019s thinking it\u2019s this, I know how to do this. I know this trick. I bark; you\u2019re moving your hand, that clicker, you get a treat, I bark, and you give it to me. Yes, that\u2019s one thing to do. But I was wondering because Gabriel\u2019s really teaching the dog how to communicate, these are the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">things I want you to be able to do. And it\u2019s easier I know Hank pretty well. As the dogs get older they start getting more independent. It\u2019s interesting. So Hank will not often, if it\u2019s middle of the day, he won\u2019t start [inaudible at 00:07:18], he\u2019ll go somewhere else, like yes, I was just downstairs <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">on the carpet, thought it would be fun. Whatever. And great. Used to be he couldn\u2019t he\u2019d bark for me. He walks better now, as well, now that he\u2019s older. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: How or would he go off on his own?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: No, he\u2019ll he doesn\u2019t do no. That\u2019s way down the line.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560015\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s way -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: He knows wait.

Okay, yes. But sometimes we go [inaudible] when I was [inaudible at 0:08:03] doggie into the street. I don\u2019t understand that. But he does know once we cross the street we\u2019ve got to cross the street quickly. So he\u2019s thinking okay let\u2019s cross. So he knows that but I don\u2019t believe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">he understands traffic at all or that there\u2019s a central [inaudible at 0:08:22]. I don\u2019t think he has any concept of that. You can\u2019t let him off the leash because he\u2019s a Beagle and part of the problem with Beagles is a scent [inaudible at 0:08:28]. It\u2019s a real issue. They catch a scent and forget, hey, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">hey dog, Hank, dog, hey. Nothing. They just lock on and follow the scent. Follow the scent. [0:08:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Oh is that right? And they block everything else out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s what they\u2019re bred for. So their focus will drive you nuts. And so he\u2019ll do that and you have to walk up to him and tap him and he goes whoa and I say okay let\u2019s get inside, and he says yes, okay, sure. So that\u2019s an issue. So there\u2019s only some much you can expect from hounds sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">in terms of look at me. Once they get locked in then you can\u2019t with the distraction so. And it\u2019s possible you can. Once you can train him to do some things but nothing the dog [inaudible at 0:09:18]. Sometimes there\u2019s going to be things your dog wants more than whatever you\u2019re working on with him and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">that\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to work on. Well with the Beagle, I found this scent; I want to walk this much more than whatever you\u2019re offering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Okay, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Unless it\u2019s [inaudible at 0:09:39] in which case it\u2019s harmless and you can jingle it, he says oh fuck let\u2019s go for a walk and he runs in, I put it down on the ground and say oh Lord. Motherfucker. But he knows about his leash and he knows where we keep it it\u2019s on the back porch. So he knocks <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">it over and says hey, we should go on a walk. Yes, you\u2019re right we should. So more often now I\u2019m trying to take him on walks once a day. He\u2019s pretty heat sensitive, though. Today [inaudible at 0:10:13].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: He knows his limits, he knows his [inaudible at 0:10:13], he doesn\u2019t knows \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t know if he knows his limits; he reaches his limits. [0:10:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: He reaches his limits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s not just in the reverse pug (ph) season, which just sound awful. I think it\u2019s wicked tired, sort of heat sensitive. Pugs are heat sensitive in general and he\u2019s got it. He\u2019s got scent [inaudible at 0:10:40] from the Beagle, the heat sensitivity from the Pug, he\u2019s got the buck (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">glands [inaudible] from the Pug as well. He\u2019s got a lot of these sounds from the Pug as well, which is fine. He\u2019s got loyalty from the Beagle like you wouldn\u2019t believe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. One thing people agree on about Puggles, one guy put it really well, is that Puggles are really into their owners. You are awesome. Man. Gosh. I make more food for you because you love it. You take your love and put it in that special receptacle so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re devoted, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes, oh yes, totally. Totally. He gets really excited when people he hasn\u2019t seen in a while come by to the point where he\u2019s just a Beagle, like open, not quite open, not quite. I\u2019ve seen him open before but -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560015\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Open?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Open\u2019s something that Beagles do. It\u2019s like a bang (ph). It\u2019s like bang (ph), which actually is a particular version of Beagles, they\u2019re just, it\u2019s all open; they become a tube for sound. It\u2019s the loudest, commands attention. When he did it, there was this bigger dog that was over, kind of a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">nippy dog. Not a [inaudible at 0:12:02] dog, another dog, she\u2019s older, kind of bug-zap people. Certain dominance but not, doesn\u2019t actually connect, just kind of nips. And Hank did not like that; he was really kind of worried about that. And so she\u2019d come at him he just, he\u2019d go as low to the ground <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">as he could and charge at her and goes boo hoo, this sound that comes out and she\u2019d bolt and run away and look a wreck. Back up. Hank would go do his stuff and she\u2019d come back. Boo hoo hoo and she\u2019d say aw fuck, it\u2019s like that and he\u2019s saying go away I don\u2019t like you. So he was very clear about that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200673\">He does some similar sound but it\u2019s more like super hyper excited like [sound] like he\u2019s being stabbed in the heart when he sees someone he hasn\u2019t seen in a while. [0:12:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes, or he thought you were dead.

So sweetheart. Loves kids but doesn\u2019t understand that they\u2019re fragile. He just runs right over and he\u2019ll try sniffing and pushing his nose, and they\u2019ll fall down and then he\u2019s oh sweet you\u2019re on the ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Now let\u2019s play more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes, step on it. Now I\u2019ll lick you and some kids think it\u2019s funny. I don\u2019t because it\u2019s gross.

A number of months ago when she was over, she loves Hank. He was licking her feet and everything and she\u2019s [up on her desk] (ph) laughing and she\u2019s touching his face and he was licking her face and she was laughing and he was licking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">her and [inaudible at 00:13:37] takes her down. So he goes away and she goes [crying sound], reaching for him and he comes back and licking her feet again and he thinking this is the best thing. Then last week she\u2019s over and Hank is like oh man you\u2019re amazing and she\u2019s freaking out. She\u2019s saying oh <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">no, don\u2019t come near me. So we put her upstairs to take a nap and she puts her into the carrier thing she has to put on top of Ginny\u2019s bed and she closes the door and she doesn\u2019t realize there\u2019s a latch on our door in our house that you have to click it shut. Hank runs upstairs, I hear a baby crying, -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Now I want to see this baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes.

But when Hank hears her crying he runs to the door like you need to get in there. He comes rushing to us, bark, bark, there\u2019s a baby <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">crying, let\u2019s go.

And she\u2019ll hold up behind [inaudible] like I\u2019m not going in there. She\u2019ll pick up a treat <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">like this is a treat. He says oh sweet a treat, and runs in and she closes the door, you\u2019re not getting another treat. He says come on. So now he\u2019s sort of this is a treat, he\u2019s says no, no. So she picks up the box and says this is a box of treats and he goes holy fuck and runs in. But now he doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A72\">because this is a trust thing. He thinks I don\u2019t know; sometimes she gives a treat and he\u2019s like oh, okay sometimes there\u2019s a treat.

And he knows other stuff. I try to teach the dog to sit down, be calm for me and Hank sees me getting food slams his ass to the ground absolutely still. Just ready. Unless he\u2019s on his feet scratching at the refrigerator like come on, come on, get into the thing, I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">\u2013 which she\u2019s supposed to learn by watching Hank. So she says come on, I\u2019ll pour Hank his food in his bowl, take your food. I say here\u2019s your food. And then she says let\u2019s eat. So he looks at me, his tail wagging, and I say eat and he says fine. [0:17:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">But I can\u2019t get her to sit for it.

Defiant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: I mean when she now, she doesn\u2019t want to go in the crate at all. Usually we\u2019ll put the dogs in the crate when we leave the house because we leave the house and they bark and howl where are you and they kind of freak out. Okay. We put them in the crate they look around the crate, this is all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">the space I\u2019m responsible for; this is fine. But now it\u2019s to the point where you\u2019ll go to put her in the crate and she wouldn\u2019t go; she\u2019ll look at the bed. She\u2019ll get on the bed, she puts her paws down and when you walk out of the room she stays on the bed. And I say okay she\u2019s signaling she\u2019s using <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B92\">the bed instead. Fine. So if we\u2019re all in there [inaudible at 0:19:00], get on the bed, close the door and that\u2019s fine. Now she says I\u2019m just going to stay in the house but we go out the front door and she says I\u2019m staying on the couch. I\u2019ll pick up her crate no, she\u2019ll run back down to the couch so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B93\">I\u2019m just going to stay here. And we said fine so we\u2019ll go. She\u2019ll bark a little bit. Usually when people pound on the door she\u2019s freaking out. People pound on the door, bark, bark, bark, bark, total fear and long barking, when she\u2019s alone in the house and we come back in, totally silent.

And Hank\u2019s thinking [inaudible] losing her shit now? Calm down. But Hank, though [inaudible at 0:19:56] listen to things. People [breaking the door] (ph) he\u2019ll just sit down. Sit, instead of ruff, ruff. He\u2019ll be quiet and ruff. And Pepper\u2019s running <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">around and [inaudible at 0:20:08] and we\u2019ll try to contact her, stop her and she spins and dashes off under the chairs barking the entire time. And he has this thing called the fear trumpet. So it\u2019s just a cough. You\u2019ve seen Kongs (ph) before, dog toys? [0:20:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: What are they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Kongs, kind of rubber conical things; three doughnuts, one on top of the other, essentially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Oh yes, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yes, they can chew on it. You can throw inside peanut butter or whatever. When people ever leave the house she freaks out as well so what I would often do is I\u2019d pick her up before people would leave because she\u2019s like if I\u2019m being picked up I\u2019m fine; I\u2019m not afraid of the door. But what we\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">often do is say Pepper, go get your fear trumpet, that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. So she\u2019ll run and get her Kong, she\u2019ll hold the smaller one in her mouth, there\u2019s a hole, and she will howl through the Kong, which amplifies the sound.

I don\u2019t know how but it kind of gives you an assessment of \u2013 so they show him a treat [inaudible at 0:21:26] show him a treat, he doesn\u2019t come. Put the treat on the ground, put the cup over the treat, see if he gets the treat. How long does it take him to knock <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">over the cup? Pepper\u2019s like fuck it, wham, treat, done. Whereas Hank was oh God, oh where did that treat go? He\u2019s sniffing around the cup like oh it\u2019s under there somewhere. The first time I gave it to him he failed; he never figured it out. The second time I used a lighter cup just to make sure it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D92\">wasn\u2019t [a thing] (ph).

Pepper\u2019s like okay, snarkle, snarkle, snarkle, uses her nose, things like that to get the treat. Great. Hank\u2019s like oh God, oh okay, sniffs around it, kind of paws <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD1\">at it, tries to bite the treat through the thing. It\u2019s crunching but it\u2019s good enough; he rolls over with the thing in his mouth, crunching on the treat [0:22:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: inside the thing. And I say it\u2019s not good, though. You don\u2019t actually have the treat. He\u2019s like this is good enough; this is good. And there\u2019s one where the smaller dog and a dishtowel [inaudible at 0:22:58] blanket thing over his head, [inaudible] cover it over the head and count now long <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">it takes them to get it off. Pepper\u2019s like oh fuck, shakes and backs off; it falls off her back. Great. Hank, I put it over him he\u2019s like oh God; he starts to spin, slams into a wall, he starts to spin some more so it slides down over his shoulders and he slams his ass [inaudible at 0:23:17] like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">did it.

He\u2019s not good about getting out of things. And oftentimes he gave up and he\u2019ll start \u2013 he\u2019ll [inaudible at 0:23:45] and whatever he is cloaked in, unable to see it\u2019s a full sheet he\u2019ll stare and start <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">wagging his tail right there until you get him out of the sheet. Treats under a barrier. [inaudible] a barrier, treat underneath it, get the treat. If you get it out with your snout or [inaudible at 0:24:04], how soon does it take them to use their hands to get it out from there? Hank tried once, kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E52\">of bumped his hands, I can\u2019t do it; sits down, looks at me and says I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t know what to fucking do now. I tried; couldn\u2019t do it. Done. So James says okay so maybe he knows he can\u2019t get his paw under there. That\u2019s really stretching it, though. What you really have to do is he knows he can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E53\">do it so he\u2019s given up. That\u2019s really what it \u2013 I don\u2019t know.

But he gets the training so much faster. And Pepper just doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s just no, no, no, no, no, I don\u2019t want to do that. [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">at 0:25:09] she knows how to do; she knows how to sit and wait for treats, she knows how to lie down, she knows how to do that, get in the crate, get up on the bed, whatever.

Kind of like a chart I fill in every time I come in. Always the questions like is your mood better in the morning or day? Or I have thoughts of killing myself but I wouldn\u2019t do it. I have thoughts of killing myself every day. I\u2019m depressed <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D1\">once a week, twice a week. That sort of thing.

If it actually gets better as I get older then I\u2019m fine with 400; <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A11\">I don\u2019t want it to go up any more. I can\u2019t get a recurring prescription going because every time they call to refill automatically they cancel it.

It\u2019s always okay for the mother to hit her son as long as it\u2019s just in the face but never on the butt because <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD1\">that would be sexual abuse.
