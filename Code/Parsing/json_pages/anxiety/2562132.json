Wait, four. Wait, no three because $66.57 is the amount that I\u2019ve been calculating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Okay, that sounds like three. I think it\u2019s $22.19 which is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Each, yes because we met on last Friday, the Monday prior, and then this Friday, no the Friday prior and then this Friday, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yes, I mean I\u2019ll be doing billing this weekend and so I\u2019ll look through it all -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: And so you\u2019ll see, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: and verify that you\u2019re right, which I\u2019m sure you are. So $66 -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: $66.57.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: $66.57, okay. And then you\u2019re out Friday and Monday so after today we\u2019ll meet a week from Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes, the first Friday in February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yes. [Pause] [inaudible at 00:01:34] send you a receipt? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: You may. That\u2019s okay, thanks. So I\u2019m really looking forward to my trip. I\u2019ve just been trying to get through these three days at work, which are really busy. So on Friday night I happened to hang out with Stephanie which was very nice, fine, whatever. We were talking about Helen, bought some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">food, made some dinner and stuff; it was nice. And <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: When is your actual birthday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Friday, the 31st, so yes. I think that I\u2019m, well I\u2019m I\u2019ve been feeling more agitated the last couple of days than I have just in general and I don\u2019t know it could be a little bit like PMS. And so the prescription says to take it, to take the 20 milligrams instead of the 10 milligrams five <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">days prior to mensees (ph) but according to my birth control pack, I\u2019m about a week away. But then every month I\u2019m going to be oh, I\u2019ll just start the [inaudible at 00:03:01] sooner. And if I\u2019m doing that then I\u2019ll just obviously talk to him next time, maybe I should just do, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">But so because I\u2019m less than five days, because supposedly I\u2019ll get it Monday or Tuesday of next week, so I took 15 milligrams instead and that seemed to help today in terms of not feeling as emotional which does leave me to kind of believe that it is just my hormones kind of kicking in a little bit <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">more, the week prior to having my period so fine. Maybe that\u2019s the case but I\u2019m just less agitated at work and I was agitated. Just the kind of the standard is to come in and read my e-mail and get infuriated at everybody because I\u2019m just so sick of doing everything. But I closed my door for a while, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">slammed my door, and left it closed for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">I really got to reel in the whole temper tantrums at work but it\u2019s just hard to do for me in general. And then I get really annoyed and I just want to close my office door. But I really need to I don\u2019t know. Maybe this vacation will help a little bit. [I mean [inaudible at 00:04:10] the time off but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">when I said oh but I got back and if I would be refudinated and I didn\u2019t] (ph). But maybe now I don\u2019t know I think maybe I\u2019m just feeling a little uncertain. I\u2019ve been telling everybody how excited I am to be 30 and how I don\u2019t feel any older and it\u2019s so cool because I don\u2019t feel 30 but I think actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">now it\u2019s starting to, I\u2019m starting to have a little bit of I don\u2019t know panic or something because I just don\u2019t I\u2019m not where I wanted to be when I was 30. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">And my living situation continues to irritate me. She texted me when I was at Stephanie\u2019s (ph) on Friday night and asked if it was cool that her friend Frank slept on the couch since he\u2019s a wreck. And I said yes, no problem, just please give him a sheet and a pillow from your room. We\u2019re not 20, we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">don\u2019t just do couch crashing anymore. I have nice throw pillows. So of course I come out on Saturday morning from my bedroom and his feet are shoved up against two of the couch cushions. And he\u2019s sleeping on the throw pillows and he\u2019s sleeping on the other one and he\u2019s in his leather jacket and jeans <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">on my couch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And I didn\u2019t really I actively avoided Helen for the rest of the weekend. I just couldn\u2019t I was busy; I was in and out of the house and and she had left pizza out all night and left pizza crusts on the table and just not okay for me. And so I just really didn\u2019t want to talk to her. Then on Sunday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">yesterday she spent the night at her parents\u2019 and this morning I did a big cleaning of the house. I got up early and did the cleaning, my pre-vacation cleaning, which I usually always do because I figured she\u2019s not home. At least I won\u2019t have to feel annoyed at her laying there and saying oh, can I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">do anything, or if I just want to make noise or whatever, yell, that kind of stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Now I got a text message from her today. She\u2019s still doesn\u2019t have a job oh, and I wanted to maybe sit down and have the uncomfortable conversation of this isn\u2019t working for me, this bothered me. It also bothered me that she washed her wash, because her idea of washing is rinsing, I think, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I pulled them out and they were still greasy. She washed the plates that she used before she left on Sunday and I had a couple of mugs in there and she couldn\u2019t even just wash them. And it just really I\u2019m sick of that. It\u2019s just do you not notice that I do it for you Helen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">And I was going to have this uncomfortable conversation with her even though I really don\u2019t want to because then if she doesn\u2019t say sure I\u2019ll try to move it\u2019s just going to be uncomfortable because I can\u2019t kick her out. I mean I can only tell her that I\u2019m not enjoying this and she can say well it sucks <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">for you. Even aside from the whole feeling kind of I was telling Stephanie (ph) in the car and I said oh it\u2019s perfect that she\u2019s asking this question because this is just what I was talking to Ethan about earlier, about feeling like I should tiptoe. And Stephanie (ph) said no don\u2019t tiptoe around the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">message. Just be polite, don\u2019t be passive-aggressive just be polite and direct. And I did and she said no problem and then just didn\u2019t do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Wait, so I missed something because I was distracted thinking about something you had said. So, what was the message?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: That yes, of course no problem for your friend to sleep over just please use a pillow -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yes, I remember that. Okay so that was the message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: and then she didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right, yes. No, I got that. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: And I was talking to Stephanie (ph) about maybe I should phrase it differently or maybe I should explain why I want her to use -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Oh, now I get it, yes, yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: And she said no, you shouldn\u2019t have to explain to her why she want, you want somebody to sleep on the pillow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: The one part of you that\u2019s thinking that way and the other part of you that\u2019s ready to throw her out the window.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Exactly. So, and then I realized okay she has an interview tomorrow so just in the sake, for the sake of being a decent person let me not approach her about this and hey you suck as a person; good luck at your interview tomorrow. It\u2019s just whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Then she sent a message today and it kind of worked out that she did that because she sent a message today that said can Lucy sleep at our house tonight? Lucy meanwhile is the friend that came over that night. No she\u2019s fine, she\u2019ll be fine. Can I flick a bowl and put [inaudible at 00:08:27] asleep? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">And so I wrote back this is, and I was trying to be oh shit, wait, no I want to get my book; I want to read this to you. So and then after, I called my mom before I sent the message because I said I don\u2019t know if this is not okay to say or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">So I wrote, she wrote hey is it cool that Lucy stays at our place tonight? I said of course, no problem. But this time please make sure that she\u2019s not sleeping on my throw pillows like Frank ended up doing last Friday. That was why I had asked you to please give him a pillow from your room. When she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">going to sleep, all you have to do is move the throw pillows. [Laughter] And then I said to my mom is this really condescending? She said no because clearly you didn\u2019t explain it before and she didn\u2019t do as you politely asked so clearly she needed it explained to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">I mean because it\u2019s one thing that he ended up, if he ended up just sleeping on the pillow. But she didn\u2019t even take the other ones off. They were in his feet and he had his feet on my pillows. And I said also I did a big housecleaning this morning so please try to keep things nice. And she said okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">thank you. Need any help? And I said later I\u2019m taking down the tree. She said okay, thank you. Need any help with the tree? So she responds normally. I just don\u2019t know is that because she knows that she\u2019s mentally retarded and so she says well let me not play her on this because I know I\u2019m dumb for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">having forgotten or maybe it really is oh that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want him sleeping on the throw pillows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Wait, I\u2019m missing something. So you\u2019re wondering about sort of why she responded in this kind of amiable way? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s going through her head. Yes, she wasn\u2019t defensive, right, like well gee, sorry. And she didn\u2019t not respond. I mean her response was normal but I guess my question is then why is she not normal? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m not thrilled about her friend sleeping over tonight either. I\u2019m thinking dude I\u2019m about to be gone for five days. You can\u2019t just let me fucking have the you can\u2019t I just everything about her I hate. [Pause] Why does Lucy have to sleep over tonight? Why doesn\u2019t she just move in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">with Lucy? And I\u2019m also going to have to talk to her about while I\u2019m away and if I can count on her to scoop my cat litter or if I should plan on having my mom come over to make or if she would just prefer me to bring them to my mom? So I have to ask her that and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll say no of course I\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">be here because she likes the cats but I\u2019m just not convinced she\u2019ll remember to scoop their litter. And they\u2019ll be pooping on poop for a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal well whatever. Her behavior, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal. I think she\u2019s acting like a 20-year-old boy. The whole crashing on the couch thing, we\u2019re not dudes. We\u2019re girls, this is my home. I don\u2019t know. And she\u2019s actually used that term before like hey can my friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">crash on the couch? I said no. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">I don\u2019t know. I mean I\u2019m feeling excited about this trip. It\u2019s just that I feel just so dissatisfied with work and my home life and my social life and the whole dating life that I\u2019m just I don\u2019t know having a hard time keeping things in perspective and not feeling like a loser and not feeling frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">and I don\u2019t know. Stephanie (ph) got into the whole I\u2019m really sorry but I know you hate hearing this but I really just think you need to just live your life and not be looking for a relationship or dating. You just need to be doing your thing. I said okay, that\u2019s easy for you to say buddy. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">And then she\u2019s explaining how her friend Becka who\u2019s she\u2019s trying to think of her only other single friend and how her friend Becka is just so busy with work and is always working and doing stuff with work friends or she has a good networking group of people. But who knows because then she\u2019s not dating <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">and she ends up sleeping with random people and feeling shitty about it. So I said okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: So I mean I think it\u2019s related because backing (ph) up to your roommate I guess part of it is that she also makes, she kind of makes you feel like an early 20-something by association, which in a way is kind of the last thing you want to be. So when she has somebody crash on the couch it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">doesn\u2019t just reflect on her but also on you because it\u2019s also your apartment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">And kind of still the thing that isn\u2019t so clear to me anyway is the sort of guilt that you feel or the inclination to kind of tiptoe around her or the more reasonable she gets, when she gets reasonable, sort of be more cunning. Well maybe I need to, I\u2019m being a little ridiculous here to make my point, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">maybe I need to write her a little essay about why I don\u2019t want her friend sleeping right on the couch in order to make sure that it\u2019s really clear and you know what I mean? As if the onus is somehow set on you; it\u2019s not on her anymore. To just do the straightforward thing you\u2019re asking her to do is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">on you to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Explain to her how to do this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right, which -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: And then in turn it makes me feel like well maybe it\u2019s a ridiculous request or maybe it isn\u2019t as straightforward or maybe it\u2019s not normal or maybe I\u2019m being really anal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Right. Right, and I guess that\u2019s [pause] or I mean last time you were saying you kind of feel, or you felt guilty. I guess not in that particular instance but with things like that. I think you were mad at her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right. Well that\u2019s more for I\u2019m mad that you\u2019re lumped on the couch depressed or whatever, just watch that I\u2019m not, your idea of the good life is to lay around all day. But then I felt guilty because maybe it\u2019s not. Maybe it\u2019s just her depression. Maybe it\u2019s the Fibromyalgia. Maybe I\u2019m just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">being a jerk and to each his own. And yes, to a certain extent to each his own but it doesn\u2019t mean I have to like living with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Right. But I guess that\u2019s also, I\u2019ll try to make it this way, there\u2019s something also the way it comes out for you. It\u2019s not like, you don\u2019t really say oh my God, okay. It doesn\u2019t come out in terms of how you feel. It usually comes out in terms of judgments of her. In other words it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">like oh my God, it bugs the shit out of me when she\u2019s lying around; I find it really depressing and it makes me feel like we live in Depressionville or it makes me feel like, it sort of drains my energy too. I mean which I think it\u2019s, you\u2019d probably say is part of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">It\u2019s more like she\u2019s ridiculous, she\u2019s a lump, she doesn\u2019t do anything you know what I mean? It all comes out in terms of choices for her that then you doubt, you know what I mean? And I guess part of what I\u2019m confused about a little bit is I mean if you because in a way it seems like kind of simple <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">or more straightforward if you were to be saying yes it depresses me when she\u2019s a lump on the couch all day. It sucks my will to live when she\u2019s, all she does is lay around the TV in part because if you say that then you\u2019re right about it. I mean it\u2019s not really about her per se but you read she\u2019s ridiculous, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">she\u2019s a lump, she\u2019s this, she\u2019s that, oh my God I feel guilty because maybe it\u2019s her Fibromyalgia or her depression. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">There you\u2019re kind of on shakier ground and you sort of go back and forth and get anxious about it. And in a way what you\u2019re talking about is something about you but you don\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019m not trying to be critical or trying to say well you should be nice to her; I\u2019m just, I\u2019m trying to understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">what leads you to be sort of focusing in this way on sort of judgments on her and then sort of guilt and questioning of yourself for those. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause] I mean I know that when Franklin had problems it always turned into my problem instead of his problem. The problem wasn\u2019t that he was talking to other women; it was that I was checking his phone you know what I mean? So when I would say I have a problem with you talking with other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">women, he would say well you wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it if you weren\u2019t checking my phone. And that\u2019s almost like the opposite of what I\u2019m doing here kind of. Right, I\u2019m putting it all on her. Like I\u2019m being him I guess in this scenario. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Maybe that\u2019s defensive, maybe it\u2019s I don\u2019t know because yes it\u2019s my problem that I have a problem with that being how she wants to live her life. But even if that\u2019s my issue it\u2019s, I\u2019m not causing it. I don\u2019t know how to think about it because <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well maybe you, maybe you just don\u2019t tend to feel all that much like real justification for the things that bother you. And so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yes. I mean don\u2019t really; I don\u2019t like it. I mean some of the things yes when it comes to dishes not being cleaned properly, people messing up my stuff that I purchased and that I own like the couch cushions, yes I can say something about that. I can say something about the dishes; I said something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">about the trash. But about some of these like she can have some complaints about living with me that she\u2019s just not letting bother her as much or something. I don\u2019t know because really if I decide to have this conversation, a conversation with her about it not really working and me not enjoying living <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">with her, if she doesn\u2019t say well I\u2019m going to move out then we just have this big elephant in the room. And I\u2019m kind of left being the bad guy, I feel like, who\u2019s complained about a situation that maybe can\u2019t change until the lease is over because neither of us can afford it or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yes I think you really don\u2019t tend to imagine the other person will be accommodating at all. In other words that at least that she might respond by saying oh I didn\u2019t realize that was affecting you that way. Sometimes my body hurts or I\u2019m depressed and it\u2019s hard for me to get up. But I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">see that that is a pain in the ass for you; I will try. In other words even who knows how much she\u2019d actually change but that seems to me something quite different from well you\u2019re fucked because I\u2019m living here, I\u2019m on the lease, and I don\u2019t feel like doing anything or I think this is all your problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: No and I don\u2019t think she would respond that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: No, I don\u2019t think you I know you know she wouldn\u2019t but I think that you anticipate that either she\u2019s going to say all right I\u2019m out of here and leave or I think you\u2019ll feel that essentially that is what you will get actually. I know when you picture her that\u2019s not the kind of thing she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">would say, but I think you don\u2019t tend -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: Yes, kind of okay, what am I supposed to do kind of thing is what I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes, that she\u2019ll sort of feel attacked and take no real responsibility and make no change to accommodate reform. And I think there\u2019s a part of that that has very much to do with what you expect from people. And sometimes, yes, I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t happen that way but I guess yes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200891\">[inaudible at 00:24:03] your family I get often how you end up dealing with them and I have a sense that and sort of with Franklin (ph) also with some things, well with other things actually. In some ways he took care of you in a really nice way but then there were other things, I guess mostly when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200892\">there was conflict, it seems that this was how he handled it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. And I mean but the other part of it though is I don\u2019t want somebody to change their way of living or how they like to live for my sake because I mean in a roommate situation because I certainly I mean if she said well could you stop smoking weed in the living room I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">say no, or whatever. So I feel torn about talking to her about, I mean at that point it makes me feel like it\u2019s more of just a personality clash and lifestyle clash. But, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Well [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not her mother. I can\u2019t be saying pick up your clothes. But at the same time it turns into an issue when she leaves her door open and my cats go in there and chew on something or she\u2019s tracking dirt around the house because she never cleans her room and it\u2019s just a pile of clothes everywhere. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">And so I have trouble I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">THERAPIST: Okay, is that entirely true? If she said okay I want you to stop smoking weed in the living room, I get it that you would say no. But I could imagine other things where if you felt it was a reasonable request and it wasn\u2019t bothering you too much -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">CLIENT: Yes. But I don\u2019t do too many things that are bothersome to roommates. That\u2019s what I think I do my dishes plus others dishes, I clean up after myself, I keep the house clean, my room is certainly clean as hell, I try to be respectful when she\u2019s in the living room watching TV and not put my <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">music or TV too loud so it doesn\u2019t compete, you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">Why isn\u2019t she ashamed of how her room is? One of my friends came over, who was it? Did you ever see the movie Half Baked? It\u2019s a stupid old movie with Dave Chappelle and a couple other comedians and it\u2019s about these stoners and they go to whatever, get into some trouble, whatever. There\u2019s this character <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">in the movie called The Guy on the Couch and he\u2019s just in their apartment all the time on the couch and he\u2019s a raider, what the hell is his name? I think he\u2019s the one that did oh whatever it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s this comedian guy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">And I forget who came over but somebody said all I can think of when I see your roommate is Guy on the Couch because she\u2019s always laying on the couch under a blanket whenever anybody comes over. And I mean I said ha ha ha, but at the same time I\u2019m, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want my friends to feel uncomfortable. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200991\">And it\u2019s awkward. She\u2019ll be laying on the couch to the point that I\u2019m standing there with my friend and she says oh and then gets up so there\u2019s more room to sit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">But yes, if there was a reasonable thing that really bothered her I think you\u2019re right, yes. Or maybe even if she did ask me not to smoke weed like she\u2019s quitting or they\u2019re [inaudible at 00:29:31] or whatever, even that I could probably say all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well in fact you\u2019re saying that some things you already do like you make sure when she\u2019s watching something your music isn\u2019t too loud.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Right. And it just feels like she doesn\u2019t do any of this stuff unless I tell her to. And I\u2019m just sick of telling people to do stuff. I\u2019m sick I spent the whole year telling Mariana what to do, I came out of this retarded relationship where I had to be the one to talk about everything and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">bring everything up and then break up with him and move him out and tell him to move out and I\u2019m just sick of telling people stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">But I mean reasonably what would be, what, I don\u2019t even know what the right thing I could say to her is about the stuff that bothers me after the stuff I already told her that bothers me that she\u2019s trying to fix. Like, this is how you wash a dish. I don\u2019t know. Who leaves pizza out overnight? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">I\u2019m trying to count my blessings and stay positive. It\u2019s just like the Celexa\u2019s helping me but it\u2019s not changing my life. I mean it\u2019s just helping me not be as upset about it and kind of manage it a little better and take things in smaller bites which is really all very helpful. And it\u2019s a lot. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">like things are a lot different for me and better in terms of how I\u2019m managing my life than they were the last whatever months. But at the same time I just still feel like I\u2019m on this hamster wheel kind of. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">And I\u2019m going on this trip with Amanda and Stephanie (ph) and so it seems that they\u2019re making the deal out of my birthday and stuff and my mom I\u2019ve been talking to her about it a lot and whatnot. I don\u2019t know I just know if I were in a relationship it would be a thing. We\u2019d be getting excited and whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A91\">And I don\u2019t know neither my dad nor Julie have said anything to me like so anything in mind special for your birthday or oh can we give you some money for the trip so you\u2019ll enjoy yourself, nothing like that. And that has been kind of sad for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">I planned this trip for myself which is very nice and I paid for the stuff myself and whatever but I think that it would just have been nice to have somebody else kind of and I know my mom\u2019s really excited for me and stuff. I also know she doesn\u2019t have any money to give me, which is fine because she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB1\">been asking me where are you staying and where did you get a car, and when are you going and when do you land and all. You know, she\u2019s excited for me as well but I feel very hurt by my father and Julie and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">I don\u2019t know. And it pisses me off when Stephanie (ph) says things to me like why do you think having a boyfriend will fix your life. And I don\u2019t think that. I think it would make it more enjoyable and I think that it would make it so that the things that I\u2019m trying to fix like my job and my finances <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF1\">and my living situation that I\u2019m struggling with seem a little less urgent or prevalent or obtrusive in terms of those difficult times. And I know she\u2019s said yes it would be helpful if I had more friends. You know what she\u2019s trying to say is that you need more friends. I said yes, I know I need more <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF2\">friends. And yes, for whatever reason I\u2019m a little nervous about turning 30 and kind of just <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Well I mean the problem you describe with your roommate, with Stephanie (ph) and with your dad are that in a way they\u2019re kind of impossible to get through to. None of them are really able to have a sense of where you\u2019re at or what they could do that would be helpful. I mean in a way they <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B11\">don\u2019t really any of them seem to know what\u2019s going on or what you want from them despite your sort of efforts with Stephanie (ph) are you able to make that clear or with your dad just assuming he\u2019s got to do something about your turning 30. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It feels like a big birthday and it just feels like I\u2019m the only one that feels that or something. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Well maybe part of what you want is like for, and you\u2019re probably right. I mean what would happen if you were in a relationship for somebody to make it very special, who would want to make it a special thing for you? I mean your mom who\u2019s excited and eager and that\u2019s fine her roll isn\u2019t to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B51\">make it nice for you. I mean it doesn\u2019t sound like you resent her for that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">CLIENT: No, I mean she did that my whole life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">THERAPIST: But it also seems like that\u2019s kind of what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yes, for someone to and I know that Stephanie\u2019s (ph) planning something for my birthday that maybe her and Amanda are or whatever but I don\u2019t know I\u2019m feeling the lack of a partner, a romantic partner.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yes, well I think it\u2019s actually I think that is absolutely true but I think it seems like very specifically what you are feeling a lack of that your romantic partner would provide or somebody else could is somebody who really kind of was motivated to yes kind of make things nice for you <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">CLIENT: Right, like as excited about it as I am. As excited for me as I might be or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yes, I guess, I think there are sort of pieces of those around your roommate where you\u2019re doing things to make the living space nice for both of you and it doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s doing that. Even if she\u2019s not going to buy you flowers the way a partner would, or Stephanie (ph) who could be <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C11\">like, instead of being kind of critical or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: Trying to find the solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: just saying yes it\u2019s really hard to be alone or socially it\u2019s lonely or I mean any other thing she could say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: My birthday weekend, yes, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It is kind of maddening, Stephanie (ph), that in a way it\u2019s clear that she knows what it\u2019s like but she never responds to you at least you never tell me about her responding to you in ways that actually make you feel any better about it; probably it\u2019s worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s always worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">THERAPIST: In other words it isn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t know you\u2019re lonely, it\u2019s that she always kind of finds ways to blame you for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">CLIENT: Right. You\u2019re concentrating too much on it, [inaudible at 00:39:44] for you, you\u2019re worrying too much about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Rather than, yes it seems oddly enough typical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yes, like I wish it were easier for you without all the other shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Right, yes, I wish it were easier for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s what my mother does now. She says oh you really could use some luck, you could use something special happening, I\u2019m praying for something like that to happen, you know? And that\u2019s more helpful than anything anybody could say because it just shows care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: I mean in any case I\u2019m -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I guess that\u2019s part of my point is I don\u2019t think that\u2019s kind of, that\u2019s the kind of thing in different ways that you\u2019d want a boyfriend to be doing too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: Right but other things but yes exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yes, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: And that what Aiden does for her. And they\u2019re both going to be I mean Amanda not as much because her and I just don\u2019t talk on the phone as much but I\u2019m sure Stephanie (ph)\u2019s going to be the whole fucking time on my birthday, even I probably couldn\u2019t say hey for just my birthday could you not <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E31\">because she\u2019ll get mad at me. You can\u2019t ask that of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right, she\u2019ll be texting every five minutes and saying you know it\u2019s really not all about being in a relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Exactly, like I don\u2019t understand why you think it changes your life so much but let me tell him what we just did and send a picture of my toes in the pool. And it just feels also like it kind of sucks that I have to say to myself okay I have to try and not let that bother me. I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E71\">have to worry about anything bothering me on my birthday weekend trip. But I am. I\u2019m worried about being jealous, I\u2019m worried about being able to go out and talk to guys because they\u2019re in relationships and shit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yes it would be nice if, much nicer if you could just look forward to it and be excited about it. I mean I can see why you can\u2019t, I\u2019m not trying to tell you that you\u2019re sort of doing something wrong but I\u2019m saying it\u2019s too bad, it\u2019s unfortunate. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562132\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yes and I, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I do understand you\u2019re still somewhat excited about it but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yes, totally. I mean mainly because I just need to get the hell out of the cold and it\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve had a vacation. I do wish I were more excited for the celebration portion. I mean I don\u2019t know what it is yet but it\u2019s just going to be the three of us, which is nice but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">THERAPIST: You were sort of hanging with a bunch of people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You were still going to meet a bunch of people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">CLIENT: Kind of. Or I wish yes and I kind of feel like Stephanie (ph)\u2019s doing it and that\u2019s very nice because she\u2019s my best friend but it\u2019s kind of only so I don\u2019t have to do it myself. It\u2019s not the same kind of feeling that she put into planning her own big birthday. And a big surprise and this -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I see.
