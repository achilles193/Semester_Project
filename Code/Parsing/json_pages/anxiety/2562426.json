I\u2019m sending these samples off later today and everyone is going to give me last-minute submissions. (pause) It\u2019s kind of hard to deal with people or put up with . . . Like yesterday, I was in our office across the street helping out. [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">at 00:02:36) In the morning, one of the post docs was giving me samples. He\u2019s very talkative and repeats himself over and over again, like giving me samples and giving me information and telling me all about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Like verbose?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah. He\u2019s French, so I don\u2019t think he gets it, because he\u2019s very pushy. I don\u2019t think he understood that I was very busy and I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d So then while I was out he sent me this long e-mail like here are the samples; here is how he got the samples. In the morning, I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">showed him where to put the samples and I was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to be out of the office for a couple of hours, so put them here.\u201d The box was marked with my name.  I had orange tape on it, very bright. He was like, \u201cI put the samples in a box. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s yours. It says \u2018Molly on it.\u201d (both <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">laugh) I was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s mine.\u201d Then I get another e-mail where he\u2019s taken a series of photos of the box. (both laugh) Oh, my God. Yes, that\u2019s it. Then I get one more. I was like, \u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d and I think he could tell I was perturbed. I was like oh my word. Then he sent me this e-mail, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">\u201cI hope your experiment goes well.\u201d Blah, blah, blah. I know you were trying to be nice because you could see that I was upset because you\u2019re taking up so much of my time for something so simple.  I can\u2019t be like \u201cokay, everything is fine\u201d and be nice because then it draws him into talk more and ask <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">me questions about things unrelated to science, so I\u2019m just like ugh; I don\u2019t know. I was getting kind of angry. Then another one of our techs is out sick and I was trying to help out with people who needed her. It was a lot.  (pause) I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m kind of feeling extra anxious because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200135\">have to be there tomorrow and so I\u2019m not there to control some of the craziness or something. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I guess I feel a little unsettled. I think it\u2019s not only because of work, but because of figuring out different options of moving my furniture. Should I ship it or should I just sell it all? Moving \u2013 it\u2019s very expensive to rent a truck and drive it and selling it all \u2013 but we\u2019ll see; so I\u2019m just feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">kind of unsettled until things are kind of concrete or [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:49).  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: So some of the stuff with work and then with the move it\u2019s feeling out of control?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right. I guess I\u2019m kind of worried how to best handle it because I\u2019m frustrated with people. (pause) I talked to my mom for a short time last night and I was explaining different options about shipping the furniture. I said it seems like a lot and I don\u2019t want to deal with it.  She said, \u201cOh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">it\u2019s just something you have to do.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI know that, mother. I just want to complain.\u201d (both laugh) I was getting upset. (long pause)  I guess I want to remain in control or keep myself calm, but then when things like what the French post doc are doing puts me over the edge. I feel bad because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">I know he\u2019s just that way. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562426\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I find myself thinking in terms of a parent and a kid and good behavior. You need the French post doc to behave and he\u2019s not behaving. He\u2019s just not behaving, he\u2019s just chatting too much and taking 17 pictures of the box and taking up too much of your time and \u201cI don\u2019t know if you got it\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">and continuing to take up your time and apologize for it.  It was frustrating and difficult for you when he wouldn\u2019t behave. Your mother was a little bit the opposite. You wanted to blow off some steam and her attitude was like, \u201cWell, you know, you just have to deal with it. It\u2019s something that\u2019s on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">you to fix.\u201d In other words, you weren\u2019t behaving for her, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right. She wasn\u2019t being very comforting or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, she was treating you as though you were doing something kind of wrong in wanting to complain to her about it.  Something about it can feel to you like it actually throws her. Like it\u2019s not so much that she was going \u201cwell, you\u2019re not behaving properly,\u201d it\u2019s more like \u201cI can\u2019t handle <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">this.\u201d \u201cWell, this is something you just have to deal with.\u201d (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I guess in her mind she thinks things are easier, [but it\u2019s not.] (ph?) It\u2019s like her way of not wanting to deal with it or think about it.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I actually think this may come up fairly often here, where you have this overarching sense that there is a way you should be doing things, both out in your life and in how you talk here, and that I know what that is and, even though I don\u2019t say so, I kind of expect it of you; and that\u2019s pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">uncomfortable if you don\u2019t know what that way to do things is.  It\u2019s like there\u2019s something quite wrong. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I guess I feel bad to sit there and kind of be angry at them, angry at this post doc or my mom. I mean, the post doc was being nice, it\u2019s just his way of being nice wasn\u2019t convenient for me.  And my mom, that\u2019s her way of supporting me, by saying \u201cjust deal with it.\u201d It makes me feel bad to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">sit there and pick apart them, so it all comes down to me better dealing with it or I need to handle myself or I need to be doing something else to keep calm and not get upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: It should be, though, because either one of them is actually recognizing what you need. I take your point that you feel like there is something the matter with you when you can\u2019t make use of what they give you or, at least, take it more in stride.  I know that bothers you a lot. At the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">time, I think it\u2019s also true that they\u2019re not really recognizing what you do need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like that\u2019s selfish or I\u2019m being rude or something.  (long pause) It sounds like they\u2019re doing what they think is best. The post doc is just trying to be nice, trying to make sure everything is in order, but I\u2019m not putting in my best.  I\u2019m just like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got it. Leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">me alone.\u201d (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not how you really describe it and not in the feeling, at least to me, of how you originally described it, which is much more like they are responding to their own anxiety. I guess I could look in my notes. I don\u2019t remember exactly what you said about the post doc, but my impression <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">is that you said he\u2019s just kind of this way and he gets worried. You made it clear you had a box with your name on it and it\u2019s big and then he sends you all these pictures of it. The way you describe it, it\u2019s not as though he\u2019s just sort of like \u201cwhat\u2019s going to be most helpful for Molly? I\u2019ll send <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">her a bunch of pictures just so she knows I put it in the right box. I don\u2019t have to, but that will be most [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:01).\u201d  It\u2019s more like he\u2019s really worried that he\u2019s not bringing the samples in correctly. Or with your mom, something about the way you describe her and how you say it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">it\u2019s like the only way she can deal with your wanting to complain or be anxious about this drastic, big, interstate move is to shut it down; more so than she was saying \u201cI could just listen to her complain and I could just sit here and be supportive, but I don\u2019t think that, at the end of the day, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B4\">what\u2019s going to be most helpful to Molly. I think what\u2019s probably going to be more helpful is for me to put it back on her and just tell her to do it.\u201d  It seems more, as you describe it, like she just kind of can\u2019t tolerate the stress or something and has to, like in a tennis match, just hit it back at you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562426\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: In the moment, I was angry and then when he was sending me these e-mails I was angry. I wasn\u2019t really angry with him, I was just like \u201cthis is ridiculous.\u201d Then I immediately felt bad because I know that he\u2019s just trying to be nice.  And with her, I think her only way of being supportive is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">just trying to motivate; just do it. (long pause) It feels to me like it\u2019s picking your battles. I could sit there and be extremely angry at [Fabian] (ph?) and just chew him out like \u201cI\u2019m busy, too. You\u2019re wasting my time. You don\u2019t make it simple. I don\u2019t want to hear about other things. Just give <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">me the samples and give me the information that I asked for.\u201d I could just sit there and chew him out, but it\u2019s not worth it for me to make him upset and things like that. And with my mom, I could go into \u201cyou don\u2019t do anything all day. You can\u2019t spend a little time doing some research or helping me <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D3\">out?\u201d It just doesn\u2019t seem worth it because it would just make her upset. It won\u2019t improve anything. It\u2019s like I need to better deal with these situations or not make myself [horrible] (ph?) to them.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I see. In a way, it sounds to me like I\u2019m sort of not giving you the room you need to deal with these situations. Are you saying that I\u2019m suggesting you should push back on them in the ways that you mentioned, like chewing them out? That\u2019s not what I had in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s just in terms of telling them what would be better or kind of like whatever I need to not be upset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: I guess, to be clear, in my mind there is some space. There\u2019s a gap between it\u2019s your fault and you shouldn\u2019t be frustrated with them. You should roll with how they\u2019re being on the one side and chewing them out or telling them they just can\u2019t do this this way because it\u2019s completely unhelpful <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">on the other.  For example, my sense is that you\u2019ve tried many times to have that conversation with your mom and it doesn\u2019t work; and part of why you\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t want to have it with her is that you have and it just upsets her and probably frustrates you and nothing good comes of it. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">certainly makes sense to me; but I guess that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re wrong in thinking she\u2019s not being helpful to you or that it\u2019s your fault if she\u2019s frustrating you. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562426\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: For some reason it just feels like that\u2019s the wrong way to go about it, being frustrated, for me to criticize them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Do you mean to criticize them in your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. I should just better handle it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Does that mean that there\u2019s some kind of disconnect that you don\u2019t like or a rift? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Disconnect between what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You and them. In your mind, you\u2019re frustrated with them but you don\u2019t anticipate it will be helpful or constructive to take it up with them. You\u2019re saying that there is something about that that just doesn\u2019t feel right, that feels like that\u2019s the wrong way to handle it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: I am angry, so it kind of comes off passively that I am upset. So then I guess I feel bad for doing that or just having that feeling of anger towards them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: So partly what you\u2019re talking about is a pretty judgmental anger. It\u2019s not just like you\u2019re angry of them, but you\u2019re angry and critical of them so it seems disingenuous, like it\u2019s probably going to leak out anyway that you really find how they\u2019re treating you seems pretty wrong.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: I just feel like I\u2019m not handling it well, both being critical kind of builds in my mind but then I also worry about how it\u2019s affecting me and how it\u2019s coming off in my interactions with that person . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: I take your point, though, that there are two strong feelings that are on top of each other. One is that you should be able to accommodate how they\u2019re being and not be bothered by it, but just let it roll off of you. The other is that you\u2019re angry and also quite critical in a way that, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">some reason, or in a way that seems important, but, I guess, it\u2019s kind of mysterious to me.  It feels like that has to be a part of the conversation, seeing a little kid, like a four or five year old doing something wrong that they were doing but that they really weren\u2019t supposed to be doing, but not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">saying anything about it \u2013 like breaking things or being disrespectful or making a big mess or something. You don\u2019t just sit there and say, \u201cOh, well. That\u2019s kind of annoying, but I\u2019ll keep it to myself.\u201d Somehow that wouldn\u2019t be right. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Being critical helps me kind of explain their actions, but then it\u2019s always like it might not be true. It\u2019s just a story in my mind. It\u2019s always so negative and I don\u2019t want to be like \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d  It seems like that\u2019s the wrong thing to do, like there is a more positive <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">way of dealing with it or stopping the behavior that\u2019s upsetting me or whatever. (long pause)  It\u2019s also that I\u2019m angry at them and feeling mad at them. I don\u2019t know why in the meeting I have to get mad, but I\u2019m so fed up with what they do and their actions and it kind of seems weak or petty and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">it\u2019s hard for me to interact with them. Then it feels so false and forced and I just get angry.
