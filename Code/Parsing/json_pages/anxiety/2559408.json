And to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">MAN: So, Tanya's a little bit -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Tense. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">MAN: Tense today. She had a session with Chad the first (unclear) back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I'm wondering whether, do you have any other times open during the week? I'm finding that trying to see Chad and then coming here, I feel really drained when I come here and I feel like I don't have as much attention as I want to have and so I can I think Chad is trying to figure out how for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">me to meet with him on Monday so I can try to switch the time earlier this morning with him or I can try to switch this time with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay. What are you looking are you looking to meet on a day you're not seeing Chad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Just not quite so close.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Back to back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I could yeah, let me take a look. It sounds like your schedules are otherwise fairly flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: I should have something. I'm teaching a course but it ends at the end of January so my Tuesdays are going to open up a lot because I teach on Tuesdays. So that's a possibility and I'll take a look. The other possibility is Thursday afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Okay. I meet with him on Thursdays around 1. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">MAN: Probably not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Sorry. I don't have anything else on Wednesday or Monday at this time. I definitely will have something on Tuesday afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, that sounds like it would be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I (unclear) on Tuesday mornings but I'll talk with him about seeing if I can switch this morning time to Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: See if that and if not Tuesday afternoon is definitely a possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: So we're going to try to try to switch to Monday anyway instead of Thursdays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right. Wednesday afternoon might open up and early in the afternoon might be a possibility. I don't know if that's going to help much. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, check in with him and if not, I'll let you know what times I could do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Okay, thank you so much. Yeah, so okay, I'm tired but we had a really good Christmas, actually. It was a really good visit with family. I personally am doing a lot better. I feel like we are doing pretty well right now, too, which is really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">MAN: I think both of us are right and I think you look worse at this specific moment than you've been most of the time since we got back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: That's true. Yeah. You know, things are ratcheting up again. Yeah, visiting family was good. It was a little tough. It's always a little tough, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Tough in what way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Oh, we have lots of family and they really like us which is good but they want to spend a lot like all of our time with us and they all have lots of opinions lots of opinions. And so figuring out how to kind of stay sane and stay centered in the middle of that can be hard I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Is that about right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">MAN: Yeah, that's about right. I think we did a pretty good job of that in two different ways. This time around though, the first was you just went away when you needed to and everyone seemed okay with that and that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559408\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I feel like I have trained people into being okay with me sleeping, which is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">MAN: And the other is we, some of the time we reduced our visits with people to just one person at a time and that was also really good. So we had probably the best visit we've had with your mother in years by virtue of having no one else around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think the trick is not to see her with my siblings, just to have the two of us to be there with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: What makes that better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: She feels like we gang up on her otherwise, the three of us. She never says that but she really likes to be the center of the conversation and I think she feels lonely and distant from us because my siblings and I are very, very close and my sister kind of raised my brother and I and I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">because my mom left and I think she feels badly about that and really wants to be the mom but doesn't really have a very clear idea of what moms do and we tend to resent it when she tries to be the mom and also I think my sister is less good at hiding resentment and frustration than I am around my mom. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">So, you know, it's easier for things to just like slide off my back than Amanda and I get anxious when Amanda is worked up or upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">MAN: I think Amanda is still really upset with your mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I'm pretty upset with her, too, but I have very different ways of handling it than Amanda does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">MAN: Yeah, I think Amanda just doesn't want to see her and so when they're in the same place there's already one person who is upset and several of the other people can tell when someone's upset. You and your mother being particularly good at it. And it all just bombs out of control from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: My mom always does the thing where I'm always the good child and Amanda's always the bad child. We know I'm very much her favorite and you would think that that would be a good thing for me but it's really not. And you know, I just worship Amanda and always have and so you know I think mom wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">to be closer to me than Amanda is and that's not going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: How old were you when she left?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: I was seven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: That's really young.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was really bad and I missed her a whole lot. Amanda was I guess, nine and a half and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Did she leave in part because she just couldn't function?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: She, I mean, I think she tried to kill herself. She left. She either tried to kill herself or she ended up in the hospital one way or another but I think she tried to kill herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">MAN: She's told me that she never voluntarily ended up at the hospital so I think she tried to kill herself, but that was the only time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: But not until latter days at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">MAN: So I think she probably tried to kill herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, so she was she just wasn't functioning. She was certainly really unhappy with my dad. Something needed to change and so it changed. But, that's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">MAN: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">MAN: Some kind of an understanding, huh? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: But so, James and mom get along really, really well. She just adores him. She likes men but she also really likes you. I don't think there are really that many, I don't think there are that many people who are involved with Amanda and I, who know us, who don't feel the need to take sides between <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200891\">us and mom. I think you're very good at, yeah, at not taking sides, even though also you are on my side.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559408\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">MAN: I'm totally on your side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">MAN: But I don't feel like there's any battle that needs to continue going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Exactly, that. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">MAN: Which I think is itself a problem but all of your siblings are bound to this because I think there is very much something going on for Amanda. It's just not a resolved issue. It's not an issue of the past. It's a present issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: And you know it's a present issue for me, too, I think. I just placate along with Amanda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">(Pause): [00:09:42 00:09:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">MAN: I think you feel obligated to see your mother more than Amanda does. Do you think those are the same thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: I think they're similar but not the same thing. And in a way that's really good that you are with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Was it okay for you, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">MAN: Yeah. You know, it was you know, like I said, it was the most pleasant visit we've had with her mother and I guess in the time we've been dating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, well we started dating when she and I weren't talking. Like that was right in that mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">MAN: Yeah, so that was okay for me. And of course, there was only one person. I had a bit harder time with my family this time around than I have had recently. Not that I don't love them or not that I don't get along with them really well, it's just that they when Tanya and I come into town they tend <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">to just all show up at the parents' house all at once. Really, like the four siblings and two of them have spouses and children and it's a whole bunch of people there and I'm not very good at crowds. I can talk to a person one on one or a couple of people in small conversation, but there are no small <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A32\">conversations when my family gathers anymore. (Cross talk). (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: One person will say something contentious and another person will jump on them and then everybody else starts in, too. It's yeah, yeah, mostly on Cory, his second to the youngest brother who is nothing if not contentious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">MAN: He's young.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: He's sort of just learning to keep his mouth shut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">MAN: Sort of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Not like keeping his mouth shut all the time. He shouldn't do that but learning like when to pick his battles is the hard thing I think for him. You know he likes to disagree violently with a statement and then say hold on to being right regardless of what is actually the case at all. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD1\">that naturally irritates people, so yeah, everybody jumps on him. I ended up talking a lot less in those kind of conversations because I feel like it's not that I don't have an opinion, it's not like I wouldn't feel comfortable sharing my opinion, it's just I feel like there are enough opinions flying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD2\">around already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">MAN: And I often feel like I have to sort everything out or help everyone see why the other person is not an idiot and why they can believe what they believe and things like that. It just gets to be very tense and a lot of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: You do a lot of mediating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking that word \"mediator.\" Is that what it feels like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">MAN: Often. Yeah. And often even when so most of my family have a lot of strong opinions and often though, they'll overstate a claim to a large extent, you know. Anyone who believes this must be an idiot. I just knowing a lot of people who believe whatever it is they're saying, I tend to feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B51\">maybe they need to relax those views just a little bit in order to interact with other humans in the world. So I guess I end up feeling like I have to mediate between my family and each other and the world, often.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559408\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think it doesn't help that a lot of times that person who believes these things and thus is an idiot is me, and I'm not always going to say that I violently disagree with somebody but, or maybe not often I'm going to say that, but James usually knows and so I think a lot of, or a fair <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">amount of trying to say, 'well, you know, some people can see it this way,' out of care for me I guess. I appreciate that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">MAN: Without having any anti confrontations between you and whomever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, because you know God forbid I have a confrontation (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">MAN: Well, but that's the other thing, right? If you actually had a confrontation they would all just walk away from the issue. They would just abandon some element of their belief because they really like you, but then they wouldn't really know what to do. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I've gotten better at speaking up when I disagree with things. Sometimes it's useful and sometimes it's not. I think they really like me and I really like them. Which is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">MAN: Again it might not be huge. It might be Franco or Cody or other close friends who of all of my friends seem to have really liberal views and my family is very conservative. I don't know how that happened. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: I was going to say, 'that's what you get when you go away with Tanya,' but yeah -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">MAN: There were plenty of unexamined conservatives there.

So those two plus seeing Tanya's mother alone and that being really good, it was kind of like, 'ah, okay, maybe there's a straight forward answer here just like let's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">all gather except for maybe for a meal here and there. Let's just mostly visit in small groups.' Which I think was said before but I think maybe we'll stick to a little bit more next time we visit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I found visiting with just your dad and just your mom difficult as well as good. Because that was the only time when it was incumbent upon me to talk about what's going on with me and you know, that's really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">MAN: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: James's dad asking, 'how was I doing, what was I doing now?' You know with job searches and so forth. It just took a lot out of me to answer. I had to go back and go upstairs and hide for a little bit. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: What was hard about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: I am just really scared. I am really scared about looking for a job and really ashamed that I don't have one. I worry that James's parents will think I'm not a good wife for their son and I worry that I'm not doing what I need to do to keep us going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">(Pause): [00:17:27 00:17:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: And then when we're at the museum with James's mom we ran into a friend of mine from high school, which I knew was going to happen. I wore nice clothes to the museum specifically because whenever I go out in San Antonio I see people I know. And you know, I really like this woman and her husband. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">I just don't want to talk to anybody.

The sort of fear that this is sort of a momentary (unclear) of betterness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">MAN: Well, I know she's right but it sort of splits into several pieces. One piece is that there's a self-fulfilling prophecy there like she's constantly inspecting how she's doing and that makes her worse over time. Most of the time. And so she's just going to get worse as time passes and nothing really <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201951\">good comes along. That might be correct. That's how I see it. Another is the longer she goes without a job the more time she'll have to beat herself up about not having a job and so she's going to get worse. It's sort of a (Pause) how do we keep moving forward with the steps necessary to find a job <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201952\">in the short and long term without (Pause) it taking so long that she can't bear it. I feel like it is true conditional upon her continuing to be unemployed but this is a temporary respite. But if she's employed in a job that is fulfilling for her, whatever she likes, I don't know that it's true or <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201953\">I don't know that relapse will be nearly as bad as it's been in the last few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: That'll be nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">THERAPIST: Do you feel that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: I want to say what about what the benefits of having a job could have for me but you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2019A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559408\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">MAN: To use a different word?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Optimistic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">MAN: Yes.

I've changed day to day so much in the last year so many times to try to like I kept thinking if I can just get to this place with all the external stuff then the internal will be better and it just hasn't happened. So. Yeah, I guess I'm less optimistic about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">MAN: I guess the other piece that I didn't have is that given a long enough time of more or less stability, I really think that what you're doing with Chad will work. So, because I think it is working and so I think that part of the point of the job is not that like to fix you or something but that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD1\">it gives you guys and gives us time to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">MAN: And I think that it will do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">(Pause): [00:38:38 00:38:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">MAN: But I thought that before.

I'm not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: I know. Just being the optimist can be kind of a burden.

And pretty, doesn't let what he wants to happen interfere with his judgment of what is going to happen most of the time. I try not to.

Usually it's noted as pause. I don't think they normally note because I've actually seen transcripts. I usually don't. I just basically provide the audio recording although transcripts are very helpful. But a huge bonus actually if someone transcribes the sessions <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB1\">so you can look it over (cross talk and laughter).

Oh, we're just making fun of you for (unclear) talking as much. Although it's not even that you don't talk as much, I think.

But I was just thinking about you know, how much like plans and structure and how among the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202131\">things that are difficult about your situation and Tanya's situation together is sort of how amorphous and unpredictable it is. I was thinking that when I asked I forgot exactly what it is that you said. It wasn't the comment about feeling inadequate. It was a later comment and I asked you, 'oh, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202132\">you were less optimistic that a job would make a difference and I asked where it went in you and you sort of thought it as sort of a plan. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20215\">MAN: I sort of thought it was more of a map than a plan because it was kind of a the difference is like a plan is something that I'm trying to do and a map is a description of what may happen. I feel like those are different things and they're importantly different. You have to have a map before you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202151\">can have a plan. I don't have plans, or the very small rudiments of a plan which is like kind of help Tanya to make small steps on both getting the short term job like substitute teaching and a long term job like teaching next year. But that's about all I have in terms of a plan. But I have something <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202152\">like a map of where we're going or where we might go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">CLIENT: Sorry I made fun of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20219\">MAN: That's okay. It's all right to (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021B\">CLIENT: No, not at all.

So it is a lot less structured in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20221\">MAN: Well, that seems okay. We've covered a whole lot of subjects. Part of what I was thinking about during the pause was that kind of breadth of things we ran through more or less quickly.
