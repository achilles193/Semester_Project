It\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">of I have a feeling that I I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to do those things, so I guess it\u2019s just kind of hard to organize.

(pause) I don\u2019t know. Kind of catch up on things that popped up while I was with them or, I don\u2019t know, I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">didn\u2019t feel like doing more work since I was kind of, I don\u2019t know, doing something I don\u2019t really like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Something that took a lot of effort or time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

Just like [very provoking] or like I didn\u2019t want, you know, just kind of feeling stuck. I didn\u2019t really want or know what to do or what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">I wanted. I don\u2019t know.

And yet I gather you\u2019re feeling pretty overwhelmed by kind of having a wide open space of being able to do what you wanted. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. Like something about like having (inaudible at 00:09:18). I think I\u2019ve said this before. I talked to Vicki last night and kind of said some of the things. I always feel like I need a break or I need time or I need to recover.

I mean, it can be a little clearer what, you know, is anxious about work or, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">know, having to show these people around a lab for a couple of days. But it\u2019s less clear what about having time to yourself becomes so overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: (pause) Right.

Or even like seeing people, I don\u2019t know, or watching TV or whatever or working out. It\u2019s not I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">It\u2019s not like enough to kind of combat I don\u2019t know.

It\u2019s hard to like I mean, [I\u2019m just thinking like I should make my day not so bad] or kind of slow down or something. But I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s I don\u2019t know.

(pause) I also feel like I\u2019m in this habit of, I don\u2019t know, winding myself up and then kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">and then like going home and kind of doing -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Mmm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

I get it that dealing with these people at the lab was not nearly as bad as dealing with Lolo a few weeks ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Although it still sounds like you\u2019re not in a great place with it. The two things I\u2019m thinking of are, you know, feeling crummy as you were leaving yesterday and sad and sort of not wanting to talk about or get into it here, which is fine. I just assume that\u2019s because you anticipate, or at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">least partly because you anticipate that, you know, if we talk about it you\u2019re going to feel dragged back into it and it\u2019s going to be upsetting and kind of throw you off or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">And so (pause) I guess what I\u2019m thinking of is it\u2019s as though there\u2019s some kind of difficulty or upset from that experience that\u2019s like tough to digest in a way. (pause) And you\u2019re worried that (pause) the other things you might do, like watch TV or go to the gym or talking about it here, somehow aren\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F1\">really going to help much with that. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m just saying it seems to me like this is one way to describe the problem that you\u2019re having at the moment.

So I don\u2019t like I don\u2019t know. (inaudible at 00:23:10). Like it doesn\u2019t really register with me. It doesn\u2019t get in. I\u2019m just so focused on what else can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">I give them or what else can I teach them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: How can you make up for it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) So like I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even fully aware. I\u2019m just kind of in this zone of quickly thinking what\u2019s next, what\u2019s next. It\u2019s not really like registering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, or kind of I\u2019m getting a sense if they\u2019re getting it or no. But I don\u2019t know. So it\u2019s kind of, I guess, easier to forget or I don\u2019t know. In the end, I just felt like I didn\u2019t like that. Like I don\u2019t like it because I feel I don\u2019t give them enough and then I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess this sort of feels rather catastrophic.

I don\u2019t know. And after they left, Bryan came to talk to me. He said \u201cIt was fun.
