It might now that you have the Assyrian job. And I was especially sorry to lose a start student who was just beginning <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200831\">to establish himself in England. I wasn\u2019t clear that you had gone and I was asked many times by colleagues and the university authorities whether you were coming back, to which I generally replied that I thought you would be. And now here you are. I hope your return will be triumphant and that you will <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200832\">complete the Ph.D. I look forward in due course to seeing the script for your next book, and if the company likes it for publication to working with you on it.\u201d [4:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not\u2026 Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s nice.

Although that\u2019s not really true. I mean, he knows that each time the\u2026 well, there was just that one time I left because of money. And I tried to keep in touch with him. See, he\u2019s ignoring what I said about not getting funded. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Because he has nothing to say about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: But it sounds like he feels like you hadn\u2019t communicated that you were leaving.

I think he\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Because I even\u2026 like then when I left I would e-mail him, I would be like, \u201cSo what funding, what should I do?\u201d You know, \u201cI think I could stay here now and get this job.\u201d So it wasn\u2019t really\u2026 Yeah.

No, it\u2019s very nice. It\u2019s very nice, it\u2019s very nice. And I think\u2026 yeah. And like it\u2019s kind of not what I expected, but what I hoped. I mean, I\u2019d be really surprised if he was like, \u201cWell, yeah, I\u2019ve been pissed,\u201d you know.

But even those things, some of the reason that happened was because that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re\u2026 I mean, you don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">any money, you\u2019re stressed out, you\u2019re in a country you don\u2019t know anybody. It wasn\u2019t like I was just like so comfortable. Like I had that initial euphoria. But then when Meredith got there and it was shitty, and I realized the money was running out really, really fast, and I wasn\u2019t able to find a job. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B32\">That\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s hard to just like, \u201cOh, let me kick back and work on this anthology project.\u201d It just\u2026 Especially back then when that shit really\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: See, that\u2019s what I\u2026 I think now you would have responded to the whole thing differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Given what you\u2019ve done and what you\u2019ve been approaching, and just in grounding more in reality. Even when things are really stressful and hard, it would be a different set of communications that would happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And maybe something different would have evolved.

Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: That you really have potential and that\u2019s why I want you to be here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s not taking ownership of his part in that [unclear].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: Right. Right. But that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s okay. And that\u2019s really all I needed. I needed to let him know that, look man, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m\u2026 somehow forgotten, or there\u2019s some kind half-ass whatever. You know, there are circumstances out of my control that, yeah, of course I wish that they were different, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB1\">but they\u2019re not, and I can\u2019t apologize for that. I\u2019ve still made effort. Like I get in touch, I tried to get the funding. I even got back there with\u2026 I went through hell with my uncle bent backwards to make this thing happen, and I got back there. But then when I was there yet again I didn\u2019t get a teaching <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB2\">job. It\u2019s not like\u2026 You know, so I would have been happy to fucking stay, I didn\u2019t have a problem. I applied to universities while I was there.

My Assyrian isn\u2019t strong enough, there just aren\u2019t that many great Assyrian poets I guess.

[20:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: I mean, it\u2019s interesting that the idea of meeting me or meeting this or relying on this space becomes immediately a crutch, that it\u2019s a very\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: Well, no, no, I just mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">THERAPIST: \u2026 pejorative\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: Well, I just mean\u2026 well, in the past it was.

It\u2019d be good to be able to talk to Claire about this.\u201d But, you know, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201632\">a good feeling to be able to be like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m handling it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20162-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20162-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562562\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

Yeah, yeah. Yup. Yeah, that\u2019s exactly\u2026 that\u2019s exactly the feeling now. It\u2019s\u2026 Yeah.

Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s just not happening anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">THERAPIST: You can feel like you want to teach, you can feel like you want to stay for a woman, and you can feel in conflict about those things and be trying to sort of make an educated decision about what\u2019s the best for you in the long run, which is really different from only doing it from one call <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D11\">it a self-state, one self-state or another, and forgetting all the rest of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. Well, because also back then there was no big picture. Because it\u2019s like if you\u2019re in a constant state of anxiety and feeling like everything\u2019s going to end badly anyway\u2014subconsciously, you know what I mean\u2014then go all the way to fucking Edinburgh, what is that? Now that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D31\">not the case. Like, what do you mean what is that?

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And the same with UConn. You know, once\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what the fuck happens. I mean, once that\u2026 Although the thing with UConn is weirder, because I did get through all of it. I went to classes, I finished my papers on time. It must have been like a different kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E71\">of bubble, where because it was UConn and I felt so much comfort because it was my undergrad school I was able to\u2026 you know what I mean? Like everything\u2019s familiar, I just somehow\u2026 But then when it got to this final project I just don\u2019t know what happened. I like froze and I couldn\u2019t deal.

Like two years went by, I can\u2019t finish <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB1\">it now.

There were a couple times where I went and I paid the one thousand whatever, this fee, and it just didn\u2019t happen. And then of course that just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB2\">builds up. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m an idiot, I can\u2019t finish this fucking thing. What am I going to tell them now? It\u2019s embarrassing.
