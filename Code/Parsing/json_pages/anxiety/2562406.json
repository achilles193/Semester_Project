And I\u2019m not helping you to feel better. And also, our relationship is a source of confusion. (inaudible at 00:30:34) unclear. In some ways, I think you are very strong. You\u2019re missing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B71\">something, I\u2019m not doing something right. But then again, sometimes, you also get mad at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: Right.

Is it getting sunny over there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. A little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Okay. Did that (inaudible at 00:32:18)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess the memory that comes to my mind is somebody playing sports. I don\u2019t know if this would apply in softball, but I\u2019m thinking of soccer or probably football or I think track.  Without cleats in their shoes, like slipping or falling or not being able to start a turn fast enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF1\">or stop fast enough. And it just seems it\u2019s easier for everybody else to do all that stuff. Or everybody has an advantage. And if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing, it can be incredibly frustrating. Especially if, in a lot of other ways, it feels or looks like you have everything that everybody else <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF2\">has. Is it like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">CLIENT: Right. But I think it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know. It feels like a confident (ph) thing, where everyone else\u2014I don\u2019t know.  Not so extreme of I think them\u2014that someone\u2019s right, that they just believe in themselves or, I mean, I don\u2019t. I only look to a situation or a whim of\u2014I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on around me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">CLIENT: Guess there\u2019s no control or\u2014I don\u2019t know.

I guess I\u2019m not sure if you mean \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">CLIENT: Say there\u2019s a social interaction.

It\u2019s them.\u201d I\u2019m just going to wind up ruminating about it, where other people would\u2019ve been like, \u201cWell, I was tired.\u201d And let themself off the hook or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD1\">I don\u2019t know.

I mean, it\u2019s a little complicated, but I guess\u2014here\u2019s what I have in mind. And here\u2019s also I think it\u2019s working at this moment, between you and me. And this is not the way I really do, but it\u2019s a metaphor from graduate school. You know about IQ tests?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: And do you know about how they\u2019re\u2014how the \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT: Took a Instagram or (inaudible at 00:40:38) thing. The scores?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Right. There\u2019s that, but there\u2019s also\u2014so, the composite score, the overall composite score is made\u2014is in an aggregation of subtest scores. Unless they changed they changed it after grad (chuckles) school, but I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a verbal IQ and a performance IQ.  And each one of those <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF1\">is composed of two factors. So, verbal is verbal reasoning and I think\u2014let\u2019s see. There\u2019s verbal reasoning, there\u2019s processing speed. There\u2019s visual-spatial reasoning. And there\u2019s one other one that I\u2019m forgetting at the moment. (inaudible at 00:41:23) efficiency of processing or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">THERAPIST: And then, each of those are the aggregates of the individual subtest scores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">THERAPIST: So, there\u2019s this whole \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:41:36) you know about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">THERAPIST: But you don\u2019t report an overall score for an aggregate if the subscores are too disparate. So, if you\u2019re testing somebody with a non-verbal learning disability or something, and they have 140 verbal IQ and 95 performance IQ, you don\u2019t report the score as\u2014of 125 or whatever.  Because that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F1\">actually doesn\u2019t meaningfully what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: What you say is, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to report an overall score. The overall score doesn\u2019t really mean much,\u201d because what\u2019s really what\u2019s going on is there\u2019s these two very disparate scores and that\u2019s because of an underlying problem and blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">So, I\u2019m reminded of that because it\u2014I guess it seems to me that I think your experience is like that oftentimes, where you have these quite different and quite strong reactions to social situations. From different points of view or associate with different (inaudible at 00:43:03) about what\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201151\">on.  And that, I think, makes your experience feel pretty fragmented and leaves you without a single or a cohesive opinion or point of view of what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">THERAPIST: And yet, feeling a bunch of disparate things very intensely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">THERAPIST: And the way that I see us operating between you and me at the moment is that\u2014on one hand, I think you want to answer from me about what\u2019s going on or what you\u2019re missing.  Or what you can do to make things better. And yet, I think, at the same time, whatever I say tends to become another <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F1\">fragment.  I mean, sometimes, I\u2019m just wrong, and that\u2019s a different (chuckles) story. That\u2019s like it is what it is. But I think other times, it becomes another fragment that you then similarly have (inaudible at 00:45:18) reactions to. And that continues the same process.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562406\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: Couldn\u2019t be feeling any better than before.

Or elaborated or it seemed clear that hopefully I\u2019ve understood something about it, what you\u2019re describing or that\u2014I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201271\">that\u2019s helpful in a way, if it communicates that I\u2019m on the same page. But, again, I think maybe (inaudible at 00:46:30) response is a bit fragmented in that it also doesn\u2019t, then, give you an answer. So, I guess I\u2019m laying out what it seems to me you\u2019re struggling with or what\u2019s going on.
