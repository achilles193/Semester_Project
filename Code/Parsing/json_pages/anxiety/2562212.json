Like on one hand, it\u2019s good and [needs you to be] a little more open talking about, among other things, like what goes on between you and me and what that\u2019s like for you. At the same time, I think it exposes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D51\">you to more of the risks of sort of feeling thin-skinned or having reactions you\u2019re not happy to be having like being angry or feeling at fault.
