I just want it to be warm. Also, I think now when it comes to cold, it could be allergies. I feel like I\u2019ve been sick all winter. [1:00] Yeah, I guess I\u2019m kind of grumpy this morning. I\u2019m really tired. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">Even though I basically didn\u2019t do anything this weekend other than sleep. I did exactly what I wanted and needed to do which was sleep a lot and read a lot of books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I\u2019m still tired. [2:02] We ended up having to take our car to the shop. I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to look like. It seems just like a leak in brake fluid. I put some duct tape on it. [3:00] I feel like the system that we\u2019ve got set up for James basically with all the money is sort of a relief <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">to me, but also it\u2019s not very good for me. I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not great for my relationship with James and it makes me \u2013 it feels sort of powerless and helpless. And it\u2019s not good. But I also feel like maybe this minute is not the time to demand an overhaul of that. [4:00] Candace\u2019s coming to visit tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">I think University of Maryland has a summer program that she\u2019s going to show me when she\u2019s here, so that\u2019s one of the excuses to come up here. I don\u2019t remember what the program\u2019s in exactly or if it\u2019s leading to a degree or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: That would be cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. It would be awesome. She wrote to ask what I thought about whether she could visit BC without visiting Kirsten (sp) whether that would be bitchy. Kirsten was both my former roommate and Candace\u2019s former roommate. [5:13] I said, well, it might be a little bit. It sort of depends on how <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">much you want to avoid it versus how much you want to avoid Kirsten. But I don\u2019t know. And this friend is like, it just really brings out the mean streak in me. I find it very hard to be gracious about her, which is sort of weird and I\u2019m a little bit distressed about. I don\u2019t like being bitchy about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">people. (pause) I think I felt like when I was living with her, our relationship was basically predicated on me taking care of her and propping her up and sort of soothing her. [6:21] And I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I\u2019m sort of bitter about the fact that like, I\u2019m the one who like, had dropped out of grad school. And about the fact that like, when those roles would have been reversed, she just sort of left. And it doesn\u2019t make sense. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 because I don\u2019t actually want her to take care of me. She would be <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">terrible at that. I don\u2019t know. [7:14] (pause) It\u2019s like, I\u2019m jealous of her, even though I also like her. I don\u2019t think I have very much to be jealous of. (pause) I feel like when most people \u2013 most people have like, if they feel like they\u2019ve done something to me or just not been a good person or not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">somebody that I want to be with, I can just sort of let them lie. [8:33] Okay well, I guess we\u2019re done here and you go live your life and that will be fine and I\u2019ll go live my life and I won\u2019t have to deal with you. That\u2019ll be great. And she just sort of got under my skin. (pause) So I\u2019m going to cut <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">myself. It\u2019s hard. [9:30] It\u2019s really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know what to make of it. I\u2019ll start with the transition from your mentioning her getting under your skin and cutting yourself or not cutting yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562452\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: In terms of bad habits, that one is pretty symbolically fruitful, I think. (laughter) (pause) [10:30] (pause) When I do decide not to \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 something about the fact that I can just decide not to do this and then go through with it that I do have that power. [11:40] It doesn\u2019t make <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">me \u2013 it\u2019s not a good feeling to do that. I hear you. More like I feel like what\u2019s wrong with me that I don\u2019t \u2013 why then I cut myself so many times if I don\u2019t have to. (pause) [12:24] I was thinking about being suicidal when I was in the hospital. At one point I sort of sat up and went, you know, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">never actually going to try to kill myself. In terms of just a prediction, I\u2019m never going to do it. So the issue isn\u2019t really that like, whether or not that\u2019s going to happen. The issue is, how do I get to be okay with that. God, I hate that. (crying) (pause) [13:24] It\u2019s just something I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">to be different and it\u2019s never going to be different, but I have to deal with that and I don\u2019t know how. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re asking, how do you \u2013 how do you live with wanting that so much and with the pain that comes along with it. [14:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I\u2019m more thinking about the latter. It\u2019s so hard. But that\u2019s not a door open for me. (pause) [15:40] (pause) [16:34] My roommate was, she\u2019s probably in her 70s, maybe. Probably not older than mid to late 70s. I think her name is Becky. And she\u2019s very interesting. What she told <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">me was that she had multiple personality disorder. [17:31] and that she spent the last 30 years going through 13 manifestations to two, and that she\u2019s really excited about that. We just sort of talked a lot. And it was one of those things where I was like, well, I don\u2019t really know how reliable of a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">narrator you are, but it was really fun. So we got to be friends. I just asked her, how do you keep going? How do you do that? She just said, you just do. [18:24] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: How do you keep going when so many things hurt so much of the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [19:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Sometimes things that other people do are on the outside and sometimes the things you are doing to yourself. Hating yourself or hurting yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. It doesn\u2019t feel even as though it\u2019s things that are happening. It just feels like the way that things are if that makes sense. It\u2019s not -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s sort of a condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. [20:35] All my energy ends up going into trying to remember that isn\u2019t actually happening and it\u2019s not a condition. I got very upset in couples counseling yesterday toward the end. I was totally overwhelmed by feeling like I have ruined everything by having to be hospitalized again. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I could barely even talk, just because I was working so hard to remember that that way that I was feeling wasn\u2019t based on a real thing. [21:36] That it was not what the situation that was making me upset wasn\u2019t the same mess that I thought it was. It\u2019s really confusing and hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Like you felt so consumed by the sort of belief of situation in your mind that you had in fact, completely screwed everything up between you and James by having to be hospitalized. But just to keep your feet on the ground a little bit it took everything you had. [22:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562452\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, my God. I fucking hate St. Patrick\u2019s Day. It\u2019s the worst. It\u2019s the worst. I was trying to get to a lecture downtown on Sunday, and it was like the train was like, 20 minutes delayed, so I was going to be late anyway. And that was annoying to find. And then at one stop, I was trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">to get off at this like, there was already a fair number of drunk kids drinking, but also like, shouting and like, it seemed like there was going to be a fight. And was really tense about that. And then like, this horde of people poured on both sides and they wouldn\u2019t let me off at my stop. And so I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">was like, crushed in with a lot of people and there was lots and lots of shouting. It was like, really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">The people on the platform were like, pounding on the windows as we entered and left the stations. So at another stop, I had to wave my arms say, I have to get off, I have to get off. [23:27] You know, because they\u2019re actually all very nice people. They were like, let her off and sort of pushed me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">I eventually got off the train because a guy from outside took my arm and pulled me out like a cork out of a bottle. What the fuck? So that wasn\u2019t really what I needed on Sunday. I guess I thought of that, because it feels like this same situation where it felt like this terrifying, menacing situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">where it felt like people were attacking me. And, you know, just sort of having a good time and don\u2019t\u2019 give a shit about anybody else who might be in the way. [24:25] But it\u2019s still really scary. It wasn\u2019t even St. Patrick\u2019s Day. It was on Sunday. I mean, what the hell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: There was a funny Onion headline, I don\u2019t know if you say it. I mean like, Denver Mayor Throws out Ceremonial First Punch of St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade (inaudible at 24:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: I saw that, but I didn\u2019t read that it was from the Onion. I was just like, okay. Denver\u2019s weird. I can see that happening. [25:19] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I guess you feel like you\u2019re always getting hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes. Or besieged. (pause) [26:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s something that seems very dream-like almost about what you\u2019re describing from the train. It\u2019s the sort of thing that would sort of happen in a train.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was weird. \u2018Cause like, it wasn\u2019t that crowded and then people poured in. But I couldn\u2019t get off the train. There were people pounding on the sides of the train that was going by. Yeah, it was weird. [27:20] (pause) [28:20] [29:17] So I missed the lecture. So I just walked around downtown <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">until it felt like three hours, and to the church, which would have been nice, but it was too cold to actually sit outside. (pause) The other thing that sucks about this time of year is that I\u2019m sick of dressing for the weather. Every day I\u2019m like, well, maybe I won\u2019t need my warm boots. And then actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">I\u2019m wearing them. [31:10] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: You do a little more comfortable being able to talk about this stuff. I imagine it\u2019s partly from feeling a little relieved, among other things with what we were talking about yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: It sort of feels like a weight off. [32:18] (pause) [33:20] Which, surprisingly enough, doesn\u2019t make it easier to start talking about it again. (pause) I feel like you want me to do something or say something or go somewhere. I don\u2019t know what it is. And I\u2019m (inaudible at 34:02).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562452\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: I see things maybe as though what I just said relating to yesterday was like an invitation? [34:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Or, there was kind of an implication there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: I guess so, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: I was just laughing at I wonder if\u2026 I was thinking of different ways that you don\u2019t ask questions. Sorry. [35:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: I can imagine a few reasons why you feel that way. One of them is like, there\u2019s something dangerous or anxious about my saying like, hey, it seems a little bit easier for you today to say how some things are pissing you off. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s how there\u2019s like, a little more room for that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">or you seem more at ease that way. That\u2019s sort of a scary thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: That makes sense. [36:27] Covering my tracks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah. In some way you feel like, hemmed in or sort of pushed in some direction you don\u2019t want to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: That makes sense. \u2018Cause I mean, after you started to talk I was \u2013 I\u2019m \u2013 It feels like I\u2019m saying that I\u2019m pissed off because I was too tired not to. (inaudible due to simultaneous dialogue at 37:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: If you just weren\u2019t so damn tired and were in better control of yourself, you\u2019d never be talking this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 37:22) [37:30] (pause) Yeah. I guess you sort of called attention to it, and that sort of made me feel like, oh yeah, I guess I have been pretty negative today and I feel bad about that. [38:31] (pause) [39:30] Yeah. There\u2019s something that\u2019s not okay with it. (pause) [40:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You feel like you\u2019ve done something pretty wrong if you \u2013 it feels more (inaudible at 41:16)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, when other people do that they eventually feel like they\u2019re sort of giving the all of their bad feelings for me to carry. And I don\u2019t like feeling like I\u2019m doing that. [42:08] I guess also, it feels like along with a sort of low-level grumbling is not actually that important. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">feels like it doesn\u2019t help me to sort of dump that on you, because that\u2019s not the thing that I actually want to be dumping. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: And useless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: I wondered if it felt \u2013 I\u2019m wondering again, apparently. I wonder if it felt to you like I was sort of calling you on what you\u2019re doing and flipping it. I mean, I don\u2019t think you actually believe that is what I was doing. But if I was pointing at and bringing it yesterday and all of a sudden <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">you\u2019re feeling that I\u2019m burdening you with something. . I have an expectation or I\u2019m sort of pushing you in a way. [43:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It sort of felt like you were saying \u2013 it felt like an invitation to talk about something else, which felt like an invitation not to keep talking about what we were talking about, also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: I see. So not so much retaliatory as just, don\u2019t do that anymore, let\u2019s do this other thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so. [44:30] (pause) Which sometimes is very welcome, but this time it was not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: In a similar way, it feels like there are times when I\u2019m pointing towards something else, or saying, hey, let\u2019s don\u2019t talk about that, let\u2019s talk about this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. [45:30] More like a hey, this door is here, more than anything else. And sometimes I need that push to say like yes, I do want to talk about something. But I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562452\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
