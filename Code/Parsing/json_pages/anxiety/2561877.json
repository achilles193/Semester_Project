Certainly I\u2019m not going to edit it or change it, so I started to wonder what felt useful to you about having me read it. I know that I\u2019ve offered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I think you\u2019ve read most of it before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: When you say that you felt like a voyeur, what do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a very personal letter from you to your dad and none of the information is really new to me. As you\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve read most of that letter before and we\u2019ve talked about all of the things that you talk about in the letter. They are things we\u2019ve really talked about at length, so it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">that it was information that I felt that I shouldn\u2019t be privy to. But it was your direct communication to him, so I guess that\u2019s the part that felt like these were really the things that Bryce wants to talk to his dad about, not the things he wants to talk to me about.  They are a lot of the same things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">but . . . (both laugh) Not the content, but the delivery. This is sort of a private thing that maybe I shouldn\u2019t be . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: No, at this point I was kind of desperate. I needed to get this thing out and I need to get past this and see what can be done as a result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve been holding onto it for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) This week has been hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: This week in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It had nothing to do with that letter necessarily, but the part that I wrote about, self-destructive behavior, is something that I wrote yesterday.  I really struggle with how to not engage in that. It\u2019s a problem for me. I\u2019m not going to try to make excuses, but this week there is a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">going on. I had a colonoscopy on Monday. I am now down to two drugs instead of three as of Monday. Yesterday I dropped Julie off at her work appointment that went from 10:00 until 4:00. On the way home, I drove past three different massage places and didn\u2019t stop \u2013 and I said to myself, \u201cYou know, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">really do have control over feeling bad or not. You really do have control over this.\u201d  It\u2019s a choice. You either decide to feel good about creating the life you want to live or you can succumb to the cheap and easy, but damaging. I got home and I was thrilled. I was thrilled that I didn\u2019t stop. Last <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">night when I went to the gym, I stopped by this new place that was advertising and the woman spoke two or three words of English and at the half appointment I flipped over and I had an erection.  She proceeded to massage my chest. She uncovered my genitals and kind of nodded, like \u201cis that okay?\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F4\">thought she was just uncovering me because some places that I\u2019ve been to I have been uncovered, basically. Well, I\u2019m not about to say that I had no idea what she was going to do, but then she then proceeded to give me a hand job and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt lower since Mexico. (pause)  What bothers me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F5\">the most, I think, is that I don\u2019t seem like I can control thinking about it or doing it. I can feel horrible afterwards. I can say, \u201cThis has got to stop.\u201d I can say, \u201cYou know . . .\u201d all sorts of things, but the behavior hasn\u2019t changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Not every time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561877\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: No, you\u2019re right; and that\u2019s the one thing, I think, that I was clinging to yesterday was that I can\u2019t beat myself up over this because I did manage to live the way I wanted to (sniggers) one part of the day and not the other part of the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: You said you drove by three places, so there were three times when you made the decision to somehow stop yourself from pursuing what feels like the cheap-and-easy, short-term solution; and one time when you didn\u2019t.  What was the difference? What allowed you to drive by the first three times <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">and not the last?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s what I was trying to figure out because I was going to the gym and I did go to the gym, but that\u2019s why setting out to do something that\u2019s good for me isn\u2019t always free from diversions or downplaying the . . . Because I said to myself, \u201cMaybe you should go to the gym first and see <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">how you feel afterwards. Maybe you won\u2019t feel like you even want to do this.\u201d  That went in one ear and out the other. (pause) I don\u2019t know what to do. I understand that my even going there and doing that is almost a microcosm of my whole life. Am I that person? Am I going to be basing myself solely <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">on the person who went and got that erotic massage? I could do that and feel horrible. Sure. (sniggers) I did that very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want to feel horrible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t. (pause) But it\u2019s almost like how sorry am I really? I know that enters into judging. The first time I walked in here and talked about this I was coaxed into masturbating on the table. This time it was out of my hands. It was in my control but \u2013 you know. I fear that I\u2019m going to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">lured is such an irresponsible word. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I think the fear is that you\u2019re going to be put in a position where it\u2019s really hard to say no because that\u2019s what\u2019s really happening, right? You could say no. You could flip over. You could leave, but it\u2019s really hard once you\u2019re that far down the path to do that, right? There is debate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">in the literature. There is not enough research to know whether or not there is really such a thing as a sex addiction or a pornography addiction. That realm really hasn\u2019t been studied enough and some people say it\u2019s like an addiction and other studies say it\u2019s totally different when you look at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">brain chemistry. Regardless, we don\u2019t know, but when you\u2019re in a scenario where \u2013 you said am I sorry enough to not do it again? You have to look at how strong are the urges?  Yes, I do think you do truly feel badly and, like you said, afterwards there is not a time that you felt lower other than Mexico. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">I don\u2019t doubt how badly you feel, but I also don\u2019t doubt that the urge is really, really strong to escape from what the feeling is just before. I think the reason you go into the massage parlor is that you feel really badly and you want to feel something else. Then when someone provides you an opportunity <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">to feel better really quickly, soon, that\u2019s really hard to say no to and it\u2019s really hard to keep in mind that the good feeling is going to be short-lived. It\u2019s very, very hard to keep that in mind in the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: How did you stop drinking? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: How did I stop drinking? (chuckles) Guilt and shame, I guess, were working pretty hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561877\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Did you continue to go to bars and order drinks and expect yourself not to drink them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: No. However I did purchase beer for guests and had it in the fridge for months without even a hint of interest in it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: So the interest went away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I know what you\u2019re getting at and I think the comparison to alcohol is pertinent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not perfect because of the fact that your interest in alcohol went away. Your interest in sex is not going to go away because you\u2019re a human being. That\u2019s partly why the addiction model is debatable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m addicted to feeling better about myself (chuckles) and the means to satisfy that are variable \u2013 or I should say varied.  (pause) I don\u2019t know. (sighs) (pause) I don\u2019t know how I am unable to come up with ways or a way of thinking about things that I know are good for me as being the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">to go to first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Did anybody know how badly you felt that day, before or after?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Which day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think you gave me a particular day, but the day that you drove by the three places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: This was yesterday. No.  (pause) Why do you ask?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you had called to somebody, talked to somebody, let them know what you were feeling before you tried to fix it yourself. What if you had invited somebody else to . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Before I went to that one? (pause) Actually talked about how I\u2019m feeling or . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Pieces of it or \u201cI\u2019m having a really bad day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: The thing is I don\u2019t think I was having a bad day. I don\u2019t know.  I was keeping myself busy at home, doing laundry, really staying busy, and I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is that is so dampening. (pause) Maybe it is the change in medication. I don\u2019t know, but . . . (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like your mood has been worse since you\u2019ve started decreasing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: No, my mood has been kind of highs and lows. For the first time, I think it was yesterday or the day before, where I actually felt like I could live the life I want to live. (pause) And as excited as I was, I don\u2019t know . . . I don\u2019t know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What happened to that feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: It\u2019s still there. It\u2019s just (pause) . . . It just feels saddled with the things that aren\u2019t a part of living [well] (ph?). (sighs) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: How does this fit into getting that letter finally out of your house and into dad\u2019s mailbox? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well, I thought that if I could get this thing off my chest it would be one less thing that I avoid doing. It\u2019s not like this has taken four years because of careful analysis.  It\u2019s been disinterest or avoidance or laziness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Not wanting to hurt dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: There is that, too, but not wanting to hurt dad and not sure if it would actually help me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: But it does sound like now at least one piece would be helpful. Sending it doesn\u2019t allow you to reinforce that idea of you being someone who doesn\u2019t finish things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (pause)  Part of it is just desperation, hoping that something can turn as a result.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: So how does that fit into ways you want your life to be?

That is difficult to reconcile (pause) with \u2013 I don\u2019t know what \u2013 being satisfied with my life in such a way that I\u2019m not prone to wander? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I want to be clear that I\u2019m not shaming you, but I think what happens in here parallels what happens out there and the same ways of wanting to avoid what you\u2019re feeling happen in here and happen out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So if I\u2019m understanding what you\u2019re saying, if I could identify what I\u2019m avoiding here it would help me live the life I want to live out there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because the life, the patterns that you have in here can\u2019t be totally different than what happens out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not.

It\u2019s not about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: I assume you don\u2019t but . . . (sniggers) (pause)  Yeah. At this point, I have a hard time trying to figure out what it is that I\u2019m trying to avoid because I can\u2019t figure it out when I\u2019m driving around. (sighs) There is some sort of deficiency. Some needs are not being met.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Well you really need to feel good about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: The need to feel emotionally and intimately connected with your wife. I just picked two things that we\u2019ve talked about recently that feel like unmet needs. Those are both pretty near the top.

I don\u2019t know what emotional purpose it serves. I understand the physical, but the emotional \u2013 intellectual, if there is one \u2013 is lost on me at this point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t know what it is for for you?

What stories did you hear about sex growing up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I was sort of filled in by my siblings, my older brothers, and it wasn\u2019t the most [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:03) and wholesome [ ] I think that others might have. In a way it was kind of raunchy, but to say \u201ctold\u201d or \u201ctaught\u201d would be a stretch.  (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Exposed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Perhaps. (scoffs) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: So what did you make of what you were exposed to? What ideas did you . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Sex was about just (pause) getting off and the beauty of sex never entered into it.  We may have talked about this, but have you seen that movie Don Juan or whatever?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: I have not seen the whole thing. (both chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Which part of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: I saw an interview about it so I know the premise, but I haven\u2019t seen the film.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a fascinating perspective on going from a one-night-stand kind of guy but who is also addicted to porn \u2013 somebody who finds actual meaning and depth with one person \u2013 who isn\u2019t a real likely subject.  (pause) I just don\u2019t know what . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Is that what you\u2019re hoping for for yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m hoping for something in what it is currently. I don\u2019t know how to approach it. Talking about it just seems so impractical, uninteresting. (sighs) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561877\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Why do you want it to be something different than what it is for you right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right now it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s often just routine and going through the motions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re talking about having sex with your wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: But it doesn\u2019t necessarily feel nothing or routine if you\u2019re masturbating watching porn or if you go to one of these places. I think that we have to encompass all of that in what sex actually is for you and I think also the fantasies that you have. It\u2019s interesting that when you think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">sex, you\u2019re thinking about intercourse with your wife and you leave off all these other ways that you express your sexual interest and appetite.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well, because I guess I had hoped that if sex with my wife were more fulfilling that an emotional connection with her would be more present and my tendency to seek attention or whatever it is \u2013 touch \u2013 elsewhere would be [ended] (ph?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Not likely the case, but it seems like you have to acknowledge that that other need and desire is there. If you can\u2019t find a way to bridge that with your wife, then it\u2019s going to continue to feel like you need to seek it out elsewhere. Somehow we have to sort of bridge those two together <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">and I don\u2019t know how they got so separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know (pause) when or how that happened and I don\u2019t know (pause) . . . It\u2019s been a long time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: The dichotomy of the excitement that you can experience elsewhere and the lack of emotion and interest that you have in what you consider sex with your wife, that dichotomy is really strong and interesting. It\u2019s sort of like the Virgin Mary and the whore. How did it get so separate? It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">one person. What if you didn\u2019t have to split things apart so much? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause)  I don\u2019t know. Can you speak some more about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: The dichotomy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: About putting them back together. I don\u2019t . . . (pause) I don\u2019t know how to do that. I don\u2019t know what that would look like. I don\u2019t know how to be asking my wife to . . . (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s the concept of just broadening the scope so that what feels appropriate or okay somehow gets expanded because if what you\u2019re feeling, if what\u2019s happening is completely unsatisfying \u2013 and maybe it\u2019s not just in terms of rote behavior, but also just the ideas and concepts you hold of what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">sex with your marital partner is supposed to be. That\u2019s unfulfilling to you and maybe partly that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t match with what felt exciting as a kid growing up or what feels exciting now. If that\u2019s split off, exciting sex is something that you can\u2019t have with your wife, why in earth would you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B92\">want to be limited in that way? But if there is a strong dichotomy of what feels \u2013 you can take religion out of it \u2013 the concept of there are girls you date and then there is the girl you marry, why would those be so different?  That\u2019s setting yourself up to be miserable and bored. I think maybe it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B93\">just part of that idea of being able to have a broader concept that brings together the exciting dating elicit phase with what actual married sex can feel like, too.

I think I\u2019m just as guilty as my wife is as far as not changing things up because when I\u2019ve tried, it\u2019s been rebuffed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Do you know why it\u2019s been rebuffed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, and (pause) I understand that. But I think for her I get the impression that being inside her wall should be enough and that\u2019s what the breakdown is, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So you guys have different beliefs about what should feel satisfying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. She has had \u2013 at least she always has had for me \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean to say this as though she\u2019s horrible because of this, that and the other thing; that\u2019s not what I mean to say. But if that\u2019s her way of thinking, that it should be just enough to be inside her, what am I missing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So are you saying that she\u2019s right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: No. But if she is getting some sort of satisfaction, basic emotional connection out of that, how do I do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: You might not be the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: I believe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I also believe that. (both chuckle)  But I don\u2019t know how to even talk about it. Well, Jean, how do we make this so that it\u2019s also exciting and satisfying for me because it\u2019s not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I think you get to say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: And stay married? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: We might need to finesse the delivery a little bit. What you\u2019re basically saying is that you have a wish and an expectation that sex should be satisfying for both of you. I don\u2019t think saying that is a divorce-able offense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And your wish \u201cI would like for our sex lives to be better for both of us\u201d is a perfectly fine and admirable wish. Saying \u201cit\u2019s been completely unsatisfying for the past however-many years and I would like it to be different,\u201d that\u2019s going to be hard for her to work with.  But \u201cI want you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">to know that it could be better for both of us; could we talk about some things we could try to have that happen?\u201d I think the conversation includes not just tricks, necessarily in the bedroom, but there may be things that could be changed that have nothing to do with actual intercourse that would make <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D92\">it feel more varied, make it feel more interesting and exciting, make you actually feel like she\u2019s more invested in making sure that you are actually enjoying the experience, which I think is a big piece of why you\u2019re not. It\u2019s because you don\u2019t feel like she is invested in that. You feel like she thinks <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D93\">that you should just get okay with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: When you say things that don\u2019t \u2013 give me an example of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Being able to talk about intimacy together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Oh. (chuckles) Okay.(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: It could be that but it could also be setting the stage earlier. Talking to each other about things that feel erotic or sexual during the day, not necessarily getting to bed at night. Like you said, you\u2019re exhausted at night, but that\u2019s when she feels most interested, and saying like \u201chey, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">you want sex?\u201d There may be better ways of getting you both on the same page or just bringing sexuality into other parts of your day or experience together. You\u2019ve talked about watching porn. That might be something. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s open to doing that with you. There may be other ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561877\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: (sniggers) I\u2019m not going to ask her that, but I take your point. (pause)  This is all sitting right next to the act, the belief that I have that she is using sex to feel good about herself. You\u2019re absolutely right. I think these things are important to cultivate, but I think any mention of sex <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">or dissatisfaction must be couched in language that is very careful so as not to inflame that belief of hers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Focusing on the positive, wanting it to be better rather than saying \u201cit\u2019s not good.\u201d And maybe also having some conversations about what do you want sex to be in your marriage. You don\u2019t really want it to be only a tool for her to feel good about herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: Okay. I\u2019m not asking you about you, but what do other people, what are other ideas about what sex is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I think you could probably get ideas from reading books, watching movies. What is it sold as?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s sold as something that I think is completely fraudulent. I don\u2019t necessarily believe in much of the narratives that sex gets passed off as. I believe that there are possibilities within those perhaps, but I don\u2019t believe in any of the popular ideas about sex. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay. I think where the conversation starts is that the two of you need to decide what you want it to be. It\u2019s not any one thing. There aren\u2019t any answers to your question. Is it the Disney princess gets saved by the prince and they go off happily ever after? We don\u2019t actually see <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">any sex, but we know that they are going to be safe forever because they fell in love and we go on to imagine what happens next. That may not be realistic, but you\u2019re allowed to hold ideas about it. I think what\u2019s really important is you figuring out what do you believe it can be? What do you want it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED2\">to be, whether it can be that or not? And what does she believe? You don\u2019t necessarily have to have the same ideas, but you guys need to know what each other\u2019s ideas are, since part of your belief is that \u2013 and you\u2019ve told me this before \u2013 you\u2019re only supposed to be having sex with her.  So it makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED3\">it important for you guys to be okay with what are the expectations that you both have or what are the hopes of what it could mean? Is it okay for it to be kind of raunchy and just about getting off? Do you want it to be about that sometimes but something else another time? Is it okay with her that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED4\">that\u2019s your belief? These are all things that actually would behoove you to be able to talk about. A nauseating concept, it looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">CLIENT: (sniggers) Yeah. It is, just because I think her ideas of sex are so \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say Puritanical \u2013 but very traditional.  I\u2019m not even sure where to plug into that or how to broaden it. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Maybe a good place to start is to ask if she would be okay with maybe broadening her view, just talking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: (sniggers) And if she says no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Well if she\u2019s not open to talking about stuff, that\u2019s probably a couple\u2019s therapy issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Because you can\u2019t change things without at least being able to talk about what are the hesitancies? What are the fears? What are the limits? What\u2019s making it scary to even consider other things? We do need to stop for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: All right.
