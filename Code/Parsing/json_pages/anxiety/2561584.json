Yeah I definitely. I\u2019m trying to think of a word I cannot find. It\u2019s so weird for like a week now I feel like there\u2019s a word I\u2019m trying to think of to describe how I\u2019m feeling. Not deflated, defeated, just I cannot its weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Discouraged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Discouraged something yeah, I\u2019m just like Something like Friday I went out to have a drink with my friend Matthew and my friend Isabella. It was just, it was funny. I mean in a way the whole bar was symbolic. Maybe there\u2019s just a mood out there like the bar was kind of empty. It was unusually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">kind of empty. Everything just seemed blah, like the rest of the crowd kind of seemed blah. I had like one beer, two, I was like I did not even feel like drinking. Wasn\u2019t sitting well with, I wasn\u2019t feeling good. Since I started feeling kind of nauseous on Friday. I felt like I was having trouble making <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">conversation. And since them I\u2019m just like. It\u2019s been. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t know like, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what to say anymore about these things, you know what I mean? It could be it\u2019s like it\u2019s now getting into the dead of winter, and it\u2019s just cold, and on top of everything else I\u2019m just exhausted. I don\u2019t know, I feel very lethargic. I have just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">been feeling really tired. I have been sleeping a lot. At 1 minute I feel like I\u2019m gonna be fucked for the rest of my life, and the next minute I feel kind of hopeful. Like it\u2019s just this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What is this, fucked for the rest of my life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I just feel like. I mean I feel like, you know. That I have to get used to the fact that like this is it, you know. And that like coming here, I mean this is great, and it\u2019s good that I\u2019m working on things. But I think I have hit a wall with myself. Where it\u2019s like dude you\u2019re either doing shit <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">or you\u2019re not, and you know you\u2019re not 20. You\u2019re not even 30. So you either are writing your book or whatever these things are that you have hopes for. Or you are just not. And if you\u2019re not you\u2019ve just got to make peace. You\u2019ve gotta be just like you know what? Maybe I just want to sit around and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">watch Netflix all day, and I just don\u2019t care anymore, or I don\u2019t care right now or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Like I can\u2019t you know. So I\u2019m having trouble psychologically, you know it\u2019 not working with me anymore. No man you\u2019ve gotta give yourself a break, and. I mean I am giving myself a, I mean it\u2019s hard to explain. Like not that I should be whipping myself all day. But I just feel like if there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">these things I have hopes for, I\u2019m either diligent, not just half-assed, but diligently working to make these things happen or I\u2019m not. So that\u2019s you know that\u2019s a pretty big you know. Now the flip side of that is. I mean I\u2019m kind of am. I mean I\u2019m recording an EP, right? So I am diligently working, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">you know. So the flip side is I also have to be able to give myself a break in terms of not comparing or not. Yes I wished I worked on this EP when I was 25 or, you know what I mean? But I am doing it, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Or too separate working on something with monetary or validation from others or I don\u2019t know. So there\u2019s 2 different kinds of, on one hand I feel like you\u2019re either doing it or you\u2019re not, and that\u2019s I\u2019m getting a little tired of making excuses to myself. On the other hand it\u2019s like this, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">know what I mean? It\u2019s a weird combo of like I kind of need to be a little harder on myself. But in a certain way, and not in other ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561584\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: And not as hard on yourself in other ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right! So that\u2019s kind of not easy, but. So there\u2019s that. I feel lonelier than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. I think that\u2019s also what\u2019s happening. I just feel really lonely, like melancholically just, you know. And that\u2019s depressing me. I\u2019m like so what am I doing? I\u2019m talking to this chick in Armenia, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">what does that mean? I\u2019m gonna go there and she\u2019s probably not gonna be someone I want. I mean I can\u2019t, that\u2019s really just depressing me, I can\u2019t even, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s just really, really making. Maybe more than anything that\u2019s really making me feel whatever that word is that I\u2019m looking for, defeated, or de-. Like yeah, or like this is it. Like I can\u2019t even find, and whoever I have hooked up with. Either I have just immediately, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">know just hook up and I don\u2019t want to see them again, Or the 1 or 2 times I kind of want to see someone again, they don\u2019t want to see me. So it\u2019s like what is happening? Like just. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] leading up to how much loneliness there\u2019s always been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: All along when there aren\u2019t as many sort of surface exciting, impulsive fillers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Right? Like masturbating [inaudible] the peaks and valleys and when you start taking some of that away and you come back to ordinary life. And your ordinary baseline state has been a tremendous amount of loneliness, even in your own family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. No there\u2019s no doubt I think that\u2019s what it is.

See that\u2019s the thing. Like I go down to see my Mom. I take, and I just can\u2019t talk. I literally I\u2019m just like. In those moments I\u2019m just like what the fuck am I doing here? You know? Or I don\u2019t know if I think that, I just. She\u2019ll just be talking about some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">bullshit thing, and she knows that. I mean my mom is not stupid.

I mean I can\u2019t with someone who you know is not quite gonna get it, or feel defensive or whatever the fuck she\u2019s gonna feel. It\u2019s just. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: For someone who is not [inaudible] recognizing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, she just does not. Yeah. It\u2019s like she wants me to be well, but she doesn\u2019t understand or wan to understand the reasons I might not be feeling so great at different times, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: What do you get when a critical and anxious paranoia. It\u2019s your.

Like kind of cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561584\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Which and now take that and imagine it in the whole family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: In the whole family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: They do it to each other, they do it to themselves.

But it\u2019s so like you know another way like when I say Claire looks bad, and you think that\u2019s really, really horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well she did it like 2 nights ago. I got home, and I was kind of in a good mood you know. I was excited; I kind of get excited to see her get excited when Cecelia comes down. She gets so; it\u2019s just great to see my mom like that. She just loves this critter so much, you know. And I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">see that brings her joy, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: So I get kind of excited to just watch that, whatever. I come and I sit down. I\u2019m okay. And like she says oh you know. She reads a lot of like health books about like roots, and vegetables, and herbs, and that\u2019s great. She\u2019s like you know son I was reading the thing and they were talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">natural things you can do for redness in the face you know? Now you know it\u2019s like dude I\u2019m sitting here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. She doesn\u2019t you know, she doesn\u2019t mean it, but it doesn\u2019t matter whether she means it or not, it\u2019s just they can\u2019t help but do that to themselves to other people, to anyone in the family. Like my aunt telling my grandmother, the woman has dementia. She\u2019s 90. You know just telling her like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">you know. Oh man you wanna tell this to your psychologist friends. They were laughing, mostly my aunt, but my mom too that supposedly my grandmother\u2019s nose is getting longer. Its changing shape, and they were kind of making fun of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Oh my God. (chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: You know it\u2019s like a 90 -year-old woman sitting there with dementia dude, what the? Are you kidding? I was like well, you know that\u2019s you know that as you get older your ears and your nose they do kind of change because it\u2019s gravity, and you know. But it was just so like. So that\u2019s what we are <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">talking about. Forget about me. Like that\u2019s their mother. That\u2019s a 90 -year-old old, ill woman and that\u2019s what they have to point out, you know? So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s the part of the joy of watching her greet Cecelia is like she can feel [inaudible] she never [inaudible] towards you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: No. Yeah no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Like madly in love, like not<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: But wait, but wait, wait, wait, but she does.

She makes a big thing about like when there are other people around; she wants people to know that Cecelia has very blue eyes. But that she\u2019ll be like I don\u2019t know, at night they\u2019re dark, but you should see they\u2019re so. Yet she wants people to know this cat has blue eyes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">They\u2019re very blue. I\u2019m like mom; you know they\u2019re always blue. I mean who cares, but it\u2019s just like what are you even saying? So like they literally change color at a certain hour? They\u2019re just blue. Sometimes it\u2019s dark out and they are darker. It\u2019s a cat you know what I mean? Or she\u2019ll be like is her <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">face kind of dirty? It looks darker than usual. Or I don\u2019t know, to the cat.

If I\u2019m not careful I\u2019ll watch a movie, and in the movie I\u2019ll go to these places about these people, and these characters, and life and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">you know. You know what I mean? If I\u2019m not careful I\u2019ll project her idiotic world view you know. So yeah, I don\u2019t know. So I think all these things. Like I\u2019m just hitting a bit of a wall where it\u2019s like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah I don\u2019t know what to do. Yeah I just don\u2019t know what to do. Like Uma, that was another one. There was the divinity girl, then this other girl, then Uma, the one that had sex with the guy. Like there has been like 4 women in the last like week that, I\u2019m not even madly in love with any of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">them, but it\u2019s just been a weird. It\u2019s almost like cosmically it just happened to synch up with the week where I\u2019m just feeling shitty about unemployment, and just like. And Uma was like you know I can\u2019t do this. You know you\u2019re like a. I mean it\u2019s not a bad thing. She was basically saying like I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">this feeling I\u2019m having, which is I\u2019m kind of falling in love, and it freaks me out. But I also know that<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: This is Uma from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Delaware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Delaware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know how to respond. It\u2019s like I\u2019m so, I don\u2019t even know anymore what I\u2019m doing, you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: So she said she\u2019s kind of falling in love?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: She\u2019s like I can\u2019t continue to pursue you because it\u2019s just hurtful, like it\u2019s just really painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s really into you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s like distance wise I have really, really strong feelings, and but it is what it is. I can\u2019t make you you know, whatever. But what I\u2019m saying is like I don\u2019t even know how to react really to that. I was like, oh I\u2019m sad or whatever. Was I sad? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m more numb, you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">what I mean? Because I can\u2019t even tell anymore, like this has fucked me up so much that which one is worth pursuing? I don\u2019t even know. You know what I mean? So. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: And now that I\u2019m so lucid about these things right? I\u2019m just not sure anymore which, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] has also hasn\u2019t been wounded to feel like, to know which relationship is right. You\u2019ll moan and [inaudible] not have to suffer.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561584\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: You know? Like that\u2019s a I said to you before like. The few times I said that you looked sad, and you look horrified like that\u2019s a bad thing that I would be saying that, as if that\u2019s a weakness or something being pointed out. Or like there\u2019s something wrong with you, instead of that being <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">something that could feel good. Like Oh someone gets it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s like someone sees me, someone knows me. It\u2019s safe to feel happier. You\u2019re so prepared all the time for someone to view something in you that\u2019s not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So how in a way could you know even, which of these women is a place that you could be at home, and feels comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Right. But you see that\u2019s the problem. Like what do you do with that information? That\u2019s really depressing because like well the months are flying by, and what I\u2019m gonna wait until I kind of figure that out, and settle down with someone when I\u2019m like 51? You know what I mean? And that\u2019s one, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">and two recognizing that fact just it\u2019s like an avalanche of partial regret but just an avalanche of all these past relationships, you know? Which I have found in the last week I\u2019ve been really yearning. I want to reach out to Kelly. I wanna, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: I know that\u2019s not good. That\u2019s not, like I know what that is, you know what I mean? I just feel really lonely and this and that, and (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: What did you suffer through, when she said that to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: She\u2019s great. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in love with her, you know? I think she\u2019s awesome, but see that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. In some ways why shouldn\u2019t I be in, you know what I mean? She\u2019s pretty. She\u2019s into a lot of the same things I\u2019m into. She really likes, like she really cares about who I am, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">wants me to be happy, and like. So like why don\u2019t I?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Why you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. I think that. I mean I worry a little bit that it\u2019s because of that. That she is so open and so loving that remember I think we talked about that one time. That is almost like a turnoff in a way. You know? So <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: But then there are also. I mean some of it is just realistic. I mean I don\u2019t have two nickels to rub together to. I mean, you know I mean I\u2019m really broke. So what\u2019s that? What she\u2019s just gonna drive up here every weekend? That\u2019s great, but that only makes me feel kind of guilt and like we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">keeping tabs like well it\u2019s only fair like I should be going. I don\u2019t feel like it. I can barely get outta bed, like I.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Unless she was here then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Well if she were here it wouldn\u2019t be this dramatic. You know what I mean? She would be a girl I was hanging out with, and we would have function, and you know what I mean? I\u2019d just see what happens, you know what I mean? It wouldn\u2019t be it wouldn\u2019t have to be all this thinking about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: But yeah. I mean even if she were here I don\u2019t know, you know. There are just too many layers, I think. This is the problem that\u2019s just making me feel really deflated about this. The shit with my family, and my mom, all that. Then the past relationship stuff, and all that. Not having any money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">But then also I don\u2019t know how real this Assyrian thing is. You know? Like it\u2019s just. So it makes it pretty much impossible for me to do anything. (pause) Speaking of which. So I last night, or whenever, it was like 4 in the morning whenever it was. I spoke on the phone with the English department. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B92\">I\u2019m still not entirely sure why I can\u2019t get an official offer. But it turns out that\u2019s kind of the way they do it for most, most people who are not hired as full time, you know what I mean? Adjuncts, other people like that, lecturers, whatever. This is how they do it. And she\u2019s just like the Dean is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B93\">a lawyer, and he is very paranoid about like you know if we offer you a thing, and you are not here. We offer it, we\u2019re kind of committing, and then if at the last minute you decide you\u2019re not gonna come we\u2019ve really allocated, and now you\u2019re not coming. Just some of that, you know? That being said. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B94\">I think I get that, I think I get that. That being said, she was like you know I mean, basically between you and me you should come here. There are plenty of courses. We would probably start you off with at least 1 but probably 2 courses. They pay double what they. They pay like $4,300 a course, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B95\">is not what I expected at all. So I\u2019m mean 2 courses, that\u2019s what I thought 4 courses was gonna be. 2 courses, I looked up the rents, $500 bucks for a pretty nice apartment in the city center. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561584\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: She\u2019s like and she\u2019s like other than that there\u2019s just plenty, once you are here. She\u2019s like there are just a lot of opportunities for someone like you. She\u2019s like if you come earlier there might be some summer classes. She\u2019s like those don\u2019t pay as much, but you could do that. There\u2019s lots <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">of tutoring. There\u2019s just, she\u2019s just like there\u2019s a lot of stuff to do. And then she\u2019s like you know so like in the Fall you know I think like expository writing, but then she told me. She\u2019s like in the long term we have plans for creative writing, for Literature, and that kind of was my thinking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB2\">that once I\u2019m there at the early stages. I mean they don\u2019t even know me. Once I got there and they know me, and blah, blah, blah. That could be my thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: So I basically told her I said yeah, I mean, and then I tried to kind of, because I cannot get anything in writing. I kept trying to like if I commit then I\u2019m at least gonna teach. I mean I\u2019m coming there to teach. I\u2019m not coming for these other peripheral jobs. You know? So it\u2019s something I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">still want to clarify, but it\u2019s pretty clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Like even finding out what she would say about by when you needed to be there, and you could be pretty sure of guaranteeing at least 1 open course in September. You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well she\u2019s like you know obviously, you know. I wouldn\u2019t go there in August. Because yeah again it\u2019s about them knowing that you\u2019re here. Okay so we can know. So in her mind she\u2019s like just let me know when you\u2019re gonna be here. We can start straight away, like there\u2019s plenty to do, even before <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">the summer if you get here. So what I told<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: In other words at the very minimum to be there before the summer in order to guarantee something in the fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: During the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: During the summer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: During the summer, yeah. Because what I told here was I was like by the time. I did not want to tell her that I am broke, but, you know. And it\u2019s a big deal, I mean for example what am I gonna do with Cecelia? That\u2019s I mean, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I could leave her here. That\u2019s, I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">never had a connection like this with anything so, you know what I mean? I might have to take her with. I mean it\u2019s a long journey but. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561584\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: I mean leave her with whom? My Mom and a bunch of nut jobs, and have my grandmother accidentally throw her something that she is gonna choke on? I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t. I worry that she\u2019s not going to be taken care of the right way. My mom loves her, but she loves her, I don\u2019t know about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">her being there 24\/7. And that\u2019s a little thing, but it\u2019s not a little thing. I mean that she has changed my life. I love her, you know so. I mean it\u2019s not the end of the world, people move with their pets all the time. But I\u2019m just saying there are, that\u2019s an added expense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re taking in the reality of what a<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: What a move would mean. Yeah, yeah. And not just that, yeah I mean here, and friends. I love that, I mean I do love it here. On the other hand, this isn\u2019t like going to London. That\u2019s what thing I\u2019m reminding. You know what\u2019s funny? I was gonna tell you this, when I moved to London. I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">was so in a coma. Remember how like when I left? It was as if I was never gonna come back. You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Umm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s just such an awful way. It saps the excitement of it. Instead of being, I was excited, but I also, it was so dramatic, you know? It\u2019s like yeah it kind of is, but it\u2019s a 5 hour flight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Well there\u2019s another way it would become a sort of, another sense of not having an integrated memory of yourself. It\u2019s as though once one thing is over you\u2019re into the next thing, then you\u2019re only in that next thing instead of it being like yeah it\u2019s a part of your life that you went to London, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">but you have this whole other life here. It\u2019s still part of your life. It\u2019s not going anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Right, right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: That you come back too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Right yeah, and well this all start with San Francisco right? When I went to San Francisco<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: I did not come back I think to visit for 2 years or something. As fucked up as I was I somehow didn\u2019t, and even then for like 10 days or something. I mean. Anyone else would just be coming and going and you know I miss Darien so I just wanna go visit. You know what? I wanna go to Darien for <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">a month. Then I\u2019ll come. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: Like there was no just fucking weird. Again I don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t compute now when I think back on it. So that\u2019s one thing about Assyrian, it is really exciting, are you kidding? I\u2019m gonna go there; teach at the university, awesome experience. Possibly a long term relationship. And then I\u2019m gonna <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">get what I want, which is to be able to come and go. The Cecelia thing, yeah that\u2019s a complication. That\u2019s an added expense, and I feel bad dragging a critter, you know. I know that for animals it\u2019s not easy to travel, and she\u2019s such a housecat. She\u2019s not like a, but that\u2019s a minor inconvenience I mean. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E12\">So yeah I\u2019m trying to remember the what, all day like what? What? I\u2019m not gonna like it? Then I\u2019m gonna come back. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561584\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: Nothing is gonna change here, I\u2019m gonna be in the same situation. Minus an apartment. Fine, whatever. So I don\u2019t know. So as it stands now I don\u2019t see why I wouldn\u2019t go. I don\u2019t I mean. I would have to find some amazing job here. Now how I\u2019m gonna get the money to do any of this, that I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E31\">know that, but I do need find something maybe. I need to make some money or whatever to be able to go. Because they don\u2019t help with relocating, no they don\u2019t help with that. You are getting hired. It\u2019s as if you already lived there, and you are getting hired as an adjunct. You know what I mean?

She was like I was here already. My husband was working in, so she was like I was here, they hired, and in the beginning I did a lot of. Like she was kind of trying to tell me like you know we are kind of gonna use you a little bit, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">know? She was like I kind of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah she was like I did grunt work. Sometimes I worked kind of for free. You know like I just. She\u2019s a chair of the department, you know? Not that I want to do all those things but I kind of see what she\u2019s saying. I mean it\u2019s not the states. It\u2019s a make shift, it\u2019s a totally different mentality <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">and way of doing things. When she called me she was laughing. She\u2019s like I figured I would call you now, because you seem like a night owl, and I\u2019m a night owl, we\u2019re all night owls over here. You\u2019re gonna fit in just great. Like great. But umm. So yeah I don\u2019t see why I wouldn\u2019t. I have friends there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E92\">I have <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: What if you were to get a similar kind of offer [inaudible] but the possibility of doing the same exact thing here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: For that money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Umm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not bad. I mean I have never found an adjuncting job that pays over $2500. This is almost like double that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s say you did 3 courses a year, would you want to stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: I\u2019d think about it, you know the difference is let\u2019s say I did that right? It\u2019s Darien, that\u2019s no money. That\u2019s no money. That\u2019s the problem here. There I feel like, I cannot help it. I\u2019d feel like wow its Armenia, so I am kind of doing something for something that is connected to my heritage. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">That is the reality of that. But also that I am being savvy. I\u2019m getting my foot in the door into something; I know 2 of the Deans for Christ\u2019s sake. You know and now I know this woman. My friend Irene works there from Middletown. I just feel like there\u2019s something about it that seems like a very opportune <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. It\u2019s not just that you would make money there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: No, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Assuming you could get the same job at some point here<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">CLIENT: It can\u2019t be about money, this can\u2019t be about money. I\u2019m gonna find some job doing something. I\u2019m applying to sales jobs now for Christ\u2019s sakes. So I\u2019m gonna make a lot more in sales than I am. No it\u2019s about everything. It\u2019s about, I think going there, even music wise. What I think is things <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD1\">could happen there. Now what is that? It\u2019s a tiny little country, so big whoop, you know, but sometimes it starts with a little thing like that, you know? Here you\u2019re just lost in<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200FC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561584\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Well you know what could happen is that [inaudible] I mean that\u2019s something too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: That\u2019s huge. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No that, but I mean even music wise, like I think it could be the next level of what I\u2019m doing here, kind of coming into my own and really kind of. And then once you are in Armenia, over there it\u2019s different you know? Then it\u2019s not that big of a deal to fly to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201011\">Istanbul to give talk, you know? In other words I think things would really open up. All these places that I love, well 3 hours here, 4 hours that way. Two and a half hours that way. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: It\u2019s, yeah I don\u2019t see a big risk in going, you know? The worst that would happen is that I would get there. It would be okay, I\u2019d maybe not let\u2019s say like the people as much or something, you know what I mean? So the worst would be I\u2019d be like all right I did it for a semester. It\u2019s on my resume, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">it\u2019s a great experience, and it\u2019s not for me, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: And then what\u2019s happening here anyway? I\u2019d come back and pick up where I left off, but now with more teaching experience, and that\u2019s a nice international. It\u2019s an university you know sort off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: Maybe you would have time over there to finish your\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s, and that\u2019s a whole other thing. I think maybe it would kick start the way I was in London, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Exactly, so they can get that [inaudible] at the end of that loan. Get that done with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yup, yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: And then, just how it opens the horizon, at least in that realm as the backup plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then I could start applying anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">CLIENT: To real faculty jobs. Yeah, yeah. No I\u2019m hoping that, I mean I think in general I\u2019m hoping for like kind of what I felt in London over Britain, just to kind of energizing, you know. That\u2019s just such a great feeling. Those feelings I have had over there, so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: Okay. Thanks Claire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: See you tomorrow afternoon. Have a good day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
