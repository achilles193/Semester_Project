I asked the guy upstairs and he gave me the code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Did you know you could come up the stairs as well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I don't know where the stairs are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I usually come up the stairs, like, I mean, I usually take the stairs, but the doors that would let me in there were locked today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Oh, the door kind of opposite the elevator, it is a sneaky door in that the handle won't turn, but if you yank on it, it will open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">[01:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It took me like two years to figure that out, but that's actually the quickest way up because that lets you out on this side of the hallway. So it sticks a little and the knob doesn't turn, but if you just yank it straight out it will open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Okay thanks.

It's okay. After he gave me the code and it worked and I got in so on and so forth I thought I wasn't going to a couple of times, but. [Pause.] I've just had an anxious day today. I don't know.

I was supposed to have an interview with them and then that didn't happen. So I got back in touch with them, which was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And that it brings up the whole job thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] I think it'll be fine. I just really hope it'll be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Well duh. I mean I imagine you're pretty, you know, worried. I mean it's good that you're feeling better, it's good that you have some confidence it will go more or less okay, but of course you're worried it's going to knock you over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know I just keep reminding myself that there is absolutely no reason for it not to go well. You know, I interview well. I'm a good teacher. But of course I'm still fretting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">[06:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">And then of course two out of three recommenders forgot to send the letters, which happens all the time; it's not...that's just how it goes. I [inaudible 06:50] and said you know, if you need me to ask somebody else, I can ask somebody else. At least one woman already wrote me back and was like, oh <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">no.

[Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: I think you should try to put yourself first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: But your well being matters more than the job. I don't mean like from feeling good to feeling great. Like whatever. But your well being matters more than a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Okay, yeah.

I mean, I don't really know how to put my well being first. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: When you say something like it doesn't really matter if I'm okay or not; I've got to get a job. I think that's a little bit like cutting yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Hmm. Okay. [Pause.] I won't say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">[14:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry; I want to be clear. I don't have a problem with you saying that. In fact, like I'm not it's not good to cut yourself but I'm not trying to tell you what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: I mean it's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I think in general, it's not good for you to cut yourself, but I think it's always not good to cut yourself; forget it's better than some other things, some other things but I'm much more interested in what's going on when you're doing it, why, why are you feeling you need to do it? Stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">like that; probably not too surprising. That's much more how I mean like when you say something like about you're going to have to get a job no matter what, like that's the most important thing. There's something about it that, to me, feels like it's a bit of an act of violence towards yourself. Yes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D2\">of course, it would be good if you did not do violent things to yourself, of course, but... [Pause]...I think I'm interested that it seems that way. I don't know if it seems to you that way as well. Am I making sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yes. You're making sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: I still want to cut myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: I [inaudible 17:19].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.

[Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I wasn't trying to [inaudible 18:50] prohibitive; I was trying to say something possible informative. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: I don't understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: In saying, I think when you say something like that it's like cutting yourself; it makes me think of you cutting yourself. I wasn't meaning to say anything prohibitive like you shouldn't do that. I was saying something...if it's right, it's informative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: That there's some kind of act of violence towards yourself in there. It seems to me.

It's very difficult because you also feel such pressure and such demand to get back to being functional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: I'm trying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And I think what I said probably kind of made you feel like you were kind of doing it wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: Maybe a little bit. That's okay. [Pause.] I mean, I sort of already feel like I'm doing it wrong, to be clear.

[Pause.] [inaudible 28:14]. Yeah, I just feel like I'm doing it wrong most of the time. But...

Is it that you don't feel as bad or as suicidal, or the bouts or less frequent or more distance from those things somehow? [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: I feel like I'm less sort of plunged in to despair. Now it's just easier for me to kind of keep on going. [Pause.] Yeah. Now I don't; I get sad, but I feel like I don't get as sad as often to not...yeah. [Pause.] It's not like sinking in to a pit. So that's good.

So maybe I won't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like there's a part of you that wants to tear it down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. I don't trust it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You don't trust feeling better as opposed to not trusting that part of yourself unless you tear it down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.
