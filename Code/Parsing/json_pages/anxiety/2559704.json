But by one o'clock on Monday I'm like \"Phew, I'm so glad she's leaving.\" You know? On the one hand, you know, for my kids I'm disappointed, but for me it's the perfect amount of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Forty seven hours.

And I was like, \"Well.\" (clears throat) And I refuse to acknowledge that I was, you know, I'm like if she's going to play this game, it doesn't matter. When the call comes I'll find out. But I figured it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">something along that line. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: But I was like, you know, I don't know how long my brother's been going out with this woman but, you know, it just didn't seem like that was it. But that was like the first thing that came to mind. And I really couldn't, you know, so whatever. You know? And I think she was disappointed she didn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200551\">get to tell me, which was nice. So (laughs) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">So then he calls. And my Mom has this really bad habit of, you know, it's like she has to call my Grandma while I'm there and shove the phone in my face and say, \"Here, talk to Grandma.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: And she's like, \"Oh, Cameron doesn't want to talk to you.\" You know, I mean, she's just, you know. So brother called, \"Here, congratulate your brother.\" And I'm like, (sigh). So I'm like, \"Congratulations.

Whoops! (laughs) \"Oh, I already had that.\" And he's like, \"You're the one who needs to be evaluated.\" And I go, \"I've been evaluated on multiple occasions and I would not marry you.\" (laughs) I just hope he doesn't ask me to be his best man. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: He did last time. That was a long time ago. I don't know if he has any friends. So, but my Mom, this was like just classic Mom. I don't know how it came up but it just came out of the blue. She was talking about how, you know, weeks ago, a month ago, whenever when Kaley moved in with my brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: She posted on Facebook a picture of the house saying, \"This is my house.\" My Mom -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Kaley posted on Facebook?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Saying that this house is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: The house that she's moving into, \"This is my house.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: The house owned by my brother. So my Mom is all offended, to this day she's offended, because she thinks that Kaley Now she's telling me this knowing that my brother is proposing and the he is going to call, because she's already told me. So I know, you know, maybe her opinion of Kaley would <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">change now that she's, you know, a future daughter-in-law, but no. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">You know, this woman is sort of saying, \"Hey, look what I got.\" And my Mom, you know she's a accountant right? (laughs) \"She's not some, you know, bloodsucking You know, this is how Facebook works. You have all these friends that you like to communicate with and you have one nice little package where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">you can talk to a lot of them at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">\"And she wanted her friends to know that she was moving and that this is what her new residence looked like. So she put it on Facebook and that's what Facebook's for.\" My Mom refuses We got into it yesterday in front of like twenty people waiting in line at the neighborhood restaurant in Plymouth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">\"You're insane. You are insane.\" And she just kind of laughed which, you know. And then I tried to get her to admit that the real reason she likes Kaley is because she's religious. And she knew what I was trying to do so she wouldn't say it. \"All I want is for her to make him happy.\" That's what I told Marcia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">I said, \"It doesn't matter to my Mom that you're not religious, she just wants you to make me happy.\" Because that's what she says and I don't believe it. This is just, you know, she's got a different weird 1950's American Princess, southern belle, you know, melting pot of these weird ideas about the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">You know, my cousin got married years ago out in Oregon. We were in Portland, Oregon and my Mom is complaining that the women there were wearing sandals (pause) to a wedding (pause) in Oregon. Where that's probably all these people owned were sandals. You know? And everybody is just like, \"You're crazy.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">\"Well in Austin everybody would .\" But that's Austin, you know, where everybody overdresses for everything. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">But I'm exhausted. You know, long weekend, very little sleep, lots of drinking. (whispers) Phew, I'm tired. Got all my workouts in. (inaudible at 00:08:33) (pause) I've got handball tonight. I really don't want to go play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: She makes you feel like shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559704\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: My mom?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Nah, not any more. I mean when she says things like, you know, like when she doesn't think that You know, she just doesn't appreciate, you know, what's happening to me or what's happened to me or, you know, that kind of stuff makes me feel bad. But this other stuff is really just, I'm so used <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">to it, you know, that I just kind of It used to drive me crazy. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">Like she was complaining about how this thing happened. They all went I went to a barbecue and she went with Jess and the kids to Cheesecake Factory. And my Mom's telling this long story about how, \"We were brought up to the table and we were schlepped with the kids and the coats and the strollers, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">and through the crowd of people and da da.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">\"And the table was dirty and so the lady wanted them to go all the way back so they could clean the table. But then we went here and they cleaned the table, and da da da. But the table wasn't clean so we da da da.\" And, you know, just. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">And so it's like this was probably all of five minutes waiting for the table to be cleaned. They were trying to find another table for them that was clean. You know. So my Mom is telling this like twenty minute story. And, you know, we get to breakfast with Jess and my Mom kind of mentions it to Jess. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">And Jess's like, \"What? Huh?\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">I mean that's probably where I get it from. Don't you think? Doesn't mental health travel down the mother's side of the family? At least that's what Kurt Vonnegut says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Hm. Um.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: His Mom was crazy, his grandmother was crazy, he was crazy. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Your tone as you're talking I think is much less about feeling like her than as feeling subject to her. I mean it's like you find her incredibly self-absorbed and she's always -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Dramatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Helpless. Did I mention \"helpless.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I don't think she sounds helpless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Maybe I'm doing a bad job of explaining her, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well I think if you genuinely found her helpless, you might feel bad for her. But I don't think you feel bad for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You're furious at her because I think you find her to be manipulative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And self-serving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: You know, so that this helplessness I think you feel like it's a pose in order to get you to do things or to feel things, feel bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Like she sends me a text, \"This weekend we're going shopping to get an iPad.\" I'm like, \"No.\" (clears throat)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: That doesn't sound helpless to me. That sounds more like she's, you know, actually pretty effective. (laughs) It's just that you're so prepared for it, it's not quite going to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: I was like go to the She was like, \"I need you to load it for me.\" I'm like, \"Mom (inaudible at 00:12:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? But like your description of her is not so much that she's actually helpless, as that she presents herself as being helpless in order to manipulate you. Which is, I think, quite different. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Well, it's that, you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Well you sound furious, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: Do I?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: Hm. It's kind of hot in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: It isn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Maybe it's because you're furious.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559704\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:13:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's like there's one part of me that like wants her to be happy because she knows not what she does. You know, she's been doing it for so long, she's going to be seventy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Oh I think you feel like she knows what she does. When she calls you up and says, \"Oh, I'm at the Apple store.\" I mean first of all she's saying, \"We're going to the Apple Store.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: That's totally manipulative. She's not saying, \"Oh my God, I don't know what to do. I want to get an iPad but I'm so overwhelmed.\" She's saying, \"We're going.\" She's telling you what to do. That's not that helpless. You know, she knows exactly where she wants to go, exactly how she's going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">to try to get you to go there, exactly how she's going to try to get you to do the things she wants you to do. That really doesn't sound that helpless to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: Maybe you're right. Because I know the whole religious thing is not about, you know, perpetuation of the species and, you know, assimilation and all those things. It's about the ability to tell her friends that, \"My son is dating a religious woman.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's about her. I mean, I think she's like very self-involved. You know? If she can say something that's going to make her feel like she looks better to the people she's around at home, that's what's going to matter the most to her. Not that her sons are happy with who they are with, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">or what those women are actually like as human beings. But that she can say something to her friends that she feels will make her look good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">Which is really pretty gross. I mean this is your kid. And from what you're describing like, yeah, you don't really care at all the character of the person that they're with. You know? What that person's like, how they treat your son, whether they make him happy. What you care about is, you know, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">can look this much better in the eyes of your cronies at wherever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: (whispers) [She's a accountant.] (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: (laughs) The way you describe it, it's really disgusting. And it may be very familiar, but I don't think that makes it feel any better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: It's annoying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I think it's a vast understatement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well you know me, I'm subtle. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Sometimes you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: (clears throat) I think maybe part of it too is now I don't let the stuff at least get to me as much as I used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it gets to you actually a lot. But it does sound like you kind of roll with it better and you're not quite as, you're not as reactive to it in the moment with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: I mean everything's like that now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: I find that there's a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But I think it really gets to you. I mean if you're saying I mean in a pretty quiet way you have a litany of things, you know, that you're furious with. \"Well, she's here less than fucking forty eight hours. You know what, I didn't even want her here that long, but it's still gross <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F11\">that that's all that she can be here.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: And you know what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: She's taking a fourteen day cruise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: In July.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: She's got two grandkids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: She's taking unpaid vacation days to go on a fucking cruise.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559704\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Lucille did really well with them.

Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: And I was holding Lucille and we were sitting next to Poppa, we were at the pool. And Poppa was going (loud clap), and Lucille's going (soft clap). And it was just this cute little back and forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: And my Mom has got her iPhone up and she claims to videotaping and just like this is, you know, Lucille's not going to remember him. You know, she's two, he's eighty five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: This is going to be a great video for her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: And so my Mom was like, \"Uh oh. Uh oh.\" So I grabbed the phone and I hit play and the video is five seconds. This thing went on for like three or four minutes. Five seconds of Poppa's knee. Whoops.

And so she doesn't want anything to do with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: No, she actually likes it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">CLIENT: Because that's her husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: Not my Dad.

A really weird thing happened on Saturday. Was it Saturday or Sunday? I think it was Sunday. Well we went out.

You know, her birthday is tomorrow so they're throwing a little birthday party. And I, you know, hung out with the family, went out to dinner, whatever, and then, you know, I drove down to Burnley. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">CLIENT: And, you know, we were just up all night having a good time. So the next day, I don't know, I made some comment, you know, about her friends or something like that. So she texted something back. And I said, \"Yeah, you know,\" and just jokingly I said, \"You know, they're all douche bags.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">And first her response was like, \"What?\" (laughs) And then I'm like, \"You know, I'm just kidding. They're all really cool people,\" you know, whatever, \"and I really like them.\" And then she replies back, \"No, they're douche bags.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">And then, I didn't pick it up. It took me later in the day to kind of recognize what she was We weren't talking about the same things. She was kind of going down this line of joking focusing on the douche bag thing. And so she's like, \"You know, well maybe we're just not compatible.\" You know, \"Take <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201571\">it easy,\" you know, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20156-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20156-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559704\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">And every time I would, you know, send a message At first I was playing along with it, you know. And then I was kind of, \"Oh, this is,\" you know, \"getting old.\" You know? And, you know, kind of bothering me. Like her not returning a text right away bothered me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">CLIENT: You know, but knowing that it's silly. You know. So I went and took a nap. And, you know, I sent her some messages. You know, sort of expecting kind of a response. You know. I took a nap. I was exhausted. And I woke up and it had been a couple of hours. And it was like, you know, I hadn't heard <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D1\">back from her. And I was like, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">So I was like, you know, \"Is anybody out there,\" whatever. And her response was like, \"I'm trying to lose you,\" or something like that. And it started to really bother me at that point because I'm like, you know, this isn't just, you know, a fun little thing that happened. You know, this is now several <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F1\">hours later and she is still <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: On that thread.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: You know. So eventually I was just like, you know, \"I'm really not having fun.\" Even though I said that a couple of times, and she still kept going on with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">CLIENT: And then finally I was just like, you know, this is. you know. \"I'm, you know, one to love joking and whatever,\" I said, \"but, you know, you kind of dragged this on a little long and I really didn't like it.\" You know? And because she was kind of saying, you know, that I can't take a joke or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201671\">something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">And then she replies and she's like, \"Yeah, you know, that was mean. But it was mean of you to call my friends douche bags.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">CLIENT: So she was like dragging this whole thing out -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">CLIENT: thinking it was funny. And I should've thought it was funny too, which I did initially. But actually I was really not liking it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20175\">CLIENT: It suggests to me [that I might not like her] (ph) or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20179\">CLIENT: For me to, you know, stay on the porch -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">CLIENT: while the big dogs are out there running. You know? (pause) I noticed it.

I look at things now and I'm like, \"Why am I feeling like that?\" You know? (pause) We went to the baseball game last night. She spent the night over. She's been having her period for like three weeks now. No, it's I can't remember what night it was, but she's like, \"I have my period.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201811\">And this was maybe like last Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20183\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20185\">CLIENT: And I kind of was like doing the math and I was like, \"God, has it been a month already?\" You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20187\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20189\">CLIENT: And then Saturday night she was like, \"You're not going to believe this.\" She's like, \"But, you know, I guess I was only spotting.\" I don't know what that means. \"But I'm having my period.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018D\">CLIENT: Okay.

I'm not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">But, you know, I think what you said about how your Mom was this weekend, and a kind of a tone that you've set and feeling so (inaudible) about it. And what you said about Jess and also what you said about Marcia. Like, God, it's like it's a revelation that somebody could be nice to you the way she <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB1\">is.

Because like how could you sort of trust <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF1\">that I would have those conversation in your interest rather than in some more self-serving way?

You may not be surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: I wouldn't use the word \"betrayal.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: She's totally siding with your ex-wife?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: She's not siding with her, but she's, you know -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: She's saying, I mean, in not so many words, \"She's awesome.\" Or, \"She's doing well.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Or like I mean I imagine somehow feeling like, \"Is she doing better without you?\" \"I'm hanging out with her and not as much fun hanging out with you.\" That is somewhat a betrayal.

Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">Or least this sense of like \"Gosh, [I don't exactly] (ph) know what you were talking about about how difficult she was.

And I think Jess might be a little right on this that he still has strep. He's been sick for a couple of weeks and they don't know what's causing the strep. And they think it might be allergies so they've got him on <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202031\">Claritin, which I think might be giving him a little bit of an energy boost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">THERAPIST: Sure.

So, you know, it's like, \"Hey,\" you know, this was yesterday, I was like \"You know, Tuesday when I'm playing handball in the square, it's like, you know, it would be a game for Ian to come to.\" So I said something to Jess. And at first she's like, \"No, he needs sleep. It's the first day <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B1\">back to school. He's going to be tired.\" You know, every excuse not to do it because it's really going to inconvenience her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022F\">CLIENT: You know.

He just keeps going on. \"Put the can down.\" And then he kind of starts walking over, but he's still kind of swinging it, water is still flying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2023B1\">over. And she said it like two more times and he still had it in his hand. And he was clearly going to put it down, but he wasn't putting it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023F\">CLIENT: So I was like, \"Buddy, you're not going to handball tomorrow.

And he gets pissed off, rightly so, because he sees it as <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202431\">her taunting because the way she didn't do it as a punishment thing, she did it as, \"Well maybe you shouldn't go because, you know, you're sick and you need rest.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20245\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20247\">CLIENT: And, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20249\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2024B\">CLIENT: Not the line I was going on where, \"You've been a real prick all weekend.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2024D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2024F\">CLIENT: You know?

He just, you know. But (pause) He calls me at seven thirty and I'm in Burnley. I just woke up on the couch at Marcia's friend's house. And the phone rings, Jess was calling. Why is she calling me at seven thirty? I'm thinking maybe something's the matter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20275\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20277\">CLIENT: So I answer it. It's Ian. \"Hi Daddy. When are you coming over?\" I'm like, okay, I'm in Burnley. I need to go home and probably clean up a little bit and, you know. I'm like, \"I got to get ready and whatever but I'll be home in a while.\" You know? So I go home, he calls again. \"When are you coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202771\">over?\" You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20279\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027B\">CLIENT: It took me forever to get over there. And finally, I'm like block away, and it's like, \"Where are you? When are you coming over?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027F\">CLIENT: I'm my usual, I'm in Vermont or whatever. \"What? Oh, oh oh.\" You know? And as I'm like pulling into the driveway he was thinking about coming over. And so I hang up with him and knock on the door. \"Oh.\" And he goes, \"Daddy!\" So, yeah, I feel a little guilty about, you know, I've now got a make <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2027F1\">choices between Marcia and the kids. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20281\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20283\">CLIENT: You know, I was doing a lot of that this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20285\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20287\">CLIENT: But I don't know. It'll work itself out. It will be easier when, you know, and I don't know at what point, you know, if you say this is fine for her to meet the kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20289\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028B\">CLIENT: Like right now I don't see a problem with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028F\">CLIENT: I'm sure Jess would.
