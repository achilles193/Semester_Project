I\u2019m not sure I should be selling cars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s sort of (inaudible at 00:01:29) all-encompassing, yet unsatisfying. So, to me, it\u2019s a lot of time and energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: How long you been there now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Since, I think, February, so almost three months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Almost three months? Yeah. What are your thoughts on\u2014?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well, my thinking is, I could do it very well, but it\u2019s surprising that I don\u2019t. And the reason I don\u2019t is mostly because people around me have decided that I won\u2019t. It\u2019s an unusual situation where I\u2019ve agreed to listen to my superiors. It sounds half crazy, but I actually have agreed to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">what someone above me says without thinking about it.  And a lot of the things they tell me to do don\u2019t make sense. On reflection, they don\u2019t make any sense, but I\u2019ve done them anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">And so it (pause) \u2013 I\u2019m used to being treated in a special way, I think. Wherever I go, I think I feel like I should be some sort of royalty or something, recognized as exceptional. And I\u2019ve reached a field where that\u2019s sort of an accepted way of going about business, but I\u2019m not in that class. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">treated like a kindling (ph), or whatever you call it.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">Yeah, I have the capability, but I\u2019m not committed to do things. It\u2019s an uphill battle every single time a customer comes in, and my managers are just very hostile. It\u2019s not exclusively with me, but that combined with the fact that they won\u2019t let me take customers means I can\u2019t do very well. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">they just won\u2019t let me take customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they have like a kind of a pecking order, where if somebody\u2019s free, that person gets\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like a batting order in baseball, except the one, two, three, and four hitters just keep going, unless there\u2019s, like, a ball (ph) in play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve got you, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And it doesn\u2019t seem to be based on effectiveness or, like, the effectiveness of selling cars as much as control. I get the distinct feeling that one of my managers just wants me to \u2013 I mean, he said once \u2013 I\u2019ll finish my sentence \u2013 he wants me to lose my pride, or something, my sort of self-respect. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">Because he said once, \u201cStop looking like you know better or you\u2019re better than everyone,\u201d or something. I forget what he said. But the fact was, on that occasion, I\u2019d done my job perfectly, and he still talked everything up like someone else \u2013 Andrew (ph) didn\u2019t get the sale. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What happened? Maybe that\u2019s a good example for me to just get a read on what\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Okay, well, one time I remember \u2013 I\u2019m trying to think of the exact time he said that. Oh, yeah, this time \u2013 so I\u2019m supposed to greet the person, get to know them, get to know what they want, give them one vehicle that meets all their needs, get them to like the vehicle, and then get a commitment <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">from them to buy it and then turn them over. So I greeted the person, and then I started talking to them, and I got yelled out by Irish Man for taking too long talking to him, even though I\u2019d only talked to him for like two and a half minutes.  He yelled at me in front of the customer, so after that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">it was more difficult to control them. They didn\u2019t have as much respect for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563465\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">The other manager jumped in and started asking all the same questions I\u2019d already asked them, and they came on a specific vehicle, like one vehicle. I just wanted to get \u2013 whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter what I wanted \u2013 so he asked the same questions again. Then he said, \u201cOh, get this model over here. Bring <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">that one up.\u201d So as I was going to get that one \u2013 just to show it to them because you sort of show them the vehicle \u2013the guy who was part of the couple was saying, \u201cCan we just drive it? Can we drive it?\u201d because he had no respect for me because he\u2019d seen me yelled at. He thought he could just walk <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">over me, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Then, as I\u2019m bringing up the car, the manager comes \u2013 the guy who\u2019d started asking the same questions I was asking \u2013 comes up in another car, in his car that he drives, a demo for the dealership, and says, \u201cDo you want to drive this car?\u201d So usually suggestions from the managers are sort of things to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">do, so we got in that car. And it\u2019s a different car, but it still had this dry cleaning in the back seat. We drove it around. We got back, and he sat down with them. I mean, he took over. They won\u2019t let me do my job. They won\u2019t let me do my job, and so I knew I had done everything I could in that situation, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">so I just sat there. There\u2019s nothing I can say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I see. Okay. Yeah, you hadn\u2019t done anything to \u2013 you were doing the kind of the steps you normally do. Why did the Greek guy kind of butt in and say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking too long\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Does he want you to hand them off right away or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, it might be because they knew exactly what model they wanted, and find (ph) that I should just go and get the model, like the exact one they want and show them that. But in my mind, in order to \u2013 this is what I\u2019m thinking now, not then \u2013 but I need to get to know the people. I get to know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">what they think is important, so that I can show them that on the car \u2013 so, \u201cthis lines up with what you wanted; this lines up with what you wanted.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: But more, trying to figure out your own way to \u2013 you\u2019re just using your own judgment to \u2013 but they were, like, butting in, and taking it\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Taking it over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Taking it over, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: And the thing is, I don\u2019t think they understand me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m not understandable, so they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing. Like I asked someone in Service if she\u2019d send me information about yoga. She was not buying a car, right? So I said, \u201cWho\u2019s the yoga instructor?\u201d and she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">sitting there reading. I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m interested in that. Send me some information.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s just a way of getting her contact information because I wouldn\u2019t be able to ask her for it\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: [There\u2019s a law to prevent it.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: But a connection either way is \u2013 it works. It\u2019s what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think they completely understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What do they think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s just one example. I don\u2019t even know if they saw that. That\u2019s just one example. I do all kinds of stuff like that, and it\u2019s not what they\u2019re used to.  I\u2019ve been trying to \u2013 you know, the Irish guy, who I like \u2013 he\u2019s a good manager, if he\u2019s done kind of \u2013 whatever, he\u2019s a good manager; <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">that\u2019s the truth. And I\u2019ve been obeying his word to listen to my managers. \u201cJust work with your managers. Work with your managers. And do what they say.\u201d I\u2019m doing what they say, but it doesn\u2019t work because I\u2019m not just like an empty vessel. I guess I have my own way of doing things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563465\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s not \u2013 a good team just accepts \u2013 not \u201cjust\u201d \u2013 but a good team accepts people for how they are, and then sort of builds on their strengths and uses those and incorporates them into a single system. But I\u2019ve tried sort of bending over backwards, basically, just effacing (ph) any sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">of judgment (ph).  He keeps trying to do things, and it\u2019s not working because I\u2019m not like a slave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Trying to be an empty vessel, but you\u2019re not \u2013 you can\u2019t really be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yep. So I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s a curious thing because I \u2013 they\u2019ve told me, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it here, you can just go,\u201d and I feel the same way. I mean, if you don\u2019t like me, just fire me, but no one\u2019s really taken that step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Do they give you any kind of base salary?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, though they just eliminated overtime, it seems like. You\u2019re never sure, but I mean, they\u2019re very disrespectful. Like, I need my manager\u2019s help to see if I can sell a person a car who wants to trade in this car, but they have to pay off this much, and if we have a certain kind of trade-in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">from customers that another customer might want. So if someone brings in a car with 100,000 miles, I have someone who\u2019ll buy it.  And I bring this to his attention once or twice, and he doesn\u2019t act on it. He sort of punts the whole day. I mean, he does nothing with it. If I ask things, I\u2019m not always <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">answered. It\u2019s just like, I think the fact that I don\u2019t fear my superiors, it gets to them in some way. It\u2019s not like \u2013 I do everything; I do everything they say, as well as I can. So when they yell at me or something, I just don\u2019t care because I know I\u2019ve done the best I possibly can. And if there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B3\">were anything reasonable in what they were saying, I would have done it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">For instance, I had one responsibility of making sure every single vehicle had a sticker and tag and was all set. So I was doing that one morning, going out and doing every single one, sort of wiping the dirt off from putting labels on \u2013 on my shirt \u2013 and I come inside, and the guy yells at me for not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">following up with this, and I say, \u201cWell, that was my next job.\u201d I can\u2019t do two things at once. It\u2019s just absurd. But I didn\u2019t say that. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I just sort of \u2013 I don\u2019t verbally fight it. I\u2019m disrespected, and I sort of sit there, but I don\u2019t accept that it has any bearing on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">who I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">Yeah, I kind of went through a process with the last manager where I \u2013 we didn\u2019t jive very well, but at least he was a guy who was trying as hard as possible. He wasn\u2019t trustworthy. He wasn\u2019t really a good person. He wasn\u2019t a good worker, but he was still trying. He was trying as hard as he could to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">work with the people around him. He was trying to get better, like a good Christian, or something like that. That\u2019s a bad analogy, but he was trying. You could tell he was sort of stretching to try to do the best he could every day, even though, not that much business. He didn\u2019t have that many social <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">\u2013 whatever you call it \u2013 social capital, or whatever it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563465\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">And so I reached an accord with him because I said, \u201cYou know what? I respect you. I want to work with you,\u201d and that worked, but then he got fired. And so I feel like I used up my independence. All that friction I went through with him, it wasn\u2019t for any good, and here I am kind of depleted and ready <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">to follow manager\u2019s orders, and a new manager comes in, who\u2019s just kind of gross and disrespectful. I don\u2019t have the same newness, or the same unwashed quality, to oppose him with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what comes up between you two? Is this the Greek guy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: No, this Irish guy who\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Irish guy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Irish guy who goes down to the sales manager. It doesn\u2019t even make any sense. There should just be two mangers, the Irish guy and the other guy who\u2019s under him, but they put a third person in, and that person\u2019s like desperately (inaudible at 00:16:29) to do anything because there\u2019s three managers <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">and six salesmen. One of the salesmen doesn\u2019t even do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So [he\u2019s really fond of you.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) So it\u2019s a strange sort of corporate hiring situation. We have a boss, and then that boss is in charge of two stores and a lot of people, but there\u2019s one guy in the particular showroom under him, and then there\u2019s one guy over him. It\u2019s not like there are three or four people under <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">him, just one guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So just the normal (inaudible at 00:17:04).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: I think it would contribute to a lot of backseat driving, or leapfrogging, or whatever you want to call it. Because there\u2019s one person under you, and you\u2019re the boss. You\u2019re thinking, probably, \u201cWell, I would do it this way. I would do it this way,\u201d and you have enough (ph) time to say, \u201cDo <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">it this way,\u201d which is a problem. (chuckles) [It was superficial\u2014] (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: But they also wanted \u2013 I thought they also clashed about how to manage you, or how to manage the sales force.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yep. Yeah, so this particular guy, who\u2019s new \u2013 he\u2019ll just throw out accusations. He\u2019ll be like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do this.\u201d Like, he said at the time, \u201cThere\u2019s no basis in fact.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYes, actually I did,\u201d or \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d But he still just does it all the time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">It\u2019s like some sort of defense mechanism. (pause) [Then he smiles.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. What are you saying about selling cars in general, though? Are you saying that it\u2019s not\u2014? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I just need an open floor. I need to be able to do my job. I need to be able to do my job. If you won\u2019t let me do my job, then, I\u2019m not going to be happy. I\u2019m not sure if selling cars \u2013 I\u2019m thinking about it twice because they\u2019re not trustworthy people that I\u2019m working for. I\u2019ve had promises <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">broken. (inaudible at 00:18:58) a year ago (ph), a lot of energy. Funny how the things sort of sit\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does sound like you\u2019ve thrown yourself into it. Do you feel like you are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and even the best I could hope for in the business probably wouldn\u2019t be what I want to do, and the main problem is, I don\u2019t have faith I could do anything better with my time, even if I weren\u2019t doing this. I mean, I can\u2019t structure my time. I can\u2019t do anything in the order it should be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563465\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Do you have other ambitions that are more structuraled (ph) at this point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: More than what?

I still have a problem where I can\u2019t really \u2013 I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">even try to achieve goals anymore because I don\u2019t have faith in my own happiness or an opinion of my ability to not disappoint myself or other people.

What bothers me is, I need to work on my classes, and I work the job so I can take the classes, but I end up focusing on the job rather than the classes. Yeah, so I got like a D+ (ph) in the last one, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Why?

What do you take, like an extension (ph) school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s pretty good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve liked it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Um-hum. (inaudible at 00:23:20) (pause) Yeah, that\u2019s my main problem. I can\u2019t work on these things. I can\u2019t get it into any kind of order. Like, when I get home, my room\u2019s a mess. I spend \u2013 when I\u2019m home, most of the time I spend in my room. It\u2019s a nice big room, but there\u2019s a keyboard out there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">and there\u2019s a computer, a bed. I kind of read in bed because it\u2019s comfortable, and I just fall asleep, or I watch porn, or I just don\u2019t pursue things in any productive way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny, though. I guess, like one thing I was wondering about is, is it something to do with where you\u2019re headed, though? Do you have like an idea of where you\u2019re wanting to head towards?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563465\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: No, not really. (pause) I had some thinking about that. I guess what\u2019s helpful when you\u2019re younger is, that if you work at, like, endotropic (ph) projects \u2013 like, things that make sense to you long-term \u2013 one thing parents can do, or mentors, or people who support you, especially when you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">youngest, is they give you positive feedback while you\u2019re sort of working towards something. So you have that feedback in the short term that keeps you going towards the long-term good.  But if you\u2019re older, or you\u2019re isolated, you have to work towards your long-term good without any sort of positive <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF2\">feedback on the way. In fact, there\u2019s just stresses on the way if you want to do something long-term that makes it very difficult to sleep well or to pick the things, or to \u2013 you get the negative feedback because you\u2019re taking away from something else in the present. There is that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">Also, what comes to mind is, I mean, since Lawrenceville, I haven\u2019t had the capacity or the faith to pursue something, or hope for any kind of reward. It\u2019s part of why I dropped out because I was convinced Birmingham would disappoint me in some way, in the same way I\u2019d been disappointed before. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">what I\u2019m searching for then, in both cases, and still now, is some sort of bond with people, like a (inaudible at 00:25:35) relationship, I guess, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yep. (pause) There\u2019s something about going toward something that you feel will disappoint you, it\u2019s hard to have something \u2013 you\u2019re not sure what to have in mind then as an endpoint, or something to strive for, if it\u2019s going to be\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know what\u2019s interesting is that, if I see it, I can do it. What I\u2019ve done is, I\u2019ve taken on things that people have shown me, if I\u2019ve had even a brief bond with people. Like, I wouldn\u2019t have considered going into sales before I had Edgar as a roommate, who was in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that what\u2014?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Did he sell cars? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: No, he sold software, but I mean, after moving out, and that situation, then I go into sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Was it with the idea of helping also to bond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: It was almost like trying to recover it in some way, I don\u2019t know. (pause) (inaudible at 00:28:13) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it kind of occurs to me that some of the really formative experiences of striving for something, whether it\u2019s an academic interest or it\u2019s a woman, has ended up being profoundly disappointing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to say \u2013 think of like staying on some road or even getting on a road \u2013 towards something that you wonder if it\u2019s not disappointing. (inaudible at 00:29:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I jump off at the last minute sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t remember now. (pause)  But I work towards something; then when it\u2019s almost in hand, I sort of kill it, or cut it off and move on to something else. I take control of it, rather than risk a disappointment or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there must be something about just having it in hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t know what I should do. Maybe I should try to move over to another dealership; a friend suggested that. Maybe I should look elsewhere. I need to keep paying the rent. I don\u2019t have any flexibility, unless I start taking money from my parents, which I \u2013 maybe it could help <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E51\">me, I don\u2019t know.  I could probably ask for help. I\u2019ve never asked for help, though, from when I was from tenth grade up. I mean, I always felt bad that my family had spent money on school.

I mean, I\u2019ve never seen it where it isn\u2019t, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. The fact is he\u2019s pretty understanding. He\u2019s a really good father, good parent. He doesn\u2019t ask for much, but I still wouldn\u2019t want to ask for help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Well, to help is to be influence, too. To take help is to be influenced, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: To take help is to be influenced?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563465\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: I mean, (chuckles) I\u2019m like (inaudible at 00:39:06) like I feel that I\u2019m somewhere else, I think, because \u2013 or that sort of stiffness that my manager picked up on, that I\u2019m better than my surroundings. I mean, I\u2019m in a dealership. I stepped in the break room; they\u2019re all like gray file cabinets. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201231\">The people I\u2019m around are [giving me my old nickname]. I haven\u2019t heard that since middle school, maybe, and they think they\u2019re clever. So I still have this sense of entitlement, but where I am is pretty backwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s not a lot of guys, though, who went to Lawrenceville, straight (chuckles) and headed to the dealership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I\u2019ll just say, \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. [] to you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s (inaudible at 00:39:57) \u201cDoctor.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: (laughter) (pause) Because they\u2019re demanding that it be a career. I mean, I\u2019m thinking of it as a way to make money. You\u2019re supposed to have a career in car sales, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: They must wonder what the hell you\u2019re doing there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah, a lot of people do. I know it\u2019s good, though. I mean, I want to own a car. I want to bed more women. I want to win the sales practice. I want to build relationships with people at work. I want to be able to do what I want without being tied down too much \u2013 like a structured system that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">has me meeting people and working through a system that\u2019s attractive to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: I wonder if they think that you\u2019re not there for the long haul. I mean, even in the career, and it\u2019s somewhat \u2013 not that you\u2019re bringing this to it \u2013 but that they feel like, \u201cOh, who\u2019s this really smart guy? Is he just visiting for a while to see our land, and is he going to take off when <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">he\u2019s gotten what he wants out of the experience?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Maybe they don\u2019t think that much about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) I missed the bus the other day. It\u2019s interesting because the Irish guy was telling stories. There\u2019s something about him that reminds me of the family I came from, where \u2013 I guess from this area where my grandfather was born.  There\u2019s something familiar, and I\u2019m not sure whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">it\u2019s retrograde or not, but wanting to tell stories, it motivates people, and that speaks about things. It\u2019s a familiar dialect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: Do you like it, though? Do you like the way he talks to people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah, he\u2019s very good. He\u2019s very good. He knows to sort of encourage people, every single person for little things. The fact is, he sees things differently than they are. So many times, he\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, you\u2019re doing this,\u201d and he\u2019s saying a positive thing, like, \u201cOh, look you\u2019re doing this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201371\">Oh, look, you\u2019re doing this,\u201d and it\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing. But, still, it\u2019s just the feeling that he\u2019s watching and he\u2019s supportive. It\u2019s funny, because it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s almost never right, what he says. If you say, \u201cOh, I have this problem.\u201d He says, \u201cOh, I know exactly the problem you\u2019re talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201372\">about. You just have to do this.\u201d He\u2019s completely wrong; that\u2019s not the problem I\u2019m talking about. But he\u2019s\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: With a spirit of encouragement?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s frustrating and nice at the same time. But what was happening is, he starts telling stories at like 7:40 or 7:30 every weekend. It\u2019s almost like clockwork. He starts talking about some old friend or some guy who\u2019d been out of prison or what happened, and the guys sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B1\">of gather around to listen to him in the showroom. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s organized; it just happens. And the last bus leaves at 7:40, and so I should really leave, but I stay just five minutes just to listen to him tell the story and started running to the bus, and I missed it. And they\u2019re good stories, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B2\">but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth me walking a couple miles and be home an hour and a half later. It\u2019s sort of an analogy for the whole dealership experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2013A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563465\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Well, exactly that.

(chuckles) It\u2019s a pleasant detour for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: I mean, in one respect, I hear that you are looking for help in the sense of an encouragement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t mean that you still don\u2019t want and look for, also, practical \u2013 like, how do I build, though, from where I\u2019m at \u2013 but that you appreciate the encouragement, that they\u2019re both necessary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing the car business taught me, is if you get motivated to do something, you can do anything. It\u2019s just about being motivated to do it, and it often helps to have someone outside motivating you. You can do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: I know there\u2019s a lot to you being at Lawrenceville and everything, and maybe what it meant to be at Birmingham, but what I sense is that one thing that was in your mind about Lawrenceville was, \u201cThis is costing people something. I\u2019m doing something for myself that\u2019s\u2026\u201d \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D1\">call it discouragement \u2013 but if your mother\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, this is costing us.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Hmm.

If it\u2019s too good to be true, I expected I\u2019d get over there, and I wouldn\u2019t be where I\u2019d hoped for, and all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: Do you have a sense of how or what would have been \u2013 what you were expecting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: (pause)  It\u2019s just dry. I mean, (pause) yeah, I remember at Lawrenceville, I expected academics. Birmingham, I expected academics. It sounds absurd to think that it wouldn\u2019t be academically-focused there, but I\u2019m not sure I was that convinced it would be. I\u2019m not sure I was convinced there would <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201571\">be a life to the learning. I guess that\u2019s not true.
