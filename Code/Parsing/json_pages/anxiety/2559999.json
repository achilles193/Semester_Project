(inaudible 00:42)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: So Monday. Saturday was a trip to the zoo with Eva (sp?). So Ginny and Eva. Eva's 10. What amazed me the most was how confident she was, you know. She gets kind of, like reports come from school that she acts very immature. She wants to play all the baby games [the other kids say] (ph). And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">she wants to play house and stuff like that and with dolls. And I really want to, like, do other stuff, more mature (ph). So, like, we want to hang out, but at the same time, like, she never wants to do anything we want to do. (inaudible 01:28) play those games (inaudible 01:30). She's in the third <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">grade (inaudible 01:34) back a year. And she's old (ph) for her class anyway. Most of her friends are eight. She (inaudible 01:43) but [still the same problem] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So I was expecting her to be a little needy (ph), you know, whatever. But, no, she was very confident the entire time. She got suntan lotion in her eye at one point. And she was trying to wipe it out. And she's like (inaudible 01:57). She's like, \"One second.\" She's like (inaudible 01:59). What, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">we look. And she takes her water bottle, and she puts it up to her eye and opens her eye and (inaudible 02:06) water bottle. And I'm like, \"I hate fucking getting water in my eye.\" I'm like, that was something else. She's like, \"Yeah, it's just like eye drops.\" I'm like, \"Okay, cool.\" I told Bridget <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">(sp?) about that. She's like, \"That's amazing. That's amazing.\" She says every time Eva gets any little, like, scrap or, like, something, she's always like, \"Ah,\" like it's a big deal. She says, \"And I've talked to her about needing to, like, control her reaction (inaudible 02:28).\" She's like, \"It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">just really great to hear she's doing that out in the world,\" you know. I'm like, that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Well, there's something to that. Kids kind of sense when new adults aren't going to tolerate certain things, you know. (inaudible 02:47) \"Why are you freaking out? What's wrong with you? It's a tiny little thing. Chill. Compose (ph) yourself. Breathe.\" (Laughter) That's the kind of parent I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah, help them manage themselves, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, but she didn't have to. She just did it. In various places, you know, we're and I was like, \"So, you done?\" She's like, \"Yeah, we're good here.\" Like, all right. Great. She's very good at advocating for whatever she needs (ph), you know. And so we're at the zoo and Ginny has the map <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">and Ginny's looking at the map. Ginny is very much, by nature, an explorer, all right. So you give Ginny a map (inaudible 03:28). It's just great. (inaudible 03:30) where everything is and talk about how we get to the various places and how we think that's the easier route to see everything [that we] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">(ph) to see. And we're like, \"Great, let's do that.\" At the same time, I'm like, \"Oh, safari trial. I'm going to go this way.\" She's like, \"Yeah, sure. And then we'll just go (inaudible 03:45),\" which is (inaudible 03:46).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">But after a while, Eva's like, \"May I see the map?\" Ginny's like, \"Yeah, sure.\" She's looking at it. She's like, \"Uh-huh, uh-huh.\" Now I see very quickly that she knows where she is. And Ginny's like, \"Okay, so we're here. We're trying to get over this way, so we're going to have to go all the way around <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">here.\" And Eva's like, \"Yep, yep.\" Ginny's still kind of very much like, \"Okay, [I'm going to help you] (ph) read the map.\" And so, we go through the gorilla house, which was amazing because they get, like, this close to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559999\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Through glass. They sit down at (ph) the glass and they stare at you. And you sit that far away and stare at them. It's amazing. And digression. While in that house, I was doing the tether (ph) thing, right, to make sure she's in range (ph) because (inaudible 04:27) doesn't, you know, need me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">to, like, hover (ph), but at the same time, she's young enough I need to know where she is. So (inaudible 04:33) of a hallway, reading some stuff. I went back to the gorillas. Looked back, she's gone. Like, take a few steps off to the side. Yes, I can see her (inaudible 04:42) but that's an interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">experience to have, you know. I'm like, \"Okay, where is the child? There.\" You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">And so we come out of there, and Ginny has to go to the bathroom, so Ginny goes into the bathroom. Eva pulls out the map. She's like, \"Okay, so we're here. We came out this door.\" She's like, \"And the Dippin' Dots are over here, so we need to get back there.\" She's like, \"So we're going to (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">05:08).\" She's like, \"All right, so we have to go around this way here, then go over here, and we'll pass the giraffes here, and this is where the Dippin' Dots are.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, great.\" She's like, \"Okay.\" And I'm like, \"Our route means that we're going to skip the bird cage.\" She's like, \"Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">I don't like flying birds.\" I'm like, \"Me either.\" (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">So Ginny comes out and she sees that Eva has the map. And I'm like, \"Yeah, Eva's planned out our whole route.\" She's like, \"Okay. (inaudible 05:30) Okay, Eva.\" She's like, \"We're here.\" And I'm like, \"No, she's got it. Like, she knows where we are.\" Ginny's like, \"Oh, okay.\" So Eva leads us around (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">05:38). And she gets her Dippin' Dots. I get some Dippin' Dots, to try them out. And (inaudible 05:49) these are really strange. I don't like these. And Eva's like, \"Well, okay, I can finish them.\" So Eva gets two helpings of Dippin' Dots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">And we're walking back towards the gate to leave, and there's another ice cream novelty stand. She runs up to it. And I'm like, \"Oh, okay, she wants more ice cream.\" And Ginny (inaudible 06:05) she's like, \"You want more?\" Eva's like, \"Yeah.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, of course. We'll grab her another one or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">whatever.\" So she gets a SpongeBob Squarepants, like, ice cream novelty and she bites out the eyes, [which are like] (ph) gumballs. She's like, \"These are gumballs. [I'm just going to bite them] (ph) because they're frozen. They're not good for chewing.\" Yeah, I guess that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Yeah, we take her to afterwards, we're like, \"Yeah, we need to get dinner,\" you know. So it's like Ginny's like, \"I need to find Taco Bell.\" Because we stopped at Wendy's for lunch because that was one of Eva's favorite and one of my favorites. And so, we stopped there. And Ginny (inaudible 06:42). <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">She gets, like, a salad there. She's like, \"We're going to Taco Bell,\" because Ginny loves Taco Bell. I love Taco Bell. Eva loves Taco Bell. So we go for dinner. And Eva's got a really bad gluten allergy, so she really can't have gluten or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559999\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">And so I'm sitting there. Ginny, again, goes to the bathroom. And we're looking at the order. I'm look, \"Okay, do you know what you can eat here and what you can't?\" She's like, \"Well, you can look it up online.\" I'm like, \"I will.\" She's like, \"Yeah, you just go to the website and they'll show you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">which foods are gluten free or not.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay,\" so I look it up. And she's looking [with me] (ph). She's like, \"I can have that.\" I'm like, \"Great.\" She's like, \"And I like that.\" (inaudible 07:17) well let's get that then. And as we get food and sitting down, she's like, \"So I really like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200332\">hanging out with you guys.\" And I'm, like, (inaudible 07:27). She's like, \"This has been my favorite day ever.\" I'm like, \"That's great. (inaudible 07:30),\" you know. (Laughter) I'm like, \"Oh, that's great. Us too. We really enjoyed having you here.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">And (inaudible 07:38) she's like, \"This is nice.\" She's like, \"Usually, I have to share this with Dan,\" you know. And she's like, \"So...\" (inaudible 07:44) She's like, \"I'm definitely taking it home (inaudible 07:45).\" Yeah, that's a good idea. And, you know, she's just very real. She's a very real <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">human being. She understands what she wants. Her restraint in the gift shop was so good. She's like, \"Can we stop at the gift shop?\" I'm like, \"Of course we can take a look. I mean, we can go the gift shop, certainly.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">And so clever that (ph) she starts at the most expensive stuffed animals. She's like, \"Oh, look at this one. Oh, look at this one. Oh (inaudible 08:15). Oh, look at that. Look at this. Oh, it's amazing.\" And I'm eyeing the price tag, which is like 15 and 20 dollars. And I'm like, \"This is not worth <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">it. 20 dollars. [Oh my god] (ph),\" you know. And so she's looking around. She gets all the way to the end of the line where the smaller ones are. And she, like, takes a look at the price tag. (inaudible 08:36) And she starts going through all the lower priced items and lower priced items, still trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">to see if there's something that I will buy for her essentially (ph). (inaudible 08:47) this is interesting. (inaudible 08:50) cheap, plastic crap. She's like, \"Oh.\" I'm like, you can't even feign interest in that, you know. And then we get up to the counter, and she's looking up at the necklaces and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200373\">the bracelets and everything. And I'm like, \"Yeah.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Checking out the price tags?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, she's checking them out. I'm like, I can't buy her these things, you know. But at the same time, she didn't press, you know, and she didn't seem disappointed. She's like, \"Okay, I'm going to take a chance here. Like, maybe they'll buy me something, you know. But at the same time, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">are taking me to the zoo and they've paid for my lunch and everything.\" (Laughter) So she didn't press. She didn't press.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but then we went out and she saw there was a [turn stop] (ph). She was like, \"Oh, I want to do the [turn stop] (ph).\" We had already left. And I'm like, \"Well, maybe they'll let us back in.\" (inaudible 09:32) she wants to the [turn stop] (ph). And he was like, go through and go back (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">09:35) a little girl thing, all of a sudden, you know. She's so, like, oh yeah, restraint in the gift shop and advocating for her needs (inaudible 09:43) Dippin' Dots, as we discussed previously. This is the route we'll take and I can plan out the route. And I have problems I can fix, you know. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">\"I'm going to go on the playground, but you don't need to watch me.\" (inaudible 09:56) go on the slide. But other than that, you know, she kind of goes up there, goes through every single slide she wants to. She's like (inaudible 10:05). And then she's like, \"Yeah, I want to go through the [turn stop] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F3\">(ph), you know.\" Like, that's just so adorable. And yeah, you know. So that's interesting, that point that she's at, you know, between childhood and adolescent, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559999\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">THERAPIST: I mean, it sounds very different than the girl that wants to play house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: A baby (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: Exactly. Extremely different. Extremely, like, mature and, you know, [not necessarily] (ph) mature but, you know, a confident version of a ten-year-old, you know. Like, this is going to be a strong woman someday. I'm like, oh. And that's the thing that's amazing about young girls, right, seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">this woman they're going to become. (inaudible 10:59) with boys. Boys are like, oh yeah, this is what he's like. He's going to be kind of like that when he's older, you know. Whereas women seem to have a better journey. Become more complex as they go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: What boys are you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, you can more easily predict who they're going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What they are as a child is going to be similar -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it seems like that core stays similar. I mean, and then men are less complex, I think, [in many ways] (ph), which I think is a very different word than complicated. And I think that's important, the difference. Complicated, I think, is the connotation that things are difficult and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">must be gotten around, whereas complex simply means there are lots of parts to it (ph). Lots of detail. A lot of elements to it. So (inaudible 11:50) but, you know, just she had some suntan lotion in her eye. (inaudible 11:56) wipe that off for her. There's these little nurturing things, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F2\">And I'm like, that's really nice, because I would be such an amazing father. I'm just so good at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">But Ginny doesn't want kids and I don't want kids, you know. Like, spending the day with Eva, I'm like, \"This is great, but I don't want kids.\" I'm like, I'm glad we don't have kids because (ph) what I said before, you know. And it wasn't, I'm like, \"Oh, I'm so glad we don't have kids,\" because we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">having a wonderful time. I'm like, \"This is great.\" I'm like, \"But I'm glad we don't have kids because I don't want this every day, you know. I don't want every day.\" (inaudible 12:31) if she were my daughter, like, that would be it. That would be my entire world, to be focused on her. How do I help <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">her get through the entire thing and (ph) become this amazing person she can be? And she would be, like, my core project, in the way that I do projects, which is very, like, you know, stand back. Okay. Correct. Good. Off you go. I think, you know, (inaudible 12:55) controlling factor, you know. As (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200513\">sort of advising (ph) as one goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559999\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 13:06)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Well, I've got a lot of that, [don't I] (ph)?

It was just you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">and Ginny, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It's the two of you.

And apparently, right before I showed up, she told her mother, she's like, \"I'm really looking forward to this because when Uncle Fred comes over, he certainly spends quite a lot with the boys playing video games. I don't really get to see him alone.\" And I'm like, \"That's true. I do play <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">a lot of video games with the boys.\" That's because I love video games. (Laughter) You know, like, \"(inaudible 13:51) video games. Want to play too?\" I'm like, that's a good point though. So I'm glad we got to take her out by herself. And, yeah, I think we're going to do more of that because, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">we all think it was good for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: And, you know, (inaudible 14:11) to have, yeah, I think adults who will treat her like an intelligent, rational (ph) human being, you know. We have no baggage of, \"Oh, she's our little girl,\" you know. We don't have any of that like, \"Oh, she's still very young and fragile.\" Even with Dan and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">Gregory. I'm like, \"I suspect that you can keep yourselves alive. Step one, you will keep yourselves alive,\" you know. Like I'm -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: You have the confidence that they'd be able you have the confidence in them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I also watch. And sometimes, I'm surprised. Like, \"Oh, no. He would kill himself right there (inaudible 14:44). This will kill you.\" (inaudible 14:47) told you that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: And I could (inaudible 14:50), but I start with the assumption it's called the principle of charity. I start with the assumption that there's a rational basis behind what they're doing. And sometimes, there is, and that's when I'm surprised, and that's when I act, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Well, there might be. It just might be harder to find what the rational part is. I mean, there might be the you know, if they're playing with a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Well, rational based on the information I have at hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's (crosstalk 15:20). That's an important thing to remember. It's not stupid. You just don't know anything yet. I remember when Eva was about four. We were at, you know, (inaudible 15:35) when she was still married to [that rapist] (ph), Frank. She pisses me off [for never picking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">it up] (ph), but any case (inaudible 15:52). You know, trying to open some presents that we were all (inaudible 15:47) Christmas or something. (inaudible 15:48) I need a pair of scissors. I'm like, \"Eva, can you please run and get some scissors? \"She's like, \"Okay.\" And my mom was there. She's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">Bridget, he just told her to run and get scissors.\" And I'm like well, here's (ph) what. Eva comes jogging back with scissors. I'm like, \"Yes. She does not know not to run with scissors.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">(inaudible 16:06) slow down, slow down. And we're like, \"[We are careful] (ph) so we shouldn't run with scissors.\" She's like, \"Oh, okay.\" [I'm like, yeah] (ph). (Sighs) That was my first [of, like] (ph), ah, yes, basic self-preservation. In that case, that was surprising. (Laughter) You know. But still, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">you know, and I look at the way my father taught me. Still, you know, goes to a fireplace. Takes a piece of paper. He's like, \"Do you see this?\" I'm like, \"Yes.\" He throws it in. It goes (inaudible 16:36). He's like, \"That could happen to you, so don't touch that.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" Takes me to a box <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">fan. Takes a pencil. Turns it on high. He's like, \"Look at this.\" Sticks it in. Wham (ph). \"That could happen to your finger, so don't do that.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" It's a very simple way. These are the consequences (inaudible 16:53). Be aware. Noted (ph). Thank you, father. You know. (Laughter) Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200733\">this is when I'd just started walking. From the time I was, like, probably one-ish. (inaudible 17:04) start walking. I spoke very early. I remember understanding words, like, very early. As early as six months, is what I'm told, the timestamp of my very first memory. Yeah. I have a number of clear, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200734\">intimate (ph) memories, still, from those days.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559999\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: What is it?

I could see through that. (inaudible 17:39) crawl around. I remember crawling under the table, because that's how I got around. [They were looking at] (ph) television, and I could still see it's a football game, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">I didn't know what it was. I was like, \"That's interesting,\" you know. I remember my father (inaudible 17:56) back, sitting (ph) on a bike ride. He puts me in a bike seat, and I remember seeing the back of her, and the sky was blue. And then we moved for a bit, and then she stops. And she's (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200772\">18:09), you know, we have a flat tire, so we have to go back. But there's such an incredible feeling [happening sort of before that] (ph), you know. (inaudible 18:22) because I could see my mother, you know. (inaudible 18:25) It's so simple, you know. It's a simple thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: Simple but everything (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. All-encompassing. But I remember I knew what her words meant. I remember her words, you know, and I knew what they meant. And I didn't speak yet, you know. But I know what she meant.

Further, the heart has an electromagnetic field, which it generates, which is also true and easily measurable. And that this field affects the brain activity of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB2\">people near you, right, and vice versa. So our hearts affect each other's thoughts and (inaudible 27:50), which makes sense (inaudible 27:52) feeling a vibe. Like, oh it's a bad vibe.

Does your heart predict the future? (inaudible 29:35) the neuroscience of consciousness, which says that we are behind. We're lagging behind. And so isn't it possible that our hearts perception is faster than our brain's perception? And so, that it isn't a <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D91\">prediction of the future, so much as it is sending a signal before we realize what we've seen. Is that possible? I don't know. Maybe. Or does your heart predict the future? Is the fact that the universe exists (inaudible 30:03) that collapses (inaudible 30:06), in some way interacting with the electromagnetic <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D92\">field of your heart. Does your heart understand the changes in that field moments before they're about to happen? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I think our minds are set up to have us experience things within a certain kind of at a certain pace, which (crosstalk 30:28).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Right, because consciousness is many, many layers of neurons firing in different types of (inaudible 30:37). So (inaudible 30:39), right. And so, who knows? I mean, that could easily be the case. It's not that the heart is predicting the future. It's that your heart knows (ph) before you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD1\">know it. (Pause) That (ph) matter is about to change or it could maybe protect that matter (inaudible 30:57) before your brain realizes that the matter the wave has collapsed, you know. That's the universe.

What's outside the universe? Well, one good <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF1\">guess right now is other universes. Weinstein's new theory of everything. (inaudible 31:44) Dan Weinstein. He's got a new theory of everything (inaudible 31:48) okay, like, this feels right. Like, we need to continue to test this. Like, really, it feels right. Because it fixes some problems with the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF2\">standard model, right. Specifically the dark matter problems, dark (ph) energy. Comes down to, as I understand the basic rudiments of this theory, it's that dark matter is actually a fundamental force. Essentially the opposite of gravity, right. Of course, gravity pulls the matter together. Dark matter <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF3\">(inaudible 32:28) force pushes space apart, right, you know. So the universe continues to expand and the universe continues to accelerate [in its] (ph) expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">This is this should be fascinating to anyone.

He's now saying that there's probably 250 dimensions. So it's significant more than we are capable of getting our heads around. You know (inaudible 33:33) we understand 25 percent of reality. That's not a lot, you know. But significantly <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E12\">less now. (inaudible 33:44) so, like, 76 percent (inaudible 33:49) percent. It might be as low as six percent. Or .6 percent. (inaudible 33:55) It's incredibly small, the amount of reality you understand, right. Even if they're wrong, there's only 16 dimensions, incredibly small, the amount of reality <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E13\">we understand. And even the reality that we're seeing, we don't yet fully understand. How did it get here? What was before the Big Bang?

And they want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F1\">fake a moon landing. (inaudible 37:58) First, they need to find a film crew and make sure we bribe them (inaudible 38:02) for life. That's very important. And [the sultan's] (ph) like, \"All right, and we'll have to build a giant space ship.\" They're like, \"Why?\" She's like, \"Well, when they ask you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F2\">how did we get to the moon, we'll say in a Chinese space ship (inaudible 38:15),\" you know.

I'm like, you'd have to [beyond a space ship] (ph), so why not <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F3\">just build one and go (inaudible 38:30). (Laughter) That's the joke. (inaudible 38:34) why don't we just actually (inaudible 38:35). It might just be cheaper just to go to the moon, you know, than to build a space ship and hire a film crew and, like, bribe them all to silence forever. Yeah, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20111\">Yeah. That's the world we live in. (inaudible 38:56) Eva's amazing. The universe is incredible. Hardwired for cooperation. Deer. (inaudible 39:05) first in deer and in schools of fish and in flocks of birds (inaudible 39:09). The idea was there are three watering holes within range of this deer (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201111\">39:19). And every day, they choose which watering hole to go to. And it depends on where they are, what's the distance, where are predators likely to be. You know, what time is it? How fast can you travel with the old ones, you know. How soon you have to get there. The sort of little ones (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201112\">39:37). And this is, you know, a pretty big decision with a lot of factors every day. But they all move at once to go to the same place. Somehow (ph) they decide. They're like, well, probably the alpha deer. He's like, \"We're going this way.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20110-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20110-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559999\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20113\">So they studied them. They studied them for some time. What they discover instead is that, at a certain point of the day, the deer start looking different directions. They noted the deer are looking in the direction of a specific water hole, right. They're all, like, \"I'm looking at that one. I'm looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201131\">at that one.\" Here's the 51st percent. [They say that] (ph) 51 percent of the herd is pointing one direction, they would all just go. (inaudible 40:14) So democracy. The same thing we found in flocks of birds, is they essentially communicate just nonverbally (inaudible 40:27) agreement, you know. (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201132\">40:30) schools of fish -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what is the signs of (inaudible 40:33)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20117\">CLIENT: Right. And they're like, they're hardwired for cooperation. So they say democracy is nature. Democracy is the base. So that's good. They spent centuries trying to fight that though, you know. And a lot of people still have this mental illness, really believe they can make it on their own or <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201171\">they don't need the rest of (inaudible 40:59). It's idiocy to think otherwise. You have to really know a great deal of facts to believe that. And so that comes out of ignorance (inaudible 41:11) they describe it as (inaudible 41:15) call that an actual infective mental illness that can be spread, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201172\">know.

Well, I was thinking too about your point about cooperation [to survive] (ph) is that it's this I was thinking about this kind of thing with Eva, was that it seemed to me that it was maybe it's kind of a bit of a paradox, but it seems (inaudible 42:07) true that her independence <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201251\">came from her being able to depend on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20127\">CLIENT: Sure. Well yeah, it's true. Independence doesn't happen (inaudible 42:18) necessarily, right. I mean, we need to play at being independent, you know. That's what was happening there.

I hover over very small children, but as soon as they get even slightly capable of (crosstalk <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2012F1\">43:07). Yeah. I remember when Dan was first walking. I was like, following him around. And we walked toward the street. And I would stop and I'd pick him up, turn him around, and let him go, you know. That was it. (inaudible 43:19) that way.

The most powerful words she could have figured out growing up, in that bloodline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20141\">THERAPIST: I don't have to fall. (Laughter) That's right. Ha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20143\">CLIENT: Fucking brilliant. So, yeah. So I just watched (inaudible 47:58) necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, I guess it makes me think of how much well, it makes me think of two things. One is that you'll have these realizations every once in a while. It reminds me of the realizations you'll have of, like, you just getting some bad information (inaudible 48:17), you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201451\">the moths. (Laughter) And you always happen to be that person, that person that you were to Eva. To yourself though. To yourself, to kind of go, \"That's crazy,\" or \"That's \" And, you know, sometimes there wasn't anybody to go no one has an encyclopedia with a moth around (inaudible 48:40).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20147\">CLIENT: (inaudible 48:40) I can fix these things for you already, you know. That's insane. And she picked it up very quickly. (inaudible 48:48) freaking out and having one of her things. And (pause) she's concerned after grandma leaves. So she goes to Eva. She's like, \"So, grandma can be pretty loud <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201471\">sometimes, huh?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, loud and crazy.\" (Scoffs) (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20149\">THERAPIST: She got it. She got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2014B\">CLIENT: Good (ph). That's important. So yeah, so [I won't have] (ph) kids because I don't want them and because [it coin flips] (ph). They get bipolar and (inaudible 49:23). And first off, I would say, \"You shouldn't just inflict life on someone,\" you know. (inaudible 49:34) have kids and you make a <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2014B1\">choice. You're going to exist now. You didn't ask for it, but now you do. And it's going to be joy but also perhaps horrible suffering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2014D\">THERAPIST: You didn't have any choice. You were thrust into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2014F\">CLIENT: And now you exist. And by the way, (inaudible 49:50) bipolar. Let's flip a coin. Let's find out. Bridget's kids, [only one of the first three] (ph). Pretty convinced Dan -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20151\">THERAPIST: Dan, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20153\">CLIENT: Or he's a sociopath. I'm going with bipolar because sociopath is (pause) well, that'll be a problem, if we get there, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What's your concern about the sociopath?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20157\">CLIENT: I wonder what I would have become if no one had been there to beat empathy into me, you know. (inaudible 50:26) forced me to really spend time understanding other people and their motivations, you know. What would I have become? I was very smart from a very young age. [Self-interested] (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201571\">and angry. Bipolar. What would I have become? I don't know. I don't know. Possibly something scary, you know. It's hard to say. But then, there he is. He has no abuse. No one's abusing him. He understands that words have power. He understands threatening people with a gun has power. He doesn't seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201572\">to understand or care about what other people are going through. And that could just be childhood. That can certainly be middle child syndrome. Bipolar child. All the same. He definitely exhibits those qualities. [Who knows] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20156-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20156-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559999\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20159\">THERAPIST: Is he kind of an excitable kid, or is he very calm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2015B\">CLIENT: It depends. When he gets something new, when someone shows up (inaudible 51:48) give him something, he's extremely effusive and happy and excited. But then, once that thing is used up, he gets very sad. And there can be and he'll cry (inaudible 52:06) almost immediately. And he wants very <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2015B1\">direct control (inaudible 52:13). He's like, \"These things are mine, and I will make the choices in regards [to these things] (ph). He's very pleased (ph). Like, \"Well, that is up to me,\" you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Is he into, like, harming animals and stuff like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2015F\">CLIENT: That's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20161\">THERAPIST: Lighting fires?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20163\">CLIENT: Unclear (ph). He doesn't like fires. He has attacked his siblings a number of times, but stuff like grabbing their cheeks and just twisting, you know. I mean, just anger. [That's just anger] (ph). So yeah, he hasn't hurt any animals yet or set any fires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20165\">THERAPIST: Those are the big ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah, those are the clear signs, you know. So my thinking, he's probably just bipolar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yeah. If he gets, like, kind of excited by cruelty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2016B\">CLIENT: Oh, I see. No, that happens when he's furious (inaudible 53:01) [so that's cool] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Well, all right. So, Thursday.
