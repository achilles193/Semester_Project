Though he (inaudible at 00:00:35) and couldn\u2019t talk, so I sent him an e-mail and (inaudible at 00:00:38) a little bit about Jeremy, including his preferred times. I have somebody else in mind if Gavin doesn\u2019t pan out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: What is Gavin\u2019s last name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Harrison (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: He has a website?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I think. And we can more about that but (inaudible at 00:01:10) for scheduling. So this week I don\u2019t have anything as of now, tomorrow or Wednesday. The following few weeks, at least two or three, I know I will have something late in the day on Wednesday. That\u2019ll be good.

Why did you smile when you brought it up? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Because it made me think of your e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: And? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m inclined to both make light of and take very seriously at the same time. I don\u2019t mean make light of in a defensive (ph) way but like, \u201cOh Darren. I had this thing I just remembered, I have to e-mail you about.\u201d But I know it\u2019s also very serious because I know keeping a contact <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">like that is very important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Like instead of coming in today and talking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Instead of thinking (ph) about it when we met on Friday or talking about it today or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: No and no. (Laughs) I didn\u2019t know about it when we met on Friday. It came at the end of a long meditation and it was a meditation stopping thought that I then sat through but it completely changed my whole\u2014it felt like it changed my life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: The meditation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: The thought. The idea that I should see you more in the short term. Or that I want to. (inaudible at 00:05:14) Like the idea that I want to contact you about it and that\u2019s okay was something that I was able to sit with for about six minutes until I wrote to you. (Chuckles) But it came at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">end of this \u2013and I (inaudible at 00:05:43) something like this since Thursday. Saying (ph) a lot. Like a lot a day. Well every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">Yesterday was our like, they were like the flight attendant. They were like, \u201cGoodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.\u201d It\u2019s so nice. It\u2019s really, really incredible, and it\u2019s making me see that like all thoughts about you aren\u2019t bad for me and so when I\u2019m (ph) a really good \u2013someone\u2019ll just make me smile and I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">just smile at them. And the same is true for thoughts about my work and lab and Kelly. Like if I slowed down enough to actually see what they are and how they come up and how they make me feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">A lot of them I could just do without and it\u2019s like fine if they\u2019re there but it\u2019s also fine if they go and then some of them it\u2019s like, \u201cWell. This is also going to be fine when it goes, but it kind of makes me smile.\u201d And then once in a while, I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s a moment of something shifting that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">I take action on but that\u2019s only happened like two times in four days out of what feels like hundreds and hundreds of potentially actionable things that I just let go. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562310\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess I think a part of what you\u2019re doing is trying to convince both of us that (pause)\u2014I guess I still sort of think a lot of it was there\u2019s a big distance between Friday morning and Monday morning, and you want to reach out. And I think for a few reasons, you don\u2019t like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: That I want to reach out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I think I don\u2019t like what my options are. I don\u2019t think I hate so much anymore that I want to reach out. I think it\u2019s pretty sweet (ph). But yeah, I feel pretty trapped with the thought because I feel like I only have certain types of things that I can reach out about that you will reply to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">one. And certain kinds of replies at all are the ones that I\u2019m going to get from you. So I guess it\u2019s not only about reaching out but it\u2019s about being replied to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess\u2014a little concerned that it\u2019s going to sound like I\u2019m chiding you which I\u2019m not intending to do, but when you say like, \u201cThis is [nowhere in my life right when we met] (ph) it was only after this -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t! (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m [not done] (ph). (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Kelly hadn\u2019t even written back to me Friday morning. What was on my mind Friday morning was what I [inaudible at 00:12:05] back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Which I entirely believe. I was just saying this to think about conscience (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t in my mind any more Friday morning than it is every day. Do you agree with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: My hypothesis is that it was in your mind and it was unconscious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Differently from Thursday afternoon or like any other day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: My hunch is that it came up -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: What are we talking about anyway? What was the (inaudible at 00:12:58)? Reaching out? [Really wanted] (ph) to ask you a specific question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I think you came up with a very reasonable sounding reason\u2014to reach out when you wanted to reach out. And [how do I say this what I think] (ph). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s (ph) bad. I\u2019m not saying you did something wrong, but I am saying a lot of your explanation is you\u2019re just, \u201cWell, the reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">I realized it then is because of all these other things that were going on. And actually, even I had this one thought that I wanted to do but I had five hundred thoughts that I didn\u2019t feel the need to do anything about it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Which is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t get it. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m making my point clearly. I can think about it a little more. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: No. You\u2019re making it clear. I\u2019m not hearing it yet. (Pause) [I just haven\u2019t let it go yet] (ph). Arguing with you about it. (Pause) Is that why you think you haven\u2019t made your point clearly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: No. Okay. So I said, \u201cI think when you wanted to reach out or felt (inaudible at 00:15:24) about the distance over the weekend, you came up with the reasonable sounding reason to reach out.\u201d And then, I think, as we\u2019re talking about it now, you\u2019re explaining\u2014it feels to me as though you are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">explaining why this was really about having the reasonable sounding reason. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: And in the moment I felt like that too, and like all along and not just like coming up with it now. Maybe you\u2019re right. This is how I\u2019ve explained it to myself in the whole time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and to me there is a bit of a feel of like trying to convince both of us that this was not mostly about wanting to reach out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562310\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s slightly different. I think it was mostly about realizing that the next, whenever it is, like two days, the next Monday to Thursday separation and then realizing about how the next separations felt too big and too overwhelming and too bad in the face of everything else that\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">on. I can\u2019t handle that so I need to do something about it now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I don\u2019t think it was about only\u2014I can\u2019t handle this in this moment, like this separation, so I need to do something about it now. I think it was like much of what I\u2019ve been thinking (ph) about was the future, and whether I\u2019m going to be able to get through it. Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">(Pause) So, do you agree?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know yet. (Pause) I (inaudible at 00:19:00) you were sort of asking my help for something you felt very anxious about and anticipated in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe in the present too. Maybe I also didn\u2019t like the idea of the whole weekend. I guess what occurred to me was, \u201cOh, this would feel much better now it has so many spaces between our session.\u201d So I could do something about that. That\u2019s how it kind of felt in the moment. And that\u2019s how <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">I\u2019ve been explaining it to myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">Like, I don\u2019t like this space, I don\u2019t like any of the upcoming spaces, it\u2019s too much. So in reaching out, I will not have that much space and the act of reaching out and it\u2019s exciting to have something to reach out about. And something shifted, where I have never wanted to ask for more time\u2014 and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">felt kind of empowered or something. I haven\u2019t felt that before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">You look like you think I\u2019m full of shit (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) I was just (ph) watching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Okay.(Pause) (inaudible at 00:21:13) how you look?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) I would say it\u2019s very clear to me that\u2019s how I look to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m self-conscious. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does seem to me like you\u2019re anxious about discovering you\u2019ve been caught. I\u2019m not saying -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I mean, I\u2019m anxious about discovering something I stole, like don\u2019t quite feel at the service for me. Like I still feel like I want to believe what I told you, but I hear you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">Also, I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re not going to try hard to honor my request. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I told her what I really think about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to meet more. I think it\u2019s important to talk about why I asked.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">I think I\u2019m very afraid of that. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I guess I think part of what \u2013I think what\u2019s very scary there is that I\u2019d be making a decision in some way that had no transparency and to which you had no access. I\u2019m not saying that to you. I\u2019m not actually even saying that I think you\u2019re full of shit but you think I think that. And you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">think I\u2019m making a decision based on that [and kind of] (ph) remove them from what we can really talk about, which I can imagine very frightening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">(inaudible at 00:26:15) in some ways it\u2019s even more true actually, if the way I originally thought about it is right. But either way, it\u2019s terribly important to you and very sensitive about your wanting more time and struggling with this phase. Yet I am pushing you [way over that] (ph). Since I\u2019m also <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">silencing (ph) you, I think that\u2019s part of it.

It\u2019s like I\u2019ve juggled my breath between Monday and Thursday. [I think] (ph) can\u2019t breathe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think you\u2019re right. I think \u201cmiss\u201d is not the right word. I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s (inaudible at 00:32:21), but I think \u201cmiss\u201d is a little too mature. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. \u201cMiss\u201d implies\u2014you know, like I miss my dad sometimes. But I don\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cMiss\u201d is what will happen when I\u2014\u201dmiss\u201d might be the right word someday, but it\u2019s not the right word now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. This is much more anxious and disorienting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and like it\u2019s too close, too much attachment, too much clinging. Yeah. Too much anxiety about the separation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I would guess in a way, it\u2019s more like it misses when there are two separate cold people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Right. And when the space between the people is \u2013like when I can sort of acknowledge it and know that [Kelly noticed quite large sometimes] (ph) and all that\u2019s okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t miss the ground when you\u2019re falling through space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah, or like you don\u2019t miss the atmosphere when your helmet comes off. (Pause) But it\u2019s confusing why it isn\u2019t so grounding because this isn\u2019t grounding. I mean, it is in one sense because you are here with and for me and you care about me and you know me (inaudible at 00:35:21). <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">It\u2019s not a particularly anxiety free time. There\u2019s plenty of anxiety that comes up here. Maybe it\u2019s the way in which it comes up and the way it gets held [that is grounded] (ph). I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">It\u2019s also one of those things, I think I\u2019ve like decided or incapable of shifting to finding other sources of air or like it\u2019s too hard with everything else that\u2019s going on. Like it could be different but I feel like I would have to (pause) like really, really commit and some way that feels too consuming <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">to make the shift. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m talking about why it could be different. I guess I feel some pressure for it to be different.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">I don\u2019t know why [I\u2019m feeling] (ph) the pressure. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s scary how it is?  (Pause) And I imagine, for a few different reasons. Among that I sometimes, as in earlier this hour, don\u2019t get that this is the main thing that you\u2019re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Why don\u2019t you get it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well, (inaudible at 00:41:23) I don\u2019t get it, but we\u2019re talking about it in a way that feels, I think, more distant. Like [right now] (ph) I guess I\u2019m thinking about when we [throwing out] (ph) how these different views on why you\u2019re reaching out and kind of \u2013I imagine it feels like, it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">sort of missed the point of this desires (ph) that you\u2019re feeling. I\u2019m not intending to say that it\u2019s useless and there\u2019s nothing to talking about it, I\u2019m just saying I imagine it felt kind of [better removed] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562310\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Well, less about the anxiety that I was feeling, the way that you were interpreting it. And I guess yeah, it felt like (pause) (inaudible at 00:42:39). That there wasn\u2019t (ph) enough suffer around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You just haven\u2019t (inaudible at 00:43:03)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: (Pause) I guess [it\u2019s kind of a turn off] (ph) that Gavin has a website. (Pause) I don\u2019t know about the self-promotion(ness). But I don\u2019t know him and he\u2019s not for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">Is he a meditator?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:44:35)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m having trouble with the way in which Jeremy\u2019s potential therapist might be different from you, and therefore inferior. Like it\u2019s not going to work or he\u2019s not going to be good enough. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I see. Should (ph) we stop here? I will let you know if I find someone [tomorrow or Wednesday] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Thanks. Can you get me the receipt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Totally forgot about the meeting (ph). Yeah. Did I write something down about it and [then can\u2019t do it] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019m sorry I forgot. Or did you send me something about it?
