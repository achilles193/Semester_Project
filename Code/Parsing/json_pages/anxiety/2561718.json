(laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I wonder how that got there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: (laughing) Oh man. So I think because of that I\u2019ve started having like crazy dreams because I kept like \u2013 I was kind of asleep but I wasn\u2019t. You know what I mean? I ran over some old dude with a car or my cousin did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (laughing) I don\u2019t know. I think I was with my cousin, Bobby, I think. I don\u2019t know where we were, why, what, who these other people were. There was some old dude. No idea who it was and Bobby like He was trying to get us or something or get Bobby; I don\u2019t know what. And he made a U-turn, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">then he just went straight at the guy and pinned him against a parked car. And \u2013 yeah, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what that was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Then I was driving a lot. I was trying to take pictures. The sky was really beautiful and my camera, my I-phone camera wouldn\u2019t work. So, there\u2019s like freeways that I kept \u2013 because I didn\u2019t know what they were so I kept getting \u2013 feeling like I\u2019m going in the wrong direction. (yawning)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Oh man! But yeah, I \u2013 She\u2019s a little spoiled brat. Today she was really \u2013 I was \u2013 Yeah. Discombobulated. Especially the hair-licking. That\u2019s really weird. I don\u2019t mind when she\u2019s \u2013 I love her, but that feels really weird when a cat\u2019s licking your hair. (laughing) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So, yesterday I talked with the SBA about getting a micro-loan for my business. I figured I don\u2019t have a storefront but I do have some start-up costs. So, they were really nice after I wrote to them and I was like, \u201cThis is what\u2019s going \u2013\u201d \u2013 very detailed. And I was like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been a grad <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">student for a while so my credit\u2019s not great but it\u2019s being repaired\u201d but I don\u2019t want that to stop me from starting a business. I was like, \u201cI do need the space to meet with clients and I do need some marketing collateral or whatever.\u201d They called me like immediately. Very nice. I don\u2019t know. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">referred me to this Southeastern something Massachusetts. I think it\u2019s kind of a non-profit investment thing (inaudible at 00:03:29) Middlesex County. I don\u2019t know. So we\u2019ll see. That\u2019s pretty good. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">Again, it\u2019s one of those deals where it\u2019s \u2013 two grand, three grand, five grand, it\u2019s not a lot of money. It\u2019s just frustrating. (laughing) You know what I mean? It\u2019s just like, \u201cCome on.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And then, the one other thing I did; I was like, \u201cWhat a minute. If I get that credit card, that means I can probably get another one like that card.\u201d And you don\u2019t want to be applying to a million cards, of course, but, you know, two cards, three cards, whatever. So, I don\u2019t know, I did that as well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">We\u2019ll see what happens. Because I was like, \u201cAt least I\u2019ll have $600 worth of credit cards.\u201d (laughing) Anyway\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">So, I\u2019m trying to be savvy. I\u2019m thinking. And I called my friend, Devin (sp), who\u2019s \u2013 He\u2019s younger than me. He kind of got into buying houses and now he\u2019s started a painting company and all that. I\u2019m going to talk to him. He\u2019s really savvy. And he\u2019s \u2013 you know, he\u2019s young. He might know \u2013 I\u2019m just going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">to be like, \u201cLook man, how did you put the money together? What tips can you give me for someone?\u201d I have a freaking house.

And why was Bobby driving? I think \u2013 And why were we in my mom\u2019s old Dodge, what was that? It was like a Dodge K. You know those square Dodge \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you remember those. She had a white one of those for quite a while. No idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Bobby was driving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Bobby was driving, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re in the passenger seat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. And the guy didn\u2019t die. I think even later in the dream, or something like that, we were somewhere where he was still. And like we knew that he was \u2013 Bobby wasn\u2019t trying to kill him anymore. But, I don\u2019t know. That was weird. And I don\u2019t know who these fucking people were. No idea. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">know what that neighborhood was. I didn\u2019t know \u2013 Same with when I was driving freeways and trying to take pictures. I had no idea. I was feeling very confused. There were all these on-ramps and off-ramps <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">Although, now, having a flashback, do you know how like \u2013 You know what\u2019s happening to me lately, which is a little bit disconcerting and also fascinating at the same time? When you start feeling like you\u2019ve seen dreams before. You know what I\u2019m saying? So it\u2019s like a deja vu of dreams, because now <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">I\u2019m remembering \u2013 I guess; I think I saw this dream that, another time \u2013 not last night \u2013 that I was driving and I drove through some town and then I decided to like drive way out west. I mean I don\u2019t know what these places were; I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s what it abstractly felt like. I don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">that was. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: A lot about driving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s true; there is a lot about driving. There\u2019s been a lot of travel in my dreams, right? The one where I was on the boats \u2013 A lot of change, new directions \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Going on a journey \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that\u2019s why none of them have been scary. In fact, even last night\u2019s \u2013 Even hitting that guy \u2013 For some reason I didn\u2019t feel one way or the other particularly emotional or something. I was only frustrated that my camera wouldn\u2019t work to take a picture of the sky. I couldn\u2019t figure out <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">why the camera-phone wouldn\u2019t work and then I was a little frustrated because when I was driving and I kept not knowing what on-ramp or off-ramp I was on \u2013 But it wasn\u2019t like one of those other dreams where I\u2019m like What are they called? \u2013 Like really stressed. Like stress dreams.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Sounds a little bit like your feelings about where you are with this profession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s a lot of, you know, a lot of change going on \u2013 New directions and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: and things you don\u2019t know a lot of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. Unknown, nervous, you know, unknown stuff But yet also it\u2019s like you can taste it. If I really stop to think about it, all it\u2019s going to take are maybe like two little things. Maybe they\u2019re not that little, but they\u2019re kind of little in terms of the logic of being able to do these things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">And really my life\u2019s going to be very different. You know what I mean? Imagine if I suddenly had some clients or if I can buy another house. That would be \u2013 To me that would be just as amazing as publishing the book or putting out records except it would be on a more practical \u2013 in terms of day-to-day <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">living. It would totally change a lot of things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561718\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Like something that has some longevity. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Right, right. And also, more and more, it would be the ultimate symbolic and real kind of break from my family. There\u2019s no other way this is \u2013 For me to continue feeling as good as I am, there has to be a real break. It can\u2019t just be like up here.

I really felt like an observer. I was like, \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d (laughing) And the fact that it was Bobby \u2013 He didn\u2019t seem particularly upset or \u2013 He just did it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It was more matter-of-fact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was very matter-of-fact. And the other thing was that the guy didn\u2019t seem particularly threatening. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">I hooked up with that Kristen chick yesterday, which now I kind of regret it.

All that stuff. Yeah. (pause) But I think I\u2019m going to take a different tack. I think with her I\u2019m just going to tell her. I think she already \u2013 She was kind of half joking but half serious that like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not a slut.

And she was half joking that, \u201cWell, you know this is all you want anyway,\u201d or something like that. So I don\u2019t want her to feel bad. I don\u2019t know. I think I just need to tell her that I\u2019m just like \u2013 There\u2019s just a lot \u2013 I\u2019m overwhelmed and I\u2019m \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: that you don\u2019t want to date her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Not really, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You did want to hook up with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Or I thought \u2013 There\u2019s also just the reality that someone seems more attractive to you and then you kind of get to know them when you spend more time <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">with them and then you \u2013 You know. There\u2019s some of that too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">And like I said, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 That circle of people \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to get too deep into that and then \u2013 Everybody\u2019s fucking talking and \u2013 you know.

You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: No, I don\u2019t know.

But because I\u2019m for whatever \u2013 Not for whatever reason but I think a lot of \u2013 I feel this need to just really have a real \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: sustained emotional contact<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I\u2019m just so sick of this shit. You know what I mean? It just seems absurd. It\u2019s kind of like what I\u2019m saying about the house and the \u2013 It\u2019s really for someone like me \u2013 I\u2019m not saying I should have some amazing relationship, but this is ridiculous. When I look back on it I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">\u201cCome on!\u201d Like I know lots of fucking idiots who have just a regular girlfriend who they see after work and they go to a movie or they go to a bar. I\u2019ve not had that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t fallen for those people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, that\u2019s partly it but partly I\u2019ve gone for the wrong (pause) \u2013 Yeah, I don\u2019t know what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean.

I thought you were saying there have been people who have wanted that and I have rejected them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Do you think that hasn\u2019t been the case that side of things? I mean that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying, but you think that hasn\u2019t been the case, that there have been people who have wanted that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: No, there have been people that wanted it, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. They\u2019ve been \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have been with those people to begin with. I knew that it wasn\u2019t going to be that and yet, it kind of wasn\u2019t fair. I kind of let them think that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">The trick part is that so then, what\u2019s going on? Why am I not \u2013 Is it that I\u2019m still \u2013 Is it because I\u2019m not putting myself really \u2013 even though I think I am, I\u2019m not. Do you know what I mean? I don\u2019t go to a lot of shows anymore. I don\u2019t go to \u2013 I\u2019m really not out there a lot. That\u2019s one. Or when I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">out, do I not anymore approach the women I want to approach, so then I end up kind of ?

There\u2019s some of this stuff that\u2019s \u2013 (pause). I\u2019m still shy on some level and now, it\u2019s not even about shy. Now it\u2019s just about \u2013 because now I kind of don\u2019t care on some level in a good way. But that can hinder you from making effort with people that might be more intimidating <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">or make you a little nervous or whatever. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">The closest I got was with the yoga chick. That one, I don\u2019t really regret it, but that was one that I could have been very \u2013 She had her own place. I had my own place. We\u2019re around the same age. You know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re really getting hungry for a kind of sustained emotional contact with someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Totally. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Not just a one-night stand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: No. Yeah. Also because I know enough \u2013 My family is healthy enough that I do see how especially with mom \u2013 not with my other \u2013 but with my mom and dad \u2013 and actually with my uncle Anan (sp)\u2014that, you know, she might be a (inaudible at 00:21:56) and I don\u2019t even know how romantically whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">\u2013 But just as a partnership, you know. When I\u2019ve had girlfriends, I can\u2019t tell you how good it\u2019s felt when I\u2019ve had girlfriends who are like, \u201cYeah, you should do this with your business!\u201d That\u2019s such a good feeling. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Just being supportive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah supportive and having ideas and you know \u2013 (pause) Even the chicks I sleep with have been like that. They\u2019re nice people; it\u2019s just when you know it\u2019s not a long-term thing it makes it even sadder in a way. You\u2019re like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice that you care about my business. (laughing) Too <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">bad we\u2019re not going to \u2013\u201dBut, yeah, it does get harder. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">The yoga chick was 40 and she didn\u2019t want to fucking have \u2013 She almost didn\u2019t even sound like she wanted to be monogamous. You remember I couldn\u2019t tell what the fuck was \u2013 I don\u2019t know, people become more of who they are as they get into their 30s and stuff. Either they\u2019re desperate to have a child, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">which is a turn-off or they already have them or they\u2019re content and they don\u2019t want kids.
