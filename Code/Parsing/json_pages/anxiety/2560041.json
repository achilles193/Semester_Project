(LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: And I'm thinking, \"Really? That's it?\" So I don't want to discover it. I don't want to actually open it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: It's like, \"No.\" Whatever is going on with me is going to require many shelves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Ah, yeah. Many shelves. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Many shelves over thousands of years of like people really thinking deeply about things, because that's where we are. Right? It seems... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">It's kind of a snapshot with what... It's almost like a snapshot of what people think about as opposed to a snapshot of actually what's really and actually insightful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. It feels like a, like a collection of Cosmopolitan (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So here's the thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: We have been painting and all of that. I've been painting. I've been doing lots of stuff. And all the while, not, me not looking for work, which has been going on forever, me not looking for work. So then, on Wednesday morning, I get a phone call. But I don't recognize the number so I left to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">voice-mail. But I listen to the message later, a few hours later. And it's asking me to go in for an interview to a (ph) high school for biology. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">But here's the thing. I've never applied. (LAUGHTER) I have not applied to anything. I have no idea how they got my resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Where is this high school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Dorchester (ph). As it happens, (inaudible at 00:02:15) first public high school in the United States.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Oh. I didn't know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: But that's a historical footnote because the fact is that it's a completely inner city, on the verge of being a complete disaster school and it's not in its original site. So it's not august like in Waltham (ph). It's not this converted. It's been there for probably thirty years in its current <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">location. It's a converted, sort of added onto this factory. So it's kind of a new building-ish, circa thirty, forty years ago. So when you walk inside, it's all primary colors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">Like there's a blue floor, the green floor, the yellow floor, the red floor. Right? And it's all just sort of cinder block and it's completely (inaudible at 00:03:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Great place, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Great place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Did you apply there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: That's the thing. Right? So when I applied when I was actually... (PAUSE) Yes. So when I applied to Shrewsbury (ph), I applied to Red Bank and I was offered a biology position at Red Bank but also at Shrewsbury. I chose Shrewsbury because I liked the headmaster at Shrewsbury and also Shrewsbury, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">it seemed, even though it's a massive, massive complex, it felt more spacious, whereas Red Bank... And somehow, also there was this, there was sort of this do good feeling. Like it felt like there were all these things they were wanting me to do in addition to being a teacher. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: At Red Bank?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: At Red Bank. That's how it felt. And there was this principal who... At the time, I did not know this. I found this out... Like because it felt sort of military like, the school. It turns out he was in the military. He was Portuguese. You know, he's gone. So anyway, fast forward. So Wednesday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">I get this call and I'm thinking, \"I've never replied to anything.\" (LAUGHTER) So I'm thinking, \"Well, maybe they found my resume from five years ago or something like that.\" So I call back and I said, \"I'm happy to interview. I'm delighted. But I honestly did apply. So I don't know how you got my resume.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">She said, \"Well, let me double check.\" And she said, \"Brandon Remmington (ph)?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" \"Yes. Nine o'clock tomorrow morning if you want to come in.\" And I said, \"Sure. I'll be there.\" Alright. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560041\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">So I thought, \"Well, this is interesting. This is totally backwards, you know, as opposed to applying for a job. You simply get a call.\" And I'm thinking, like, part of me feeling this, \"This is kind of it,\" and also feeling this feeling of real sort of relief and serendipity, thinking, \"Oh, the big <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">road block to a job is like the whole looking, looking, looking, applying, going online and filling out these long applications.\" Now it's like the whole point of that is to get an interview. (inaudible at 00:05:39) Perfect. That's easy. I love it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: So I... (PAUSE) So my mindset was, you know... I had my normal dress clothes from when I teach but I needed some new dress shoes. I will literally put my best foot forward. Alright? So I will get some dress shoes (inaudible at 00:06:11) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">I didn't have time to send my shirts off to the cleaner. Even though I had plenty of dress shirts, they're all blue and grey and pink and sort of boring. And, since it's a billion degrees and I've got the air conditioning not working, you have to wear white shirts and if you sweat, they'll see it. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">my white shirt, I (inaudible at 00:06:33) wash it and I'll actually iron it. So I did that. I'm thinking, \"So, I'm all ready.\" And I go in and I'm waiting. Of course, I'm taking notes, right, in terms of... Like the day before, I went to the website looking at Red Bank and sort of... But not too hard. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">This is easy. Right? Because there's no stress. It's not like I applied. It's just like... Whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">I thought, \"I should actually look at the website and familiarize myself with what's going on.\" And then, it's not like I haven't been thinking about teaching in terms of my theory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: So... And then I'm reading this book about math and so I think, \"Oh, that's a good idea.\" So I'm writing down little notes just to have buzz words in my mind. I have just the amount of coffee. I show up. It's air conditioned so I'm able to wear my jacket and I feel like I'm looking good. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">what I'm doing. She comes out, the headmaster. I go in. And for an hour it was just this terrific interaction. And she was just... It was a feeling of like, you know (inaudible at 00:07:55) And, you know, first...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I've never had an interview that long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Oh. Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... It usually is sort of like a half hour. The interview was really a half hour. And then after that, it was just sort of us talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: It turns out, she happens to be the headmaster but she also wears two hats because she's the assistant superintendent. She's in charge of all high schools in Waltham.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560041\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: But... And so the deal is Red Bank... And sort of this is it's last chance. This is like... So, on a scale of one to five, five being the absolute worst, there are five schools in Waltham that are a four and there are a couple that are five. Red Bank is a five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: So basically, if they can't turn around this year, the oldest school in the United States, public school, that's it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: They'll turn the charter. This is the last chance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Is it based on what? Like MCAT (ph) scores or something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: There's various metrics. But, yeah, that's it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: So this is the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: So here's the thing. So I felt like, you know, I really liked her. I felt like she liked me and I... While I'm doing it, I'm doing it with the idea of, the idea of teaching. Right? So I was very genuine in my responses and it felt like... I felt like the responses I was giving were the right <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">ones, in the sense that she responded very favorably. Then when she started outlining her goals for the school, it's like, \"Oh that happens to be in sync with what I just said.\" You know. And I asked her about being superintendent and the superintendent was stepping down and all the politics... (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">at 00:09:57) like what it means to be in charge of all the high schools. That's a big thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">And then she was showing me around the high school (inaudible) So then, I'm walking around. I actually walk into a classroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: And all of the sudden, not exactly PTSD but pretty close. (LAUGHTER) That feeling of like, \"Oh boy.\" And then leaving one classroom and going to another, there are these two black kids and the guy who was showing me around who's the... He's called the dean of culture. He's this, I'm sure (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">at 00:10:41) summer time. He was wearing basketball high tops. He's a black guy. So high tops, shorts, T shirt... You know, I would not have thought he was a dean in demeanor and look. But he is. And so it's good I didn't assume he was not. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">I said, \"Oh, what do you teach?\" He said, \"Well, I'm actually the dean of culture.\" Which I... Basically, I think that means (PAUSE) provide discipline, et cetera.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: It's not culture as in go to the opera.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:11:21) (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Exactly, exactly. Handy dandy (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: So there's these two black kids and he like lays into them and, of course, they're insolent. Right? And they talk back. And I'm like, \"That's it. That's what I can't stand.\" It's like you always have a kid or two like that in your classroom. It's like I don't want to do this. I don't want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">do it. I do not want to do it. Here I have this fabulous interview. I like her. I like the idea of teaching. But seeing that classroom and seeing these two punks... So, of course, you know, I speak favorably and it's nice and laughs and blah, blah, blah. It's perfectly fine. So it's a normal cinderblock <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F2\">school. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">And so I go and I get in the car and I have this feeling of like, \"Well...\" Part of me feels like, \"This was easy.\" I feel like I am likely to get the job. Right? And there's a feeling of relief (inaudible at 00:12:27) She said, you know... She said... She said, \"So...\" She said, \"You actually have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">to apply for the job.\" I said, \"To be honest, I have no idea how to even do that.\" She says, \"Well, you go to this website and you fill this out.\" (PAUSE) So... Alright. This is completely backwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560041\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Which... So then, I get home and then I... You know, of course it's hot. So I go into the bedroom where it's air conditioned and I take off my clothes and... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">You know, I put on shorts and then I call home and I tell my dad like I have mixed feelings like all of the sudden. It's like, \"I think I might get this and yet I haven't taught in a while and the idea of being inner city...\" So he was sympathetic to that but in his mind essentially is it's a job which <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">I totally get and this coming from a person who, as sensitive as he is, he's done a lot of work for much of his life that he did not like because he needed to do it to support a family and I have deep respect for that and I can't know what that's like, what he has done. So he passes the phone to my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">mom because they have the air conditioner and the air conditioner guy's there. Many things were going on. There was the bug guy coming. All the sudden, various people were showing up at the house. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">So he had to go tend to the air conditioning guy. So my mom's talking and I explain this to her. And she said... She says, \"I bet you're hoping they don't offer you a job.\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" She said, \"I understand.\" She goes... And she goes, \"It wouldn't be bad if they offered you the job to turn <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">it down. You don't have to do that.\" She goes, \"I know...\" She said, \"Your dad doesn't know it. But I know what it's like, how difficult and all-consuming and demanding and stressful it is.\" And she said, \"Is it possible that a job like that...\" She goes, \"It's not how good you are. But it's how much <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200892\">you can put up with. It's that sort of job.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">I said, \"Yeah.\" She said... She goes, \"You want to educate and you feel like you are up there completely exposed as a baby sitter of people who are big enough and angry enough and to always catch you off guard because they're not kids. They're fourteen, fifteen, sixteen and they're smart enough to screw <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">you up.\" I said, \"Exactly.\" (PAUSE) Anyway, so that was that. I thought, \"Well, I guess I should actually look about how to apply.\" So I go to the website and I'm like, \"This is painless.\" I said, \"I don't know why I didn't do this before. This is easy.\" Right? I mean... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And you do it, is it for the whole city?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: The whole city. Right. So you go and you create a user name, you create a password, you upload a resume, you click on jobs, you fill out your little profile. It's really not difficult. So anyway, this is sort of this activating thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: That's the silver lining in all of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Well, actually, more than the silver lining. It's a huge thing. (inaudible at 00:16:25) So all of the sudden, the reality of possibly having a job put the fear of God in me and it made me realize that I need to figure out an alternative. (LAUGHTER) Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: That's what it made me realize. Like I've got to figure out what the hell I want to do because if I get offered this job, morally I feel like I have to take it. Morally, because I feel like Barbara (ph) does this very difficult job and doesn't like it. And it's like who am I to reject a job <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">when I absolutely need a job even though I know... I mean, it's not the end of the world either way. Right? It's not... You know, I know that I can tell myself (inaudible at 00:17:05) I'm thinking about this much more than the kids are going to think about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560041\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">I'm thinking about it more than the superintendent's going to think about it or the headmaster is thinking about this. I'm thinking about this a lot more because I know what it's like to be in a classroom and I know how stressful it is and I know how infuriating and exhausting and uncertain it is. Right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">There's no control, it feels. There's no control and yet I am the symbol of (inaudible at 00:17:37) Right? There's no one holding your hand. There's not like anybody helping you teach. You're it. You show up on day one and you have to know everything. New school, new everything. There's a whole new <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D2\">system because the school's on, like, you know... It's under scrutiny. There's a whole new way of doing things. So you have to like have... Your lesson plan has got to be down to the minute so that when kids need to come back, they know exactly where you are. That's not how I operate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">I... (PAUSE) There's a lot of administrative stuff that I don't like that is going to be expected. I'm thinking if I was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Like normally, you walk into a classroom, you have a general idea of (inaudible at 00:18:25) and you teach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: There's a little more to it than that. But you have a mental plan and you have things that you create. But here you have things that every day, there's something and it's sort of like this, you know, over fifty minutes, sort of every ten minutes what you're going to be hitting. I have no clue. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">Who knows? I mean, that's hard enough to do with a completely well behaved lecture hall where no one raises their hands, let alone a whack a mole (ph) situation where you've got behaviors popping up left and right...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: ...where you're also trying to, you know, explain (inaudible at 00:19:05) to people who don't speak English. (PAUSE) Anyway, so I went on, I filled out the thing, I sent her my... I have like actually generate references. So I found my old references and modified them and made them... I sent <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">them. I e-mailed them to her. And then I went on BPS (ph) and I'm looking around and I'm thinking, \"Physics teacher?\" I'm thinking, \"Yeah. Not at Red Bank.\" (LAUGHTER) I don't want to get anything at Red Bank. And then I thought...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Why? The physics position was also at Red Bank?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: No. It wasn't. But I saw physics and I thought, if it's just another high school. It's in WPS. The only school in WPS that we have students who are actually capable of learning...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Greek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: ...is Greek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: And that's on the other end of the extreme because they're all... You know, it's essentially this fancy private school. It's free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What do you think... Do you think you would like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Here's the thing. Right? That's also irritating.

What...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: You know, kids that are not motivated and are angry, one on one, you can figure out. When you have a whole group of them, you can't... You have to somehow manage all behavior so that everyone is capable of working. Right? So you can't... You have to be instantly quick and right in order to settle <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">down group dynamics and it is... (PAUSE) It feels impossible because you're not going to have kids on any given day who are... (PAUSE) They just put their head down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">Maybe for a good reason. They're homeless. They haven't eaten. They're tired. Maybe they... It's their fifth class. They can't read. They're tired from not being able to read and being yelled at and they're just shutting down. So kids put their head down for good reasons often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right? And yet, the fact is, you can't have a kid put their head down. Right? Administrator walks in, you can't be teaching at Red Bank with kids having their heads down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Right? So you're letting that kid take a nap?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, you have to bear so much. It really is something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: So you've got to play this game. It's like... So, yeah, you've got to... Somehow while you're teaching biology, you have to somehow say, \"I know you're really tired. If you could just look at the board.\" But that might be inflammatory, in which case, all of the sudden, it's this big thing and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">meanwhile you've got to be teaching. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: So what do I want? Right? Because it's not teaching biology at Red Bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Although, and I... She said she would contact me on Friday. So cell phone in the pocket on vibrate and I'm feeling like... Part of me feels like I don't want to be offered the job because then I don't have the... I don't have the moral (inaudible at 00:22:29) because I am going to feel morally <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">for Barbara, like to turn down a full time fully benefit job... But the part of me feels like if I'm not offered the job and the interview went really well, then what's that say about me. So it's two sides to this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You want to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:22:55) or decide, \"Well, I need a job. I don't like it. I know what it's like. It stresses me out. I'm going to want to not do it. I'm going to have to prepare. All of the sudden, the month of August is going to be feeling like, 'Oh shit.'\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Knowing what you're kind of going into battle...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Knowing... It is. It's a battle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: So anyway, it's Friday. Right? And... (PAUSE) Anyway, so there's that. So then... I go onto WPS, right, looking at these various jobs. And there's jobs that are interesting but I'm not qualified for and I know I'm not qualified for and I don't feel too badly for it. Like Waltham Greek needs <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">a head of the math department and I know how bad one particular math teacher is because I've been dealing with this math teacher for half of the year because (inaudible at 00:24:01) has her and she's just arbitrarily...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Right? So I know that Greek needs some revamping. In fact, Ashley (ph), (inaudible) mom, she sent me the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: She found out about the job. She sent it and there's this whole Greek parents group and they're like, \"We've got to solve this problem because math sucks at Greek. We have to find somebody.\" So I was given... Ashley e-mailed me (inaudible at 00:24:25) But I didn't look at it. I just saw it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">thought, \"Oh, I'm not qualified.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560041\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Just not qualified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: I looked at it and thought, \"That's interesting. I'm flattered that they think I can do it...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: \"...because I can't even pass the math intel (ph).\" I can't even teach math.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: So, anyway, so then I am looking through the various jobs and then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Would you want to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: Well, if I were... Yes, absolutely. The problem is I'm... (PAUSE) I'm not quite math (ph) enough yet. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">I mean, to be, you know in charge of math at a place like that, you would have to have taught math for a while, which I have not. And that means something. Not just in terms of credentials and experience but, in real terms, I mean, it's one thing to study math and think about math. But it's another <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB1\">thing to really know it well enough to teach it. So I presume that if you're going to be head there, you should have taught all different types of math, including AP Calculus. Right? You have to really know and have taught math to be in charge of all people who are teaching math. And yet, I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB2\">I could be a real sort of (LAUGHTER) advisor in some way. Right? I feel like I could be some sort of math consultant like... It's like (inaudible at 00:25:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Right? So there's not that particular job. Anyway, so I'm looking around and jobs and so the (inaudible at 00:26:03) So for people who have aged out of regular high school but still want to finish their diploma, they can go at night to this (inaudible) at Shrewsbury. That's where the academy...(inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">at 00:26:27) It's all connected. And so it's a stipend position. You teach Tuesday and Thursday nights, math. It looks like part time teaching math, get my feet wet teaching math, love it. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: Cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: I could still go to school. I could teach so I actually learn math a bit better. I could be making money that's stable. I could then segue that into something else full time until I actually finish this master's math.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: And you've got more or less people that are wanting to be there, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: No one's twisting their arm. They don't have to go to school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Exactly. But so I... You know, there's five sort of mathy positions, some part time, some full time. So I click click click click click, you know, and I submit, submit, submit. And, of course, here's a thing, \"Do you have the license?\" Well, I don't have a license in math. I just have the license <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">in biology. So, of course, you know, there's a feeling of, \"Maybe I don't have...\" They're not even going to look at me because I'm not licensed in mathematics. (PAUSE) Which I don't feel too badly about. But I feel like, you know, it would be better if I were. That would be handy because I have (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B2\">at 00:27:41) study for this math test.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: How is that... What's the test like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: How much preparation do you need?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: I feel like, yeah, I really need to devote a couple months because I feel like I've got lots of gaps in my math knowledge. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560041\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">And also you've got to be fast. Right? So... (PAUSE) I don't know. Like it's not the GRE. The GRE seems like... I don't know. Somehow that seems completely straight forward and fun. Right? It didn't seem hard. This is like... And the biology intel, right, that was like (inaudible at 00:28:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">CLIENT: So fine. But I don't think of myself as being someone who really is naturally good at math.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">CLIENT: I think it's because I've gone to later on where it just hasn't... I don't have that (inaudible) And also, it's like I look at a problem and I can sort of sort it out. But it's always like me looking... I don't like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">Maybe it seems I should not teach the GRE mathematics (ph) which I don't want to. You know, you think about high school algebra class and you think of... Like all the various rules for, you know, second degree and third degree polynomial and how you do synthetic division and all these things you learn <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F1\">in algebra which I... In the context of calculus or some other class, I sort of think, \"Oh,\" sort of like, \"Oh, I wish I knew that sort of algebra.\" And then I sort of sort it out. Like I play around and I do, do, do, do, do and eventually, I do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">It's not like I look at it... It's not like I'm an algebra whiz. I do it. You know, you have to. Right? There's an adage saying, \"You need people to take calculus so they'll actually learn algebra.\" Which is true. You spend so much time doing the algebra with calculus. But anyway, I find no joy in like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201211\">the very quick high school version of algebra where you sort of look and you think, \"Oh, it's a third degree polynomial. Woo hoo!\" I don't think that way and I don't care it's a third degree. I just look at it and think, \"Well, alright. This is what you've got to do and blah, blah, blah,\" for some other <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201212\">purpose which is to actually solve some other problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Not to do some third degree for its own sake. Anyway, bottom line is to take the math test to become a math teacher means to do a lot of problems very quickly that are the sort of problems a way that you can actually be teaching. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it's not like you're doing abstract algebra or teaching philosophy of mathematics and writing essays and thinking about math. No. It's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Computation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: It's just computation, computation, computation, computation, computation. And that's not what I'm good at. Although, GRE that's fine. Right? GRE, it's not that hard. But that's not what this is. Right? This is actually for math teachers. So I need to somehow get into this sort of, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">MCAT (ph) mode. I'm like, \"This is a lot of information. I've got to be fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.\" And I really just go nuts. Like being competitive and being fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Is it that kind of dull or is it that it raises some anxiety about what that means to be fast\/good at it or not? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, there is the anxiety of... There is the anxiety of... (PAUSE) ...feeling like something that I know should be relatively simple because it's a high school algebra thing. I don't find to be simple at all. And yet I know that I know much more than that and I know if I look at it long <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">enough, I'll figure it out.

Right? You know, it's like an equation. When I see one, I know what to do with it. But the language of it... Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">So I have to tell myself, \"Okay. It's called quadratic. In Latin quadra means square.

That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201371\">the feeling of quadratic even though I know... But it brings me no joy. Quadratic is just like... It really. (LAUGHTER) It's the first year of high school, right? Or eighth grade.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: And actually, if it wasn't called that, if it wasn't called quadratic, I would look at it and think, \"Huh.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: That's interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: If there was a story along with it, then like (inaudible at 00:34:01) and play with it and draw a little picture and draw a little square.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: It's the same thing you described... I mean, it goes all the way back to that story of learning the days of the week (LAUGHTER) like the arbitrariness of it and you playing around with it in some way. \"Why does it need to go in this order?\" It's so strikingly similar and it also just... There's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201411\">something so much in like the meaning of, \"You're supposed to get it this way.\" The anxiety that was raised at that time and still today about like quadratic, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it's so... And this feeling you had back then of, \"Why don't I get it this way? Why doesn't my brain kind of go, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201412\">'Okay. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and that will work and you don't think about it.'\" Something to that. And it's powerful. It just really does. It kind of makes you question your...

It's breaking into pieces and getting all these nails and there's tons and tons and tons of this stuff. There's bags that I'm putting these in and I'm waiting for the trash man to come.

So the next week I'll paint. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">And later on in the day, I'm ruminating and I talk to Ethan about this stuff and he appreciates this and he tells me, \"You know, I've Never told anybody this.\" He goes, \"My last year at Francesca (ph)...\" He said, \"Every morning, I would cry for ten minutes.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: Oh gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: \"And then I would go.\" He said, \"You can't go back to teaching.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah.

He's a geologist and she's a geologist. She said, \"Yeah, my first year teaching, every day on the way home, I'd cry.\" What is it about this? You're staring out adolescents who are a reminder... Like they are this... What's implied is you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">teaching young minds and somehow they are the future and you look at them and what's implied and what's sort of under the radar is that these angry people are going to outlive you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">You're expending your own life energy for no clear gain because they're not caring and, in fact, they're making your own present life more difficult. So it's like... It's not like the sacrifice of a parent for a child. No. It's thirty strangers and their own parents don't care. No one cares. Right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D1\">So there's that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">(CROSSTALK)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: You can't heal it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: You can't heal it.

We're in a hurry. But next time. Thank you.\" They left and I'm feeling like, \"I'm being a good guy. People appreciate my help. I clean my garage. I didn't get stung.

And so we'll go out around five and they'll have beer and wine and chips. So it's nice. It's this nice thing. I really like them a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20189\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:41:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">CLIENT: So Marlene (ph) is a...

Right? She has her route and she hikes. Right? She hikes. So she's in really good shape. So she walks all day for her job and then on the weekends she like goes and climbs mountains. That's what she does. Evelyn is taller. She bikes to work. She's a biologist. So she does research <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019B1\">on epithelial (ph) cells. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D\">She was out yesterday around 5:00 reading a book.

If I get offered <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D1\">this job, Barbara can't know that I got offered the job because I cannot reject the job. (PAUSE) Anyway, so I say, you know, I said, \"You being in a lab it's monastic. Right? You have... You work with colleagues and that's an essential part. But you have sustained periods of time, an hour, two hours, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D2\">maybe more a day and then this adds up over the course of a week or a month where you can think deeply about something and there's a long term problem that you're considering.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F\">And I said, \"To teach biology in high school is exactly the opposite.\" And I said, \"You know, what you do...\" I said, \"Existentially, epistemologically, maybe even metaphysically what you do sits in some doubt. Right? You don't know what you don't know. You're using a body of knowledge that you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F1\">you know, that people generally agree upon but aren't completely certain about and you're trying to sort things out. Whereas, in a biology book, a fourteen year old looks at it or a college student looks at it because it's a survey course and the person can go throughout college and have this experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F2\">and will after, the feeling of, 'This is written by experts. I am not an expert. I will never be an expert. This is the complete body of knowledge. I will never know this and so there are experts.
