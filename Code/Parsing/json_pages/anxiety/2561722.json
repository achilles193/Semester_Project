It\u2019s been a crazy, crazy week, but it was good. Yeah, like, I a bunch of, like, logistical shit happened that kind of threw things off track, but, yeah. So yeah, I\u2019m pretty tired actually. But on Monday (laughter), I had, like, a seriously scary moment where I got pulled over <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">by a state (inaudible 00:42). And I\u2019d had, like, two or three beers, you know. I was fine. But still, I\u2019m just completely freaking out inside. Turns out my registration had expired. I still don\u2019t know how this happened. I mean, I have insurance. I have my emissions sticker. I literally don\u2019t know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">the fuck happened. I don\u2019t know if it just slipped my mind. I\u2019ve been away so long and I wasn\u2019t driving. But I totally I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what the fuck I was thinking. So that was really scary, because I didn\u2019t, you know. So that was, you know, kind of late at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">But so he had to tow the car. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t let you drive,\u201d you know. So on the one hand, I was relieved (laughter) that that\u2019s all that happened, but, you know. So yeah, it was a financial. Then my car had coolant issues, so I had to have it repaired. It was just a fucking nightmare. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">That being said, it could have been, you know somehow these things didn\u2019t trigger things in me, so that was good. I just dealt with it. I had to kind of borrow some money, which I didn\u2019t want to do, but, you know, when you\u2019re forced, you\u2019re forced. I mean, I just couldn\u2019t. Between fixing my car, getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">my car out of the tow lot, I mean, it was just like all this shit happened. But, you know, luckily, my friends are amazing and they helped out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">So then it was like, all right, well, do I cancel my trip, you know? But then I was like, but I fucking paid for the hotel. Now it\u2019s non-refundable because it\u2019s, like, the day that I\u2019m going to you know what I mean? So I ended up again, I got a little bit lucky, but I found in Cheshire, there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">a very small car rental. It\u2019s not a chain, you know. So I got, like, a really cheap rental. It was, like, 120 bucks, you know, for three days. I was like, you know what, there\u2019s nothing I can do. The car needs to be repaired, and if I don\u2019t go because of all these things, that could be a trigger, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">know. I\u2019m going to feel like all this shit conspired, and then I allowed it to make me feel kind of defeated and negative, and so, to blow off this trip that I was planning, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">So I went, and it was good. It was fine. It was fun, you know. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It was good. Like, I was even thinking about it on the way there, on the way back, while I was there. It\u2019s so crazy to me now that I never feel the kind of anxiety or panic I used to feel. Do you know what I mean? I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">like, I\u2019m, like, walking around in Pittsburgh. Like, these are the kind of things that would trigger, do you know what I mean? Total weird sensory overload. Different kind of environment. I just felt very good, I guess, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And Uma was really cool. She\u2019s a really cool person. It was really fun. And even that was good. Like, it was I think she\u2019s a pretty healthy like, you know, we fooled around a lot and stuff, but we didn\u2019t have sex, you know, and I thought that was kind of cool, like, you know. Like, we just hung <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">out and (pause) we even, like, had a talk about it. And we were like, \u201cWell, you know, it\u2019d be really hard to date long distance, but maybe we can try. But we won\u2019t put any pressure on it. Just see what, you know.\u201d Like, I don\u2019t know. It was very we just had a great time, you know. And it really served <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">its purpose. I did feel nice. It did feel good to kind of just get away and just, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">So yeah, but yeah, it was a lot. It was a long week. It sucks to ask people to help you. I mean, really, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Once I asked my friends, they were like, \u201cOh my god, yeah. What, three hundred bucks? Man, of course.\u201d It\u2019s just another motivator, you know, in terms of money and all that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">you know. (Pause) Right now, that\u2019s my main, you know. So the business is really on my mind. I\u2019ve been doing more and more research, you know. Like, I got to figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">I\u2019m going to tweak my website. I think I shouldn\u2019t list the hourly rate. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. A lot of people don\u2019t even know what coaching is, you know what I mean? So I think why are they going to (inaudible 05:45) hundred and whatever bucks an hour? What is it exactly? You know, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">I don\u2019t want to do that. That\u2019s one. And then I really do need to figure out kind of the niche. I need to list a couple of things that are really my because the more I\u2019ve been reading, there are a lot of life coaches. It\u2019s a really big, growing business right now. And I have no doubt that I can be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">successful, I just I\u2019d rather it happen sooner than later. Businesses take a long time to get going. I\u2019d rather do things the right way off the bat and try to draw, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">So yeah, I got some books, so I did some research on what the good books are. Because I think I have to just start, you know. I have to just start somewhere, you know. But yeah, that\u2019s my main focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: [I wonder right now] (ph) what comes up for you here around money. I know that\u2019s hard to talk about here too, but I realize that you have often acknowledge it\u2019s hard to talk about, but I don\u2019t know, like, what your internal process is like around paying for this right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: What do you mean? In general?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like, do you think about it? If you forget a check, like last week, is that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course it bothers me. Yeah, yeah. No, it\u2019s always in my mind, yeah. Yeah, it bothers me. Sometimes what happens is I\u2019m like, you know, I just feel better if I delay it till it\u2019s closer to when I\u2019m going to get my next unemployment check, so I just feel at least that in case, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">Yeah, of course I think about it. I mean, you know. (Crosstalk 07:36) It\u2019s like sometimes I think different things. Sometimes I think like, \u201cWow, it\u2019s a lot of money. Like, 240 a month.\u201d Then I think, well, actually, no, it\u2019s not a lot of money, because that\u2019s not even the average rate for I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">I see (inaudible 07:48) all the time. I don\u2019t pay 240. That\u2019s actually really, really cheap. So then I feel good about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">I mean, it just bums me out that I have to think about it at all. That\u2019s, I would say so now, it\u2019s not about here. It\u2019s about all of this stuff. It bothers me that I can\u2019t either just fix my car without an issue, without being stressed about it. Or that, you know, I have to drive a 2000, that I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">just get a slightly newer car, you know. It\u2019s a bigger issue about money right now, do you know what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s not just about here [or there] (ph), because this is amazing. I mean, are you kidding me? I mean, you know, one of my friends told me, like, \u201cHow have you seen this person for this long? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">Or if she\u2019s so amazing -\u201d Like, well, because I\u2019m fucking lucky and she\u2019s, you know, compassionate and she has a system where she\u2019s able to, for some of her, you know, unlike I feel very fortunate, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">So you know what I mean? So it\u2019s like a mixed bag. Like, 240 is 240, you know what I mean? Right? (Laughter) It is a lot of money, but I also know how essential this is, you know what I mean. I just get bumped out sometimes when I feel like some weeks more than others I\u2019m stripped. You know, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B1\">but again, that\u2019s across the board. I feel that way about my insurance or my, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: So last week when you I\u2019m just trying to put together when you say you\u2019re thinking about it all the time. Not only here you\u2019re saying everywhere. And then you forgot to bring a check. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t forget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s [on your list] (ph) because, like, waiting for the check to come in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I was like, \u201cI owe her anyway on Friday.\u201d So I was like, I\u2019d rather just pay her then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: For last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: And then, you know, just, yeah. I mean, I\u2019m always kind of behind, you know what I mean? Because I feel like then, I get screwed by the bank fees. Because it\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re going to cash it whenever you\u2019re going to cash it, you know what I mean. So at least it\u2019s closer to when I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">that there\u2019s money. I don\u2019t know. So yeah, no, I don\u2019t forget it I just have to strategize how to, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Maybe that would be easier than. Like, it could be one check a month, where you know do you know what I mean? Like, if it were one check for 240 right when you got paid, and you (inaudible 10:31) that week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. I could try it that way, yeah. But again, see, then that depends. Like, is that the week that also my insurance is going to be taken out or my loan to my uncle? You know, it\u2019s all this fucking shit that I have to, you know. But yeah, maybe. Yeah. That could be good too. That way, it\u2019s just done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I think I was just worried about, you know, doing the bill for this month. The balance had tipped above a thousand dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Did it? Fuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Just because this month -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve missed a couple, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Last week, and then there was one at the beginning of the month. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: All right then, you know what I\u2019ll do, is then I\u2019ll (pause) since I think I can swing it in this next week or two, I\u2019ll try to pay, like, a bigger chunk next week as well. Yeah. Fuck. I didn\u2019t realize -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: I mean, it\u2019s atypical for me to allow it go on that long. Usually, you know, it\u2019s got to be ready (ph) into the following month. I know things have been really hard. It\u2019s been based on need. But I also think it\u2019s important to talk about it. I actually think it gets easier -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Sure, sure. No, no. it\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: if then it\u2019s above ground and then, you know, you don\u2019t have to feel like, it\u2019s not, like an elephant in the room anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s fine. Okay, then I\u2019ll yeah, I\u2019ll try to make some dents in it over the next week or two. That way -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: I think the most important part, especially just keeping up so it doesn\u2019t get any worse. But that, I mean, you bought a check today, so (inaudible 12:04) that may even have kept it the same than what the check was for (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I\u2019ll try to see, it\u2019s like these things. Like, if the car thing hadn\u2019t happened. I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s always -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Ordinary life (crosstalk 12:19)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, ordinary life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: keep money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: So when you\u2019re basically broke, it\u2019s just it becomes really hard. But regardless, I\u2019ll yeah. Yeah, I think next week I can make a dent. (Pause) Yeah. And now, I\u2019m even thinking maybe I won\u2019t even go to this other bachelor party, my friend\u2019s party in San Diego. I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">you know. I mean, I\u2019m going to stay at his house, so I don\u2019t have to pay to stay anywhere, but even just going out and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s like to not do that, because at one level, you know you don\u2019t have the money. Then also, it\u2019s like sitting with that reality is so it sounds like it just feels so bleak and low.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, it just feels like I mean, because basically, then I feel like, well, why that bachelor party? Really, I shouldn\u2019t be doing anything then. If this is all about that, then it\u2019s the weekend, for example. I should do absolutely nothing, you know. I should just stay home and, you know, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">just stay home. I mean, you know, where do you draw the you know, where do you save yourself from just going into, like, a fucking depression because you\u2019re, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: And on the flip side, where do you save yourself from going into a kind of denial, like, pretending there is money, until it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I\u2019ve been good that way. I mean, it\u2019s just the one, this one stupid trip was the one thing I\u2019ve done. Like, I\u2019ve not done anything. So I think I\u2019ve been good, but you can be good but still life can happen, you know. I had it all planned out. I had it budgeted out, and then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">you know. So, yeah. You know, I really, you know, this business, nothing business is going to change nothing overnight, but it has to get started. Like, I need to, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Need to what? What are the next steps to [start up] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Well, I need to I\u2019m doing more serious research now, like, instead of a general, like, Google type, looking at people\u2019s websites. I found out, like, what the best books are that are, like, you know, not these books that are like, you know, how to grow your coaching business to be a million <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">dollar, you know. Not that kind of shit. But, like, I just got a book that looks really. It\u2019s really about, like, you know, what about liability? What about, you know. Or what kind of clients exactly are you you can\u2019t just say you\u2019re a coach. Like, it\u2019s so competitive now. You really need to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">out what kind of practice do you want. What kind of clients do you want to see? And then how do you make that happen, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">And they talk a lot about how, you know, coaches, there\u2019s the big thing. It\u2019s not just saying you\u2019re a you know, when you\u2019re a psychologist, people know what that is. With coaches, you have this double duty of, like, kind of explaining what the fuck you do, and then creating a market for that. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">all things I know I can do. It\u2019s good to get more concrete info, you know. You know, the fact is a lot of coaches don\u2019t make it, or they do make it, but they need to do other things as well. They just don\u2019t make enough money. For whatever reason, I feel very confident that I really can do well. I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">to figure out how to it\u2019s almost like I need coaching first, you know what I mean? Like, I need to figure out what are my how to utilize my strengths in the best way, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">So yeah, so the website needs a little tweaking, I think, a little bit. I\u2019m going to have a blog, you know. One of my best skills is writing, so I\u2019m going to have a blog where just little, you know. You lost your job, now what? You know, (laughter) things I can speak to, you know. Delayed grief. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">know. Just things that I can, you know. And then, I don\u2019t know. Yeah, and then we\u2019ll see. So I just have to get it out there and just start, somehow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Have you set any deadline for yourself?

You know what I mean? I mean, I doubt that I\u2019ll get a client next week, but I want to announce it next week, be like, \u201cLook, let\u2019s get the word out, what\u2019s going on.\u201d I\u2019ll have, like, one or two blog posts people can read, you know. I\u2019ll tweak <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">my bio a little bit. I think it should be a more bullet you know what I mean? It\u2019s a nice bio. Everyone likes it, but I think I do need to, that part, my specialization. And, like, just a, you know, published author, you know. Graduate school. Teacher. Public speaker. Whatever. Like, I just need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">make sure people understand what my strong points are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the shrug (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: No, you know, just that it\u2019s daunting. I mean, it\u2019s just, you know. I am a little nervous, you know. This is going to take time, I think, to get off the ground. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s a big deal. Yeah, yeah. And also, that means it can be an amazing deal, do you know what I mean? It\u2019s just going to take time, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s all new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m just hoping, you know, while I have this unemployment it\u2019s just such a good opportunity to work on yourself and you know what I mean? So I\u2019m hoping that I don\u2019t need to make a lot of money, but if it was just enough that, okay, even if I don\u2019t have the unemployment how, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">my business is like, you feel like you\u2019re on the right trajectory. Like, oh yeah, this is a growing business. We\u2019re getting there, you know. Even if it\u2019s not a lot of money, you know, luckily, with my living I don\u2019t need a lot.

No, I mean, how could you not be nervous? I mean, you\u2019re starting (laughter), you know. Plus the kind of family I you know, I try not to talk to them much about it, but they\u2019re supportive. But they kind of don\u2019t get it, kind of. You know? My uncle doesn\u2019t get it, I think, kind of. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">think he gets it. You know, they\u2019re just so they\u2019re so practically minded. They\u2019re so, like and I think, also, they\u2019re just, unfortunately, it\u2019s the way they see me, I think. I mean, I\u2019m sure on some level they think, \u201cWho are you to give like, what advice (laughter) are you going to give some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D2\">business person, like, a real business?\u201d You know what I mean?

No, no. I feel the opposite. [In fact] (ph), are you kidding me? (Laughter) How much time do you have? I mean, I think I have a lot to offer people. A lot, you know. (Pause) Yeah, no, I\u2019m not worried about that. And the reason I think I\u2019m going to be good at it is because, unlike <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">them, I don\u2019t give a shit. Like, you know, if I\u2019m coaching someone who\u2019s like a zillionaire or something, I\u2019m not I think the reason it\u2019s going to work is because I\u2019m not going to kiss their ass.

Why would they come to you specifically?\u201d You know. How do you know they\u2019re not going to want their money back, you know? (Laughter) My uncle is like, \u201cWhat if they want their you know, what if they feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200992\">like it wasn\u2019t what they wanted, and they don\u2019t feel any progress?

It\u2019s something you have to kind of sort out.

I think for them it\u2019s hard to imagine that you can just I mean, that\u2019s what I just told them. I was very blunt.

They \u2018re not, like, a PhD in literature or something. Their training is just that they decided to write and they wrote and wrote and wrote and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB1\">wrote and wrote, and now they\u2019re successful. Now they\u2019re suddenly an expert. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s also years of building expertise, right, and working on the craft before they actually get something published. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, but my argument would be that, I mean, I\u2019ve been teaching. I\u2019ve been studying literature. I\u2019ve been writing. I\u2019ve been doing things. I\u2019ve been here. I\u2019ve been doing things that are non-stop studies of human behavior, non-stop. So that\u2019s on top of my accomplishments. You know, ivy <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">league school. Publishing a book. Things that I\u2019ve put my mind to that I\u2019ve succeeded when, really, I shouldn\u2019t have, in some ways, you know. My context was fighting against everything I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m sorry, but the more I look around me, I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re certified or not. All <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF2\">you have is that certification. I don\u2019t see anything else that is some kind of amazing background. You had the money to go get certified. You got certified.

I mean, in that way, it is unusual, in that way. But perfect. I mean, if you feel that you have a calling for it, if you feel confident, great. Then it works out. You know. I mean, I don\u2019t know. My understanding of psychology is, you know, back in the day, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">a lot of psychologists were not particularly degreed or whatever. I mean, they studied a lot and they read a lot, and then they had right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You have to have a license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: No, no.

You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, I feel like it was just this brand new field that people just read and read and read, and they studied, and they started to get their hands wet by doing things. And then they went and maybe got a degree or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">But, you know, I kind of see it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: That life coaching\u2019s in that sort of (crosstalk 25:01).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I need to get clients, so that as I get the clients, then I can take a course here, you know. I can slowly, you know. That\u2019s easy enough to do. So it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C11\">that you don\u2019t need all that stuff it\u2019s just that I think I\u2019m fortunate in that I have such a wacky background that almost seems like a perfect fit, do you know what I mean?

And people have backgrounds that mean that they\u2019ve been used to that work, right. A lot of people starting (ph) graduate school have been in <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">therapy for ten years already. But that they still need the training.

I mean, me too. Absolutely. There\u2019s no easy way around that, unfortunately, you know. So I have to take this, like, circuitous way to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">THERAPIST: And the field is such that it sounds like that you can do that. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not allowed to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">CLIENT: Absolutely, yeah. Well, there\u2019s something like 30 thousand life coaches right now, I think, in the U.S. it said. Three percent of them are certified. So, (laughter) I mean, you know. Most of those people probably aren\u2019t making that much money or whatever, but they\u2019re obviously spinning it. They\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C91\">working at it in a way that they\u2019re able to do something, you know. But yeah, I mean, it\u2019s not going to be easy. That\u2019s part of the reason I think it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no question. I mean, you know. I think especially in, you know, people don\u2019t want to part with their money easily. They want to see what <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C92\">your credentials are. What you\u2019re, you know. So it\u2019s understandable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">So I think I have to do, you know, the blog. I basically have to build a brand. I have to brand myself, basically, as someone that, you know what, I\u2019m just a like, I\u2019ve just gone through enough things and I\u2019ve come out the other side that I have wisdom to impart. Not that I\u2019m up here just that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">you know, I\u2019ve got something to offer, you know what I mean? And that will, hopefully, be enough of an engine to get me through to actual, you know, certification. And who the fuck I mean, I was even thinking maybe once I\u2019m reenergized, maybe once I\u2019m making money a little bit, and just feel like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB2\">who\u2019s to say that I wouldn\u2019t actually become a psychologist or something? I mean, I am pretty wacky that way. I\u2019ll just fucking do it, you know. I mean, you know, who\u2019s to say? Or a master\u2019s in, you know, therapy or whatever, you know. I\u2019m not against any of that I just don\u2019t have the money and time <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB3\">right now to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">Because, I mean, that\u2019s an amazing combo. I mean, the more I think about it, like, you know, literature and psychology is like, are you kidding? One is an artistic expression of the (laughter) other. It\u2019s like it\u2019s a perfect, you know, an artistic expression that\u2019s often more real than the real. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">that\u2019s why art is literature is so amazing. It makes people feel things in a realer way that they didn\u2019t know they were really feeling or whatever, you know. So [I don\u2019t know] (ph). (Pause) I mean, you know, a lot of it\u2019s willpower. I\u2019m absolutely determined to just make this work, you know. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD2\">like it\u2019s the first thing that excites me as a job, you know what I mean? I\u2019ve never felt this (ph), not even teaching. That was just like, \u201cOh, wow. Look at me. I\u2019m actually -\u201d like, that\u2019s more like a big boy thing. Like, \u201cWow, look at me. I went to grad school, and now I\u2019m actually a teacher in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD3\">course.\u201d But I never felt really excited about any of that, you know. It just a lot of paperwork and a lot of people you\u2019re not getting through to. They just want to get through the fucking course. They don\u2019t care.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">So this is the first time I feel like, wow, all these skills I have, it\u2019s perfect. You know, it\u2019s absolutely perfect, you know. So now it\u2019s just about it\u2019s just willpower. It\u2019s sheer confidence and, you know, strategizing and, you know. (Pause) I mean, it\u2019s like consulting in a way. What the fuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF1\">is a I don\u2019t know. I still don\u2019t know what consultants do exactly. Some of them really do things. I think a lot of them don\u2019t. I think a lot of them find fancy ways to tell businesses what the businesses need or some shit like that. But it\u2019s a business. I mean, they\u2019ve (laughter) turned it into a <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF2\">business. And I think this is similar. I think some of these people are probably not shysters, but they\u2019re not telling you anything you don\u2019t know or whatever. And then, I think some of them can be pretty (pause), you know. Like, pretty potent effectors of change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">That\u2019s how I feel about it. We\u2019ll see. But (pause), I mean, it\u2019s like coaching yourself. I\u2019m not living to my potential. I\u2019m not. Right. Whatever job I\u2019ve had, it\u2019s not tapping into my real, like, core talents and personality, you know what I mean? This is, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Even more so than being a writer or a professor, you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: Professor, definitely. I mean, I\u2019m a good professor, but the thing about that, again, is that there\u2019s only a few students who give a shit in the class. I mean, that\u2019s just a standard average, right. Every course you teach, there\u2019s just a few that they\u2019re going to be like, \u201cWow, that guy was <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D51\">-\u201d they\u2019re going to remember you, you know. If you\u2019re a good teacher, you know. And I\u2019m lucky that that\u2019s happened. But you\u2019re not getting paid enough, again, unless you\u2019re the very tiny percentage now that gets a nice ten-year track and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean. I\u2019m not talking about (inaudible 32:15). If you were to get a ten-year track position as a faculty member.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">CLIENT: I like this better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">THERAPIST: You like this better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">CLIENT: I\u2019m in control. I\u2019m in control, you know what I mean? You know, it\u2019s my business. I\u2019m not sitting through stupid faculty meetings. I\u2019m not, you know. I don\u2019t have to teach courses I don\u2019t want to teach, you know. Deal with other stoody (ph) professors in the department. Fuck that. Not to mention, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD1\">it\u2019s a drain, you know. Yeah, that is a cushy job but, you know, it doesn\u2019t help you as an artist at least to me it didn\u2019t. And it wasn\u2019t because of the money it just was that it didn\u2019t help me creatively, you know what I mean? You can almost feel, like, the bitter. You know what I mean? Your colleagues <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD2\">are all kind of some of them have been there forever. Even the ten-year. They don\u2019t give a fuck anymore, you know. A lot of that\u2019s true, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">So that\u2019s why I\u2019ve said before, right, my ideal is to just keep publishing more. And then they invite me here or there to teach courses, just because I\u2019m a writer with a PhD. Nothing matters, just because this guy\u2019s a well-known poet or whatever. I end up publishing. That\u2019s different. Then I love that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">shit, you know. But this whole just actual professorship (ph) thing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really important.

I want my freedom. I\u2019m done. Like, I feel like it\u2019s about knowing yourself, you know. I just don\u2019t it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t do well I do well enough working for others. But it\u2019s not again, it\u2019s always suppressing. I end up working for managers that are shitty. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E71\">Like, I end up working for people that I could do their job better. And not just me I\u2019m sure a lot of people are like that, right. They work for shitty managers (laughter), where if they were given the chance, they\u2019d completely do things differently and make, you know. The money\u2019s never good enough, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E72\">and you\u2019re at the whim of other people, you know. I\u2019m done with that. I\u2019m just done, you know. But that\u2019s not a way to live. You know, two weeks\u2019 vacation, if you\u2019re lucky or whatever. What the fuck that\u2019s not life, you know. I don\u2019t want that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">And also, that\u2019s the other extreme. That doesn\u2019t help with creativity either. The two extremes don\u2019t help. I need something that\u2019s mine, that I schedule my clients. Even if I\u2019m only making, you know. I don\u2019t need to make a shit load of money, but if I just knew that, wow, I created something that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E91\">sustaining myself. Are you kidding? Like, you know, setting my own schedule. Engaged with people where I\u2019m learning as well. Like, my brain is you know what I mean? Like this, right? That\u2019s part of the reason why I love coming here. It\u2019s like, you know. It\u2019s helping me, but it\u2019s also I mean, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200E92\">just my personality. I like to be reflective and be a critical thinker and think about bigger questions. Why do people feel these things? You know. That shit\u2019s fascinating, you know. So, you know, I just, yeah, I just feel like it really fits, you know, my personality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 35:55) if it\u2019s crossed your mind that have you wished you\u2019d found psychology earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">CLIENT: I thought about it. I don\u2019t know. You know, my problem, the one thing about psychology is you guys have to (pause) I don\u2019t know what I am, like, as an average patient, but you have to deal with a lot of difficult stuff, you know what I mean? And I don\u2019t know if I you know what I mean? You <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED1\">got people come in here and they cry and they (pause) I mean, you know, it\u2019s some heavy, dark stuff that psychologists have to deal with. So I don\u2019t know if I could -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">THERAPIST: That feels [less of a fit] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s intense. Yeah, that\u2019s intense, you know. That\u2019s very intense. Also, you have the combination of people who are going through, you know, crying or psychologically fucked up. You may also not even really like let\u2019s face it, you know what I mean. So I feel like, Jesus, that\u2019s so I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F11\">to help this person who\u2019s sobbing in front of me, who I also kind of, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s an interesting thing that comes to mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">CLIENT: I mean, you have to, right? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be coming here if I feel like, you know, I don\u2019t think Claire really likes me. You know what I mean? I think there has to be there is a very intimate connection with people. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re just mending a broken bone. You have <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F51\">to talk. It\u2019s very intimate, you know. So I don\u2019t know if I could handle you know what I mean? Whereas with coaching (clears throat), even if I didn\u2019t totally like this person, at least it\u2019s a little more of a pleasant you know, it\u2019s about their future. It\u2019s about positivity (laughter) more. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F52\">if you know what I mean?

I mean, I don\u2019t see how psychologists can that has to be, you know. Or you have to be like my aunt just cold. I don\u2019t think she gives a shit either way whether she connects to people or not, you know. Matter of fact, she doesn\u2019t connect at all. (inaudible 38:11) They\u2019re just sad, eating <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200F91\">disorder people. I mean, there\u2019s no connection whatsoever. She\u2019s just found a niche and, you know, and that\u2019s not me either. I can\u2019t be like that. So, you know, I\u2019d have to be like you or someone like you, you know. You have to be tough. That\u2019s a, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FB\">I mean, that\u2019s at least what my social worker friends [told me] (ph), the therapists, you know. They\u2019re like, when we talked, they were like, \u201cYeah, you know, some days, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s very, very draining because of what you have to help people with, especially when you know some of those people <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200FB1\">aren\u2019t going to change.\u201d You know what I mean. Some of those people are going to be damaged for a long, long, long, long time. That\u2019s heavy, you know. I don\u2019t know if I could. Maybe down the road, I don\u2019t know. But I just feel like that\u2019s a very intense thing, day in and day out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200FD\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 39:21) draining with (ph) being, like, the emotional investment at work is different than liking or not liking someone you work with.

I mean, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m totally I don\u2019t know. I just see how could that not be a thing. I mean, I feel like two people are interacting (laughter) on a very intimate level. We\u2019re human beings. I mean, how could you not? You know what I mean? Like, we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201031\">people. We pass judgment. People have little ticks that might annoy the shit out of us or whatever. And I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I fucking hate this person,\u201d but, you know, when you have to see them three times a week, four times a week or whatever it is, (pause) on top of very serious <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201032\">issues that they have.

That would be maybe a little different in a more pleasant -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20109\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 40:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Or a lighter level, you\u2019re saying. Maybe, you know, focus on the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F\">CLIENT: Exactly. There\u2019s no way in hell if I came in here three days, Wednesday, Thursday, and if I came in here and I was sobbing and kind of volatile, there\u2019s no way your takeaway would be the same. Unless you\u2019re a robot. Do you know what I mean? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2010E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20111\">THERAPIST: You know what, it\u2019s interesting that you imagine that would be somehow worse for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20113\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not necessarily worse. I\u2019m just saying as a job, right. I\u2019m going to leave here, and then you\u2019re going to do whatever you do. There\u2019s always a residue of your work life, right? So if three days out of the week, plus all your other patients, if I was in here, you know, just fucking volatile <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201131\">and just manic or sobbing all the time, I\u2019m just saying that of course you\u2019re helping me, and it\u2019s probably very fulfilling and whatever, all that stuff. But then, at the end of that week, you know, it\u2019s probably also tiring in a that would be tiring in a different way. I\u2019m sure this is tiring too, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201132\">when you\u2019re working. But, you know what I\u2019m saying? That\u2019s tiring in a different way, because then every time you think of me, you\u2019re going to think of someone kind of falling apart. Not in a bad way, but just a, you know, \u201cMan, that\u2019s what my patient\u2019s going through.\u201d [I don\u2019t know] (ph).

When I had students that were constantly a problem, to me, it exhausted me, you know what I mean? That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Lovely people. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re, you know. And I wanted to help them, and I really tried to help them. I\u2019m just saying that tired me way more than <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201171\">a more standard kind of just students that, you know. They might have little things, but they\u2019re, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20119\">THERAPIST: I totally hear you at the practical level. And it\u2019s interesting to me that still there\u2019s some assumptions I hear you making about, like, someone about sobbing would be more tiring or problematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2011B\">CLIENT: Not problematic, but yeah no, maybe it\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Having problems. I mean, it\u2019s just I\u2019m just thinking about you never crying, really, in here. Hardly ever. Like, if that\u2019s the way that carries it, that would somehow be burdensome. Like, it\u2019s hard for you to imagine that could be less burdensome, like, freeing. Opening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2011F\">CLIENT: Oh, I see what you\u2019re saying. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20121\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t have to mean the person\u2019s crazy if they\u2019re sobbing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20123\">CLIENT: No, no, no.

Or, like, who is that person? <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201311\">Even to me. Who is that person inside your own head?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20130-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20130-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561722\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20133\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m just so sensitive. Even though that\u2019s your job, you\u2019re trained to do these things, and you care about these things. (Laughter) I guess for me, I have that its\u2019 almost like a bizarre politeness or something. Like, I feel like, God, why am I like I\u2019d be ruining your day. Not ruining <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201331\">your day but, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20135\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m very, very cognizant of how I interact with people. I\u2019m like, \u201cAh, fuck. No,\u201d you know. If we\u2019re having a perfectly interesting helpful conversation, then I busted out crying, and now, you know, Claire\u2019s going to be like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s sad.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20139\">THERAPIST: But that would be draining [or something] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2013B\">CLIENT: Or just, yeah. That it would just put a pall (ph) over the proceedings. (Laughter) Yeah, no, I\u2019m yeah, I don\u2019t do and I know that now about myself. I\u2019m overly conscious about how I\u2019m interacting with people and polite to the point of, like, maybe unhealthy, I guess, kind of, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Why would I (ph) put a pall over the proceedings?

Not like in a fun enjoyable, but just it\u2019s so I really enjoy coming here, that I\u2019d feel like I kind of (pause) not ruined it, but that it\u2019s a bummer. Or it\u2019s so out of the norm, because that doesn\u2019t happen, that it would be like this jarring, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2013F1\">like, just doesn\u2019t fit with what we do. Do you know what I mean? We have this, like, pattern of how we are, you know. Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20141\">I mean, it\u2019s almost like, you know, like when I see my I have a certain way that I deal with certain you know what I mean? When I\u2019m with my uncle or whatever, I get it, how it works now, you know what I mean. I just ask him how he\u2019s doing, let him talk. Just whatever. I would never just I\u2019ll be <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201411\">honest and be like, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m really stressed about money.\u201d Or even if I did, it\u2019d be just very quick. Like, \u201cYeah, well, you know, it\u2019s not easy being unemployed, but it\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s okay.\u201d You know, like just because I don\u2019t want to deal with him not getting what I\u2019m saying or, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201412\">you know. It\u2019s not exactly the same here, but that same (pause) just (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20143\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s some of the same, you\u2019re saying. Even here, I can feel sometimes, like, kind of how you get into here is social banter would be so much it\u2019s like a safer place to kind of have, you know, give and take intellectual, lighter conversation. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20145\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. But also, I think everyone\u2019s different, you know.

I mean, you know, I\u2019m well aware that when I\u2019m here, it\u2019s very (pause) it\u2019s like we\u2019re just hanging out, you know what I mean? Yeah, I don\u2019t get I\u2019ve wandered about that too. It\u2019s like, ah, man. I mean, I do feel very deep <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201491\">(laughter) things, but I\u2019m just not moved to, you know. And those times that I was, it just kind of happened. I couldn\u2019t control it, you know what I mean? But there haven\u2019t been other times when there was one time, a few weeks ago, when I bought up my grandmother? I did feel like I could have cried, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201492\">maybe, you know. But even then, it didn\u2019t, like I would have been okay to shed a few tears.
