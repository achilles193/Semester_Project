I lived in New Mexico for two months when I was kid. I was like, \"This is amazing.\" I was like, you know, (crosstalk 00:53) body fat until after college too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah (crosstalk 00:57).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I was accustomed to the cold.

Yeah. Probably if I stand up straight, you know, get a good pelvic tilt. Don't slump my shoulders. Yeah, and (ph) I went in for my back because I was so tight and fucked up. I (inaudible 01:34) bad anterior pelvic tilt, which really brings your height down. The nurse is like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">\"How tall are you?\" (inaudible 01:40) I'm five-nine.\" And she's like, \"No, you're five-eight.\" I'm like, \"What?\" She's like, \"Yeah, you're five-eight.\" And I'm like, that's how bad my posture's been, why (ph) my back is so fucked up. I'm like, that's sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Took an inch off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I lost an inch [from that] (ph). Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So five-nine, 160. Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I'm well within my BMI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I feel fat. So I had this girlfriend in high school, Keisha Donaldson (sp?), who was anorexic. She didn't really lose much weight because of it, which is interesting, you know. (inaudible 02:29), like, the reason she had become anorexic was for attention, you know. And she would commit suicide <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">for attention, all the time, you know. Not all the time, but frequently. Frequently enough that, like, it was just a thing (inaudible 02:48). It was like, \"Keisha tried to kill herself again.\" And as her boyfriend, this was really upsetting, you know. (inaudible 02:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. She did it while you two were together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, a couple times. A couple times. One time, after I kissed and felt up on another girl over the summer, and another time after I broke up with her. (Sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: They were both in response to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Both in response. Well, also, those weren't the only times (inaudible 03:22). She did it in response to things. People would do things and she'd try to kill herself. She'd end up in the hospital and, like, you know. And (pause) I just remember because I broke up with her. I think I may have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">told you, like, when I was 17 or so, I was staying with my uncle. And she came over to visit. My uncle was going to be gone all day. And so we were going to, like, just take off our clothes and be teenagers together. (inaudible 04:02) and it was great. [And I was great] (ph). And I remember, very clearly, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F2\">she was lying on her back and I was lying just above her, you know, positioned above her. Both naked. A (ph) raging hard-on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">And I'm just like, \"I think I want to have sex with you,\" because we hadn't done that yet, you know. And she looked in my eyes with such intensity, and she's like, \"Make love to me,\" in this very serious voice. And the look in her eyes was so intense that I immediately said no. Like, \"We're not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">to do this.\" Incredibly strange, I think, for a 17-year-old boy not to have sex when he's seconds away from having sex. But it was the responsibility, I felt, come (ph) from that. I knew. I was like, \"I'm not ready for this responsibility. Like, this is forever,\" you know. Like, this intensity I cannot <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">reciprocate. And I knew that. So I did not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: It felt like it was forever. She was saying (inaudible 05:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Well, there was this real intensity, yeah. She was serious. She was into this. There was a level of commitment I hadn't realized was possible, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: It's like that horrible moment you (inaudible 05:19) and you realize the girl you're dating is way more into you than you are into her, you know. No pun intended. But, yeah. And yeah, so shortly after that, I broke up with her. I was like, \"This is not good,\" you know. \"I shouldn't be in this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">situation,\" you know. And she keeps trying to kill herself. And she's (inaudible 05:50) in this other guy, Harry, and she's going to move into his house, you know, because her parents are whacky, you know. And so, she does, about right around the time she tries to kill herself, you know. And I'm devastated, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">again (ph), you know. And so I'm calling her in the hospital to see if she's okay. I'm on the verge of tears, just not crying. [I'm just] (ph) asking her [so I'm like] (ph), \"Is this my fault?\" And with such a vindictive tone, she's like, \"Yes.\" And I immediately absolved myself of all guilt. The tone <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200593\">was so obviously attempting to hurt me, but I was like, \"Oh, wait. No, this is not my fault. She did this in response to something. She did this intentionally to create a response.\" And so, once I understood that's what was happening, I was like, \"Oh, then it's not my fault. She did this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: So (inaudible 06:56) on my 18th birthday to tell me she was having sex with Harry (inaudible 07:02) she moved into the house with. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Happy birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. I remember just being like, \"Good for you. I mean, great. Good.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: To her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm like, you know, whatever. I mean, you're good. I'm glad that you're having sex with Harry, if that's what you want to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: But what, it wasn't it didn't affect you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: It didn't. I wasn't like, \"Oh, man. Oh, no,\" you know. It (ph) wasn't a big deal. But she called me to hurt me with that, I mean, clearly. And obviously, called me on my birthday for a reason, you know. And I'm like, whatever, you know. Kids today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Hurting you like, she felt like she had [been hurt] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right, you know. And she was friends with my sister for a little while. My sister was there one of the times that I broke up with Keisha, you know. I think the last time. No (ph). I did it over the phone because that's, you know, what people did in those days, you know. Oh, I was 17. What do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">you want, you know? And it wasn't easy to go see her. It's two hours. It's two hours' drive. So [when I was going to go to] (ph) her house for two hours, you know, I'd be like, \"Blah blah blah, I'm breaking up with you,\" trek (ph) two hours back, you know. It wasn't going to happen. Didn't have my driver's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D2\">license then anyway. Didn't get that till I was 18, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 08:34)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: No, that's all right. But I do have to turn on the airport (ph) (inaudible 08:45) airplane on. There we go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Cool. (inaudible 08:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. If I get, like, a text message or a phone call, it will (inaudible 08:58).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible 09:00) very useful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so (pause). Yeah, so there I was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: So you do it over the phone, and your sister is there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible 09:17) she's hanging out with my sister. My sister's (inaudible 09:20) (yawns) or Middletown. One of those places. I don't fucking know. I don't even care, you know. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Did your sister have anything to say about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I don't know.

What was the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: I just didn't have like, she was just this extension of my mother, you know. And so I just lumped her in, you know. And there were moments where I was, like, the protective older brother, but also (ph) because I knew that's what I was supposed to do. You know, that was the role I was intended <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">to play by television. And so, television had been raising me for a good portion of my life. That's where I took the cue from, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">It wasn't till years later, it wasn't till after her wedding and after her children were born that I actually it's when Eva (sp?) was two, is when I actually wanted to have a relationship with her. And I was like, \"Oh, I'm going to go see my niece,\" you know. Uncle Tim was (inaudible 10:28) went over <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">there to see Eva (sp?).

She was like (inaudible 11:43). She was like, \"Oh, I need some toilet paper from downstairs.\" (inaudible 11:48) And I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" And I come upstairs and open the door, she's naked on the bed, and he's naked on the bed with her sheet up to his chin. And, you know, and she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">like, \"Oh, you weren't supposed to come in.\" I'm like, \"Well, (pause) why wouldn't I come in?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: To your bedroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Right. Of course you would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: She just called you up there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible 12:12) very weird. And (inaudible 12:17) she took me in the shower with her when I was eight or nine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: She did -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, at the temple. Because we were going to the temple. And she was like, \"I have to take a shower.\" And I was like eight or nine. I was like, \"Nah, I don't want to.\" (inaudible 12:31) So she was wearing her temple garment (inaudible 12:34) thin mesh, you know, t-shirt and, you know, boxer <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">shorts essentially. And sort of picks me up and she's me in the shower and she's, like, holding me under the water and everything and singing something, I think, or laughing. Chanting. I remember just being like, \"I hate this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: You hated [it too] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: I hate this. So, yeah. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: She was very intimate with she shared a lot of intimate details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, certainly. Certainly. I was like, \"This is not good.\" Because she got things wrong all the time. I remember when I was five, my sister was three, and she was putting us in the bath together. I look at my sister. I'm like, \"She doesn't have a penis.\" I'm like, \"What's that?\" And she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">like, \"Oh, that's a clitoris.\" Now, for years, I'm like, \"Oh, a vagina is a clitoris. That's what that is,\" which I spelled in my head. As a five-year-old boy, I spelled in my head q-u-a-t-o-r-i-s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, quatoris.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know. And it struck me, I was spelling things in my head when I was five. I didn't realize I could read, but I could spell things in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 13:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible 14:01), you know. And it took me years to realize she said, you know, clitoris. But she was referring to the entire business as clitoris. And she told me that when I was older and I was having sex with a woman, and she, like, asked me, \"Honey, did you gum yet? Did you gum?\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C71\">And I'm like, first off, no woman asks you that question. That's not a thing you have to be like, \"Oh, did that happen?\" No, no. Clearly, clearly, that happened, you know. It's quite detectable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Gum (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So [it was very strange] (ph). And when I was four I started masturbating when I was four. Just, like, (inaudible 14:56) against the ground, you know. And I was like, \"Oh, this is cool.\" Like, you know, one day my mom catches me doing it. She's like, \"What are you doing?\" I'm like, \"Oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">I'm doing my penis exercises.\" You know, I was like, \"Oh, this is an exercise I'm doing.\" And she's like, \"Well, you shouldn't do that because someday you'll do your penis exercises with your wife.\" And I had this image of my wife and I, of me and a naked woman, lying side-by-side on the ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Rubbing on the ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, facedown. I'm like, why would we do that? I'm like, that doesn't make any sense, you know. But so, for years, that's how I did it.

It's like, \"Oh (inaudible 15:45) do anything,\" you know. You know, and (laughter) I remember when I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">12, and I'm like, \"Oh, that's how that's supposed to go.

This is Mormon town. Second only to murder. There's almost nothing worse. It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">better that you rape someone than touch yourself. It's less evil.

That was so serious. Yeah (inaudible 17:23) be like, \"Oh, wait. No. That's far too serious.\" (inaudible 17:31) period of time when I still thought that I should wait to have sex when I got married. That didn't last past my first semester in college. It didn't last <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">past my first opportunity outside of high school to have sex, you know. [I remember] (ph) dating Sandra Wells. That's back when I was the only freshman (inaudible 17:50). I was getting passed already by the older women. And it was great. It was fantastic. I'm like, \"This is amazing. Like, I'm hooking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF2\">up with all these girls and, like, doing stuff and straight fun.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">And then one of the few times in my life, at that point, I realized Sandra was flirting with me. We were in [Roger Fulton]' (sp?) room, and Star Trek was on TV, and she's like, \"Oh, I like Star Trek. Star Trek's pretty good.\" She's like, \"But, you know -\" she's like, \"Whatever, I'm just going to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">hang out in my room right now. You know, just me. It's (ph) kind of lonely.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay. Great, see you later.\" And she's like, \"Okay,\" as she goes. And, like, five minutes later, I'm like, \"Oh. Oh, okay.\" (inaudible 18:30) Knock, knock, knock. And she's like, \"Hey.\" She's like, \"I didn't know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F12\">if you were going to come down here.\" I was like, \"Yeah, no. It took me a bit, but I figured it out.\" And so we started hooking up and that (ph) was great. And it was after a couple days of that that Betty Hummels (sp?) came by, knocking on our door. She's like, \"Oh, hey. I see (inaudible 18:46). How's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F13\">it going?\" I was like, \"Oh, I'm sticking around here (inaudible 18:49). Okay, I'll see you later.\" And Sandra's like, \"Oh, god. Like, was it her turn with you?\" you know. And I'm like, you know, I mean, \"I'm here with you. That's what's important right now.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">And she found out I was a virgin, like, day one.

That's fine.\" And, you know, we hook up a couple more times. I'm like, \"You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">what, I (ph) changed my mind.

And, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F32\">know, I was like, \"So that's what's actually important.\" And she's like, \"Oh, wow.\" (inaudible 19:41) I remember being, like, right before we actually decided to do it, she looks me deep in the eyes and she's like, \"Listen.\" She's like, \"You will always remember me.\" [She said] (ph), \"This is significant,\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F33\">you know. She said, \"This is the first person you're having sex with.\" She's like, \"This is a significant event.\" And she's like, \"Before you do this, you have to consider, you're always going to remember me and you will never be able to forget me.\" [I remember looking in her eyes] (ph) so super smooth, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F34\">like, \"I never want to forget you,\" you know. Boom (ph). Done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">But, yeah, and then we had sex. And it was great. And I was like, \"This is amazing.

I'm like, \"That's a man looking back at me.\" (Laughter) And she's laughing and laughing. I'm like, \"I'm so fucking hungry right now.\" And she made this, like, tray of muffins or cupcakes. She made a tray of cupcakes in her toaster oven. I just ate them. I ate six cupcakes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F52\">Like, ah, yeah. I just chowed them down. I was so hungry. And yeah (inaudible 20:54) like, \"That was great,\" you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: It was like your body came alive [or something] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was like, \"This is amazing.\" It changed my world. It changed my entire world. And I was like, \"I just want to do this all the time. Like, this is what we should be doing.\" And so we had a lot of sex. [I wouldn't leave] (ph). Then I was with her all the time. You know, I was, like, really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F91\">clingy and really needy. The virgin fling, you know, is what the phenomenon you may have heard of, you know. So, like, someone has sex with someone for the first time, it's like, \"Oh, now you're the most important person in my world,\" you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">And eventually, she was like, \"I need you to leave.\" She was like, \"I need you to go home,\" you know. It was after a couple months. And I was heartbroken. She broke up with me, and I was heartbroken. And it destroyed me. Absolutely destroyed me. Didn't know what to do, you know. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Broke your heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. She totally did.

You know, someone has to be your first eventually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and something about you and sort of seeing it as [you did] (ph) with Keisha, and then you feeling it in your own way, a kind of real attachment or really deep, deep attachment to that person that Keisha was going to have to you for the rest of her life. I mean, (laughter) possibly -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Like you said, forever. It was going to be forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: So later that year, I hooked up with Felicity Belton. Felicity Belton was notorious for liking to have sex with people and for having sex with lots of people. And (inaudible 23:05) we were flirting. She'd been in college five years at that point, so she was 22. So we were all, like, \"Oh, we're <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">18 and 19, and she was 22,\" you know. It's an older woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 23:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: (inaudible 23:19) she had a lot of sex, and she was very open about how much sex she had. And I remember (pause) yeah, I remember the cast party, because cast parties were amazing, you know. Let's all get drunk and high and fuck each other, you know. Or, like, just, you know, group makeout <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">sessions or whatever. We'd all pile into one bed and just, like you'd fall onto the bed, and you'd kind of get passed around the bed. You'd come off the bed at the other end. That was great, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: This passed around thing (inaudible 23:52)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sex was a very, you know, open thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Casual and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah, very casual. And we connected. We were theater majors, so we could do passion in seconds, you know. It was what we trained to do, was form immediate connections, you know. And so, you know but I remember being extremely drunk, drinking, like, half a bottle of Southern Comfort, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">with a buddy of mine and taking shots of [Gold Slider] (ph). You know, just being fucking ridiculously drunk. For a 115-pound boy, you know, drinking half a bottle of Southern Comfort and a bunch of shots of [Gold Slider] (ph)was trash. It was absolutely trash. And I remember going up to her, being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F2\">like, \"Hey, you know, we should have sex. And (inaudible 24:40) I'm not very good yet, but, like, you're really experienced. You could, like, tell me what I'm doing wrong,\" you know. And she laughed, and she left. She's like, \"Come back, talk to me again when you're sober.\" I'm like, \"Okay, okay.\" So <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F3\">I stumble away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">Like, half an hour later, I walk up. I'm like, \"Felicity, I'm sober now. You know, we should talk about this.\" She's like, \"You're not sober.\" I started just laughing because I'm still totally trashed. I'm like, \"You're right.\" Anyways, not till later in the spring, after I broke up with Sandra. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">I had this conversation with her, I think, possibly before Sandra even. No, that wasn't before Sandra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: The night you were drinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so then after Sandra, we had the Vax (ph), which was a virtual memory system. It was before IM. (inaudible 25:28) Vax terminals in every room you could do word processing on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20124-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20124-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: And you could also chat with other users. And so, you know, late at night, you find yourself either surfing the net with a text browser, you know, text-only browser. Because Netscape was amazing, and it was only in the computer science lab on the Macs. And they had pictures on there. It took, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201291\">like, ten minutes to load a picture but, like, it was there. You could see it, a picture over the interweb. (inaudible 26:00) But, you know, and then you'd see which of your friends were on because you pull up the user list and you scan through everyone who was online till you saw, \"Ah, Belton,\" you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">And so, I'm like, \"Hey, what's up?\" She's like, \"Oh, you know. Not much. Blah blah blah.\" I'm like, \"Look, it's, like, 2:00 am.\" She's like, \"Yeah, I know.\" I'm like, \"We should totally hook up.\" She's like, \"Really?\" I'm like, \"Yeah. We should do this,\" you know. It's like, \"I'm single. You're single. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">We should do this.\" She's like, \"I'm walking to (inaudible 26:35) to get a can of beef stew.\" She's like, \"If you meet me on the way, you can come home with me.\" I'm like, \"Great.\" So I go on down (inaudible 26:48) back to her room. But we actually didn't have sex at all. She was like, \"No, we're going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B2\">to fool around and stuff.\" And she's like, \"You don't want to have sex with me (ph).\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: What was the \"ah\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: Herpes, apparently. Herpes. So she wasn't, you know, going to be like, \"Let's have sex. I'm having a herpes outbreak,\" you know. No, it was later the same year, I got a call from Orlando (inaudible 27:17), which is a few dorms away for upperclassmen. And he called my phone. He's like, \"(inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">27:22) really need to talk to you right now. It's really important.\" I'm like, \"Oh, shit.\" I'm like, \"Betty, sorry. Like, you're going to have to go home. Orlando needs me.\" So she's like, \"Oh, okay. No problem.\" Because we had [just been fooling around] (ph). (inaudible 27:30) Walked down to the (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F2\">27:34) and he's waiting to let me in. I'm like, \"Orlando, what's wrong?\" He's like, \"There's nothing wrong. It was important.\" I'm like, \"Well, what's so important?\" He's like, \"Well, one, we're waiting for pizza.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" He's like, \"And two, Felicity Belton is upstairs naked in my room and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F3\">she wants to have a three-way.\" I'm like, \"Oh, sweet. Yeah, no problem.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">So I was kind of making out with her. And I actually went down on her. And I was thinking the fact that she had herpes, you know. But, you know, she wasn't having an outbreak and I didn't get it, you know. So lucky me. Rolling dice. But she was, like, really impressed that, like, I actually gave her <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">an orgasm. She's like, \"Really?\" She's like, \"I don't get that very often.\" She's like, \"So that was nice.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, cool.\" And at one point, she's like (inaudible 28:23) she's like, \"Man, maybe you guys should touch each other.\" And we kind of look at each other with horror. And she's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201312\">\"Wow. Both your dicks got soft at the same exact time.\" (Laughter) Yeah, sorry. That's nothing something either of us are really into.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">And I remember her being, like she's like, \"Well, we have to go to bed soon,\" and Orlando being like, \"Oh, come on.\" We were like, \"Ah, come on.\" And she's like, \"Okay.\" She's like, \"Put on the Rusted Roots Could,\" roughly (ph) 45 minutes long. She's like, \"When that ends, we have to go bed.\" So I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">get up to put on the CD and Orlando's like so I put it on repeat. And it's somewhere in the middle of the, you know, maybe third play through. She's like, \"Wait a minute.\" She's like, \"Did you guys fucking put this on repeat?\" We're like, \"Yeah.\" We were just messing around because we were kids and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201332\">we could mess around for a long time, you know. (inaudible 29:15) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the way you describe her.

Like, they're kind of almost like they were mentors (inaudible 29:33).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: I was looking for mentors. I always look for mentors, you know. I'm getting [old now] (ph), to the point where it's harder to find mentors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: But they were willing to have kind of a very open attitude about sex, and that it was a good thing but, you know, nonetheless (ph) it's something to be taken serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: It was often (ph) serious, yeah. Yeah, exactly. You know, which is kind of how I treat it. I've never actually had sex sex, vaginal intercourse, with a woman I didn't care deeply about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: You know. Except, technically once. And we never did it again. We did a lot of other stuff after that, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: Just once, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. Didn't even finish. Started to cry. It was shortly after I broke up with Patrice. And (inaudible 30:23) was, like, crying (ph) pretty hard. So we're actually having sex and I was just like I was like, \"I can't do this,\" you know. And it was because I did not reciprocate. Like, I knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201471\">that. I knew I didn't feel the same way, you know. So I do all sorts of stuff with women, but not if I didn't if I wasn't deeply invested. Come to think of it, I lied to myself one time too with Laney, when I was a senior and she was a freshman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: You lied to yourself. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I told myself that I loved her enough to have sex with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Oh, oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: I didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: That, [in that way] (ph), makes it feel like you want to or you can (ph) or you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: [I was like] (ph), \"I shouldn't have done that. I don't love her the way she loves me.\" And so I broke up with her a couple times. Then finally, the last time for real, I saw her [to her room] (ph), and she's crying. (inaudible 31:25) she's just like, \"I love you.\" And I'm like, \"I know.\" I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201531\">was like I said, \"But that's going to pass,\" right. You know, \"You won't always love me. You'll get over me, and you'll love somebody else,\" you know. And that was true. She did get over me. She did love other people. And later that year, we hooked up hardcore. It was amazing. Just fucking I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201532\">just directed my first show (inaudible 31:55) about a young boy who's mother kills herself when he's five-years-old. And then his attempts to relate to women throughout his 18 years, you know. Deeply personal story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: [Seems personal] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And it's just, you know, it's a series of it's a scene monologue. Scene monologue. And all the monologues are as (ph) journal entries, you know. And then the scenes are different women, his relationships with them, and, like, stuff like that. And (pause) I just directed it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201571\">and I was feeling like a God, you know, because I was a senior and all these freshmen women are like, \"Ah, you're amazing.\" Because I was amazing, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20156-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20156-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">So we're at the part where we're getting trashed. [You might get] (ph) drunk and high and, like, I'm drunker than I've ever been in my life. And people are like, \"How many beers have you had?\" I'm like, \"This is, like, number five.\" And Ginny (inaudible 32:56) is like, \"He said it was number five, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201591\">two hours ago.\" I'm like, \"Ah, shit.\" (Laughter) \"I had (ph) no idea. I have no idea how many beers I've had.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">And so we start playing Spin the Bottle, which was so common. Spin the Bottle escalated quickly. We're a theater group, you know. Women feeling up other women, you know. There was lots of dudes kissing dudes. Like, I kissed this gay guy for a while. He was a really good kisser. We all agreed he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B1\">the best kisser amongst all of us. You know, again, their (ph) sexuality is fluid. [I was never] (ph) concerned about those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: It was kind of an experimental -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Anything above the waist with a dude was fine, you know. Like, that was fine. (inaudible 33:48) seven minutes in [heaven time] (ph). And I was like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">THERAPIST: So where you go in the closet -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible 33:52) two people off to the bathroom and make out for, like, seven minutes or whatever. And the rest would play, like, a tamer round while they were gone. So that was fun. So first, I rolled Miranda (sp?). Miranda (sp?) was a friend of mine. I go to her, I'm like, \"Hey. So what <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201631\">do you think?\" She's like, \"No, no no.\" I'm like, \"Really, come on. You and me. You and me.\" And she's like, \"No. (inaudible 34:17). No, no.\" I'm like, \"Ah.\" She's like, \"You're really drunk.\" I'm like, \"You're (ph) not really drunk.\" She's like, \"I'm not.\" (Laughter) I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" So we stop <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201632\">for, like, seven minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">THERAPIST: [All of the] (ph) seven minutes in heaven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah. Then we go back out there and (inaudible 34:31) Laney. I'm like, \"Oh, man. I don't know.\" When we get in there, I'm like, as we're making out, I'm like, \"This is amazing. This is really good.\" I'm like, \"We should go back to my place.\" She was like, \"Yes.\" So we went to my place, and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201671\">was amazing, you know. Just really, really good. And that was the last time we broke up, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: What about it was good? What was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: I don't know. She was finally her own person, you know. She didn't need me like she did in (inaudible 35:06) relationship. Turns out, I was her first. She didn't tell me this. She lied to me. She told me she'd had sex, like, with her boyfriend in high school. But she hadn't. She was a virgin, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">which explained why the time we had sex was so weird. I was like, \"She's not really into this or moving.\" She was in pain, you know. She had never had sex before. This was brand new. And I didn't know she was a virgin, you know. I'm like, I would have treated things very differently. One, I probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B2\">wouldn't have had sex with her. Two, if I had, I would have approached things very differently. I would have really taken a lot more time to ease into the entire process, you know. Really kind of walked her through the experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">The way I did with Ginny, you know. I started dating Ginny, Ginny was like she's like, \"This is going to be weird for us.\" She's like, \"I'm not a very sexual person yet. I know that you are.\" And I was like, \"Okay. Well, yeah.\" I was like, \"But we're going to take it slow,\" right. And so we did. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D1\">took it very slow. I kind of walked her through all the various stages, you know. One night, we were just kissing for a long time. (inaudible 36:25) I just (ph) kind of, like, had her shirt off. I'm exploring, you know, her breasts and, like, what that was like for her and that (ph) whole experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D2\">and everything. Then just kind of kept moving through the stages, you know. And I was like, \"We're not going to have sex until you're absolutely positive that's what you want to do.\" And it was the summer after her freshman year, after my first senior year. And she's like, \"Yep. Ready now. We're going <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D3\">to do that.\" And so we did. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2016C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559997\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Well (inaudible 37:00)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20171\">CLIENT: You know, it was awkward for her the first time too, you know.

What was it like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20175\">CLIENT: It was, like, okay, be as gentle as possible, but also make this finish relatively quickly, you know.

And if not, then it's the lack of connection, you know. It's the dehumanization, you know.

How do I care about someone I'm never going to meet, who exists in, like, fucking Brazil, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201A11\">you know? And who wears what is obviously a wig and contact lenses, you know. Which I cannot fault her. I mean, she wants to have a professional career as, like, a rehab counselor, so (ph) she's getting her master's [in it] (ph), you know. And this will pay for college, you know.

It reminds me of this graphic novel this guy wrote, where prostitution is semi-legal. Like, if they come to your house, it's fine. If you go to their place, it's not. So outcall receiving call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Outcall is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201AD\">CLIENT: Is when they come to your house.

I do want to have sex.\" He's like, \"So, what do I do?\" So he starts having sex with prostitutes, and it's about the entire journey, the experiences. And I found he had very similar experiences, you know. It was like, \"Oh, okay, here's this new thing we can do. Okay, this is interesting.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201B12\">And then after a while, he's like, \"Oh, these are the people [who are on selection] (ph). I don't want any of those people. I'm looking for a specific person.\" And then (inaudible 44:31) specific person, you know, is faking a connection with me. Like, physically, she's my favorite. And then he finds <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201B13\">this one prostitute actually that he just sees exclusively, you know. And pretty rarely (ph). A couple times a month, you know. And he's like, \"The moral of the story,\" he says, \"As far as I'm concerned, is that it's perfectly fine to pay money for sex, as long as you're having sex with the right person,\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201B14\">you know.
