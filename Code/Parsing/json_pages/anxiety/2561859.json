I had a strange experience when I walked into the pizza restaurant. I wanted to get a coffee drink and I ended up buying these gift cards because you can use them like cash, so I was buying these gift cards, and for twenty-five dollars, I can get a free medium coffee. Okay. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">I looked at him, \u201cOh well, I know you. You\u2019re from, you lived across the hall from me for two years the last time I was living here.\u201d Kind of bizarre because it\u2019s kind of like, cool, I don\u2019t know that many people here. I know like five, that are still here, so for that to happen was very jarring. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Anyway, I\u2019m all right. I\u2019m just it seems that (pause) I don\u2019t know. (pause) It just seems that I\u2019ve been so busy that even my structured stuff has got to fall by the wayside. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Are you happy with what you\u2019ve been busy with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, this, I\u2019m happy to get this stuff done. Again, it\u2019s this website thing, but it just seems to me to be snowballing, just (inaudible at 00:02:22). I\u2019m not really sure everything I\u2019m putting up is accurate, but (inaudible at 00:02:29) is nowhere on it, so I mean\u2014but I got a nice plug <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">from the independent group in Europe plugged my site and (inaudible at 00:02:47), so you know, it\u2019s getting some recognition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: High praise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. So but I\u2019m also trying to figure out what, going from hardly ever working on it to working on it quite a bit, I\u2019m trying to figure out what is the threshold for feeling like I\u2019ve done enough each day? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">But yeah. Aside from that, I\u2019m quite attuned to just how the docket balance, I should say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Feeling good about myself and falling into despair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Those are pretty wide gaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Maybe I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. And well I don\u2019t know. It just seems like it\u2019s\u2014I have to remember just how easy it is for the structure to fall apart without deliberate maintenance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Then does no structure equal despair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: It can, often does. And like if I, I went to Vermont this past week and that was fun, and didn\u2019t get to go to the gym, and then on, Tuesday, let\u2019s see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t get to the gym at all this week, and that is something that I can\u2019t help wonder, is this, am I putting so much on that if I don\u2019t go, it\u2019s so damaging to have it (inaudible at 00:05:39). So (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">But I mean, sort of\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I was just going to ask where you were, and where do you want to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know (inaudible at 00:06:39) despair, but (inaudible at 00:06:43). I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">But I just am, it\u2019s all this terminal (inaudible at 00:07:17). I just don\u2019t like feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: What were you feeling? When you say despair about your marriage, what does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, like I\u2019m lengthening something that\u2019s stretched beyond its nature. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">I mean, I firmly believe that divorce is often a result of relationship failure, but the person\u2019s relationship with themselves reflected or exacerbated through the marriage, but I see this is as my own issues with myself, but it just seems like I have a\u2014really die hard and so despair is about whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">or not I can either choose to be true to myself which is following those old habits that aren\u2019t help, but aren\u2019t healthy. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561859\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Or choose who I actually want to be, choose the, choose to steer the course, not let my fears, anxieties and insecurities overtake how I\u2019m going to live or how I\u2019m going to feel about myself. But again, it just seems like such a slippery tightrope that\u2019s about right, my insight I can just fall off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: So what happened to the steered course this week? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Well, on Tuesday, I told my wife I was going to the gym, then to the grocery store, and I went to a different massage spa to get a massage, then I went to the grocery store. And that kind of stuff really bothers me because part of it is if I\u2019m willing to allow myself the first incident and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">catastrophize it, was that just a little bit too easy that I was able to say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to try a different one and see what happens there?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">Nothing really happened there at this point, but I could tell, it was the same kind of feel, that they were just waiting for me to say, \u201cWell why don\u2019t we do this?\u201d It was that kind of bizarre. But nonetheless, I didn\u2019t tell my wife that I was going to do that, even though I had intentions of doing that, and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: What stopped you from telling her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s the fact that I don\u2019t feel like my intentions are pure going to those places. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">That I am seeking something out that just might put me in a position where I might be compromised. And that really bothers me because on the one hand, I (inaudible at 00:12:17), and think about it and wonder you know, what would happen if I went back there? And I knew that I was doing the same thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">after the first one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I wonder what it was that you were seeking in going to this new one? So you didn\u2019t go back to the same place where you knew what might happen. You also didn\u2019t go back to the place that\u2019s tried and true and you knew what wouldn\u2019t happen, so I wonder what it was? What were you really doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well, I think I was trying to play the innocent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">\u201cOh I didn\u2019t know that was going to happen, oh, I was in the moment.\u201d Because I think that\u2019s what used to happen when I drank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: To yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: You were saying that to yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: It was something that I would say. That was my justification. But, you know, I mean, I don\u2019t even feel comfortable telling you about this, honestly. It\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: What are you afraid of in telling me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: That I, that I seem to have this problem. Twice makes it a problem. And I, you know, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m afraid to tell you about a problem, but I don\u2019t know if I really want to admit that this is a problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">I can tell, and I guess I was thinking a couple days about this, you know, when I get hooked on something, I look forward to it. And the idea that, I don\u2019t think I was ever on (inaudible at 00:14:20), but I think I was excited about the next time I was going to drink because I was in a state where things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">might happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And the flirtation with that was exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. And you know, I just, I\u2019m putting myself in these places that apparently I want to be in, because I think about them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">And dwell on them and yet, I know it\u2019s not helpful ultimately, in the short term. So to say I\u2019ve got an addictive personality, I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s just too easy, but it seems like, and I\u2019m also, I heed what you\u2019re saying about what is it that is fulfilling, what is satisfying about this, and I try <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">to think about, you know, what would happen if my wife were to (inaudible at 00:15:59) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561859\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">That just doesn\u2019t excite me. I don\u2019t know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t have that sort of illicit thrill in the same way that a fantasy about me does, or one of these massage places. You know, I think part of what feels exciting about it is that it\u2019s somewhat illicit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Drinking may have felt the same way, or what could happen when you were drinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s the same excitement I get before I come to see you as I go. (inaudible at 00:17:05) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">And steal glances at her, things like that, and get my body worked over, you know, in so many ways. I get to go drinking and I get to let loose and not have to be responsible for my actions, not to be responsible for ogling you because it\u2019s natural. It\u2019s what\u2019s to be expected. And yet, I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">if the solution is to just say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to deny alcohol and not touch it.\u201d That seems to have taken care of that outlet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: But the rush that you seek or the freedom from responsibility that you seek or, you know, the excitement that you\u2019re seeking, that doesn\u2019t go away, the need for those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Just got placed onto something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that\u2019s what I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: So the need for something exciting and thrilling, that\u2019s totally normal and not harmful in any way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">But seeking it through things that make you feel guilty later or ashamed, that, and that\u2019s the harmful piece is the fact that the momentary satisfaction is met with a much longer lingering feeling of guilt and shame.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. It seems like those desires of illicit (inaudible at 00:19:59) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">Seem to be amplified when my idea of what it means to take care of myself is not happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a different way of taking care of yourself, I guess, so you have lots of different needs for self-care. When you let the other ones go unfulfilled, that one kind of gets bigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. And self-legitimates and kind of blocks out the idea of the other ones that aren\u2019t being met. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Is there anything that feels thrilling or good in the same way that\u2019s not illicit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t walk into the gym like I walk into the massage places. I mean, it\u2019s like, this is going to suck, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">I mean, I think that\u2019s the same for everybody. Well, maybe not, but so\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You walk into the gym thinking it\u2019s going to suck?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. You don\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: No. I think maybe we should find a form of exercise that you enjoy more. It\u2019s hard, and you know, I say that honestly because the exercise is obviously good for you, right? We know that it\u2019s good for anxiety, we know that it\u2019s good for fighting depression, it\u2019s like good cardiovascular, even <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">though it has a lot of good things. But if you honestly go in there thinking it\u2019s going to suck and you hate it, it\u2019s really hard to keep that up. And so, not that you should never, ever go to the gym again, sometimes it might be the only way, but if there\u2019s other ways, and the thing that works about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F2\">exercise is not that it happens in a gym. The things that works about exercise in all those ways is that you get an elevated heart rate for twenty minutes or more and like all those good things happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561859\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">So maybe you\u2019ll define avenues that are easier to sustain that give you some of the same benefit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: You think so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: I hope so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Well this is the way it\u2019s always been for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Like snowshoeing, bike riding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, sure.

I mean\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Ice skating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll have to think about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">But to answer your question, the illicit tools are hard to match as far as I can tell, as far as I can (inaudible at 00:24:20).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your earliest memory of enjoying something that felt illicit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: It was, I have a lot of early memories, but it was when I was with my sister and I was like twelve, eleven or twelve years old. That was a thrill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: When did it feel bad? When did the thrill of what happened with your sister turn negative? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Probably when my dad, when she ran away accused my dad of sexual abuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: What was that time like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Maybe months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: It feels like a really long time in the life of a twelve-year-old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, you know, (inaudible at 00:25:40), but I guess I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re asking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Well I think those first connections of strong feeling are pretty ingrained. I mean, our emotional responses, that thrill is an instinctual response. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">It\u2019s a pretty deep-seated response, and so the first times of having those kinds of responses to a situation become pretty ingrained, so you know, what you\u2019re going to have your strongest responses to are going to be things that mimic that in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Not immutable, but it does form a basis, for, you know, what you\u2019re going to respond to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, so someone else might be like a first reaction is playing with fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and that was a really thrilling, watching fire come to life and having a really kind of thrilling moment with that could be, yeah, it could be. And then you have your choice between becoming a pyromaniac or to become a firefighter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">Or, you know, some sort of chemist that makes fabulous things using heat and flame, who knows. So you know, it\u2019s not that having had that experience and a strong physical response to it does not set you on one path and you have no choice about it, but I think it is important to be aware of what informs <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">your reactions to things and then like you said, then you steer the ship. But if you\u2019re trying to steer the ship in a way that has absolutely nothing to do with what you naturally respond to, it\u2019s going to be a lot harder to continually follow a course that feels kind of meaningless to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">Now can you force yourself to go to the gym and work out? Yes, if it feels like drudgery every single time, how many times are you really going to do that? How long are you going to sustain that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been two months almost, now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: But imagine if you found something that actually corresponded better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: That I can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Like becoming a race car driver. You might get a thrill from that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561859\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Oh my God.

Perhaps, so what you\u2019re saying is that the need for the thrill likely won\u2019t go away, but the thrill, how it\u2019s met, can be, you know, modified. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that yes, we can find, I would like to think that we could find a way to feel that thrill in a way that is more adaptive for you. So I guess, yeah. I\u2019m not going to say modify what gets you that response, but find the thing that feels acceptable to you that gets that response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Okay. Is that, I have nowhere to start. I don\u2019t even know where to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Well what else, what else has bordered on feeling good like that, that didn\u2019t also feel shaming at the same time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a tough one. It is hard for me to think of one where I was not also very scared. Sailing, for example. Thrilling, but also some anxiety that I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Anxiety, but was there shame?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Or guilt? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So anxiety\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s not saying this is going to suck, but it is, \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m going to fall off the boat.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Right, yes. Well that\u2019s part of what the thrill is, right? That there\u2019s some danger there that, and there\u2019s a different finding the boundary of what level of danger is acceptable, right? You know, that differs for people, you know? Some people free climb, other people would never do that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">The different level of accepting, you know, how much risk are you willing to accept here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">But there\u2019s a difference between, I think, the kind of straightforward risk and then that sort of tantalizing sexual risk where the risk is, \u201cI hope I don\u2019t get found out.\u201d That\u2019s different than \u201cI hope I don\u2019t fall off the boat,\u201d because there\u2019s not the shame. Falling off the boat, and, you know, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">drowning, there\u2019s no shame in that. There\u2019s a lot of fear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: You can\u2019t be shameful when you\u2019re dead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: But there\u2019s not that fear of what will people think, people will think I\u2019m a horrible person. That\u2019s shaming, and I think carrying around shame is damaging to you. You know, fear for your physical safety, it\u2019s actually that\u2019s a survival instinct. That\u2019s not bad for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. So is a common narrative, for lack of a better word, among people who do not look for those sorts of things to resort to affairs and whatever? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know, to be honest. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a sort of gathered research on who does what why. You know, I think there\u2019s lots of reasons that people end up having affairs, you know, thinking about what your narrative is and what would make sense in your story, you know, it seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F31\">like that\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of, that you know, if you didn\u2019t curtail this somehow, is that where it would go? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">You know, if you look at it in a broader sense, that\u2019s probably true. You know, people who are dissatisfied in some way seek satisfaction in lots of ways and one of them might be an affair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: I was tired when I came in.

Not raining, draining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Draining.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561859\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: What is it that, what do you think feels so draining about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Processing it, or considering the different alternatives, fighting the urges or the tendencies to resort to what I think is just me. It\u2019s hard to resist those thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: What if you thought of yourself as a thrill-seeker instead of as someone who, I don\u2019t know how you think of yourself, actually. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">Whether, what is the label that you\u2019re using?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Creep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Ah, so thrill-seeker seems better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is an interpretation. I\u2019ve just never thought of myself as the type to skydive or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Have you tried it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: No. I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Not that particular one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Skydiving? (inaudible at 00:36:49).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m going to not say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: Really? Bungee jumping? For the record, it is bungee jumping. Are you crazy? Wow. Where?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t even answer the question, Bryce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">CLIENT: That\u2019s all right. Where was it? I mean, was it like over a river?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Amazing the fantasies that you\u2019re actually fulfilling right now, without me giving any information. I\u2019m not going to answer your questions, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Because if I were to give you a list of things I\u2019ve done or not done, then it gives value to some things versus other things or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">it gives you comparisons to make, and I don\u2019t want you to do that. I want you to find your path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: Sure. No, understood. I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily honor bungee jumping or dishonor it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: But I don\u2019t want to give you the impression that I\u2019m voting for you to do certain things or not other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s got to be something that I feel comfortable doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: And as much as I like you, I don\u2019t run out and say, \u201cThis is what Dr. Keller (inaudible at 00:38:10). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: And what might get, I guess what I really want you to do is sort of find, is there something that would feel good to you after that might also give you that same sense? And it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be something that\u2019s physically dangerous. You know, some people get a thrill from learning <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201291\">how to cook something new, and we need to figure out what feels good for you both in the moment and after, what\u2019s going to satisfy that need to have that feeling of like, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">Without, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just did that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah. So if I felt as though my inability, I know it\u2019s an inability because I\u2019ve demonstrated it for years, decades. If my inability to adhere to structure, to alerts that are from all those things actually denies me the satisfaction that those things normally hold <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">What would you recommend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Motivation. We only really do things when we are sufficiently motivated to do them, and we are much better motivated by some sort of positive reinforcement, getting something good, because we\u2019ve done something, than anything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">And for whatever reason, even though we have tons of research to show that people do things, other beings do things because they get something good they want from it, so somehow we continually try to motivate ourselves to do things by chastising ourselves, which is negative reinforcement, taking away <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201331\">something good, right? I\u2019m going to deny myself this thing because I didn\u2019t do whatever I was supposed to do. It doesn\u2019t work as well. If you really want yourself to do something, you give yourself a nice reward when you\u2019re done. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20132-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20132-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561859\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">And not yelling at yourself when you do something that you don\u2019t like or fail to do something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve done lots of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t work. Prison time. It doesn\u2019t work, right? This is what we do. We do something we don\u2019t like, we put you in prison. How often do those people end up back there? It doesn\u2019t teach. It doesn\u2019t motivate positive behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like feeling guilty after doesn\u2019t stop you from doing something you didn\u2019t want to do, because that sort of punishment, or negative reinforcement in its truest sense, doesn\u2019t work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I see that clearly after this. I know we have to end soon, but I\u2019m just feeling like the idea that I can go through my day, any day, without seeking the approval, the validation, of someone who\u2019s approval or validation really doesn\u2019t matter to me <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">It\u2019s like on the train yesterday, I saw this beautiful woman, and it was, I was determined to have her notice me. I kept looking. I kept looking, but you know, and throughout, I thought to myself, \u201cWhy is this person me? Does it mean something if somebody who I think is attractive thinks I\u2019m attractive? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201411\">Does it mean something to me? Why does it mean something to me? Is it really going to, you know, sustain me until the next beautiful woman I see? Is Dr. Lowry\u2019s approval of me going to help me become a better patient, a better human being, whatever?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">A different human being, healthier human being? I mean, it\u2019s really hard for me to believe that is it going to be the story of my life? That is frustrating. I mean, as much as I enjoy those thrills, it\u2019s also frustrating that I seem to be addicted to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">THERAPIST: You feel a lot more self-sufficient if your own sense of self meant so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. If my own achievements, my own whatever have the weight that those of the glances to, should those glances even happen? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">You know, that\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: And when they don\u2019t, that leaves you right now feeling very lacking, because your own sense of \u201cI\u2019m good just as I am,\u201d just isn\u2019t there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: No, and what I\u2019m not entirely sure about is what do I need to have in my life in order to say, is it the job? Is it going to do physical activity three or four times a week? Is it losing weight? Is it finishing a song, is it doing this stupid website? It\u2019s not stupid, it\u2019s really important, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D1\">but it\u2019s going into retirement, but so what is it that I need in my life for me to say yes, and tomorrow I\u2019m going to measure my achievements by the achievements I made yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">Not against somebody else or tomorrow I\u2019m going to focus on what\u2019s going on inside of me and not what\u2019s going on inside of this office or train or whatever. No, I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">THERAPIST: Just as something to think about, the difference between the external stuff, job, website, how often you work out, weight, job title, whatever, and your value as a human being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">CLIENT: Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m sorry, I should actually clarify that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">What do I need in my life as a means of sustaining positive attitudes, not so much I\u2019ve got a job, but what the job gives me, in terms of you know, production or whatever. Does that?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20154-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20154-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561859\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: It does, except I still feel that the positive self-regard is more stable when it comes from what you are, you know, the phrase human being versus human doing, so the human being is like that\u2019s your value as a human, as a human, I don\u2019t want to say being again, but I guess human person versus <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201571\">all the things that a human being does in getting their worth based on what you do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">You want your internal sense of confidence to be mostly, you know, I think it\u2019s hard to say totally based, but mostly based on just who you are as a person, not what, not all those things that your person can do. You\u2019re trying to build confidence from the outside in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">CLIENT: No, I guess what I mean is, like the job, for example, does it give me the structure I need to be the person that I am as opposed to absence of which allows me large amounts of free time in which I\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: You have to make a whole lot more choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, so those things that are, what do I need in my life to basically distract me, for lack of a better word? But I know what you\u2019re saying, and I struggle with being as I am. What is, you know, not those things that make me something, but the person that I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but when you think of yourself as a creep, it\u2019s hard to feel good about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:49:29)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: We want to start to change that, change the way you think of yourself so you can feel differently so you can go do different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s just hard when someone thinks getting up on the same time and not feeling like I\u2019m being a very good husband, not feeling like I\u2019m being a very good this, or friend, or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">So what, then, is the person that I am being, what is that? Is it something to not really feel good about, you know? I know we\u2019ve got to stop, but do you have a pen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re welcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
