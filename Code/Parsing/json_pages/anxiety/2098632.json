Yeah, keep me posted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: You never know. Mom and grandma.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh, I didn't realize your mom was going to be out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. Whew, I'm exhausted. My closing got cancelled yesterday but I decided I didn't know if you had to reschedule something in there or not but and my hearing was cancelled. The closing was cancelled because the lender at the last moment killed the deal, based on too many foreclosures in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">the area. Yeah, so they consider it insufficient collateral. The value's fine but the collaterals I've never heard of it before. It's the most bizarre thing ever. And the mortgage contingency date was the 18th. And I talked to the loan officer and he's like, \"Yeah, everything's good,\" you know, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">they couldn't submit the appraisal until the 18th and I never asked for an extension. I didn't think we needed one. So it expired on the 18th. So if she doesn't close she's going to lose her deposit. And no matter how many times it old her this, she's got a commercial estate friend who called me, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">put it in multiple e-mails. She doesn't understand why she can't get her deposit back. And everything she does, she's worried about it affecting getting her deposit back. So, the listing agent has referred her to a bank that hopefully can get it done so I don't get sued. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: All right, two things. Backing up. So you didn't want to see me yesterday, you didn't want to check...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: How come you didn't when did you find out the closing was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Friday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, I had a reason why. I'm having trouble. I mean, I just had I have a closing today. When I get back I have a closing on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Cameron, it's OK. Like, I'm not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I just can't remember why. There was a reason. Oh, I know why because I needed to do laundry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: (laughter) [The ideal if it's] (ph) dirty laundry, one way or another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I was supposed to do some emergency title, just get some deeds and stuff and I ended up getting it online Monday. So at that point I just figured it was better. And I felt coming in Wednesday would be better because it's closer to next Friday. And of course, yesterday I found I was closing today. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">[It's been] (ph) crazy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">When I woke up yesterday I was a little stressed out because I got all these e-mails about these closings but then I kind of calmed down and I was fine. The same thing happened this morning. I was a little stressed out then I calmed down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You felt like I was calling you on something (inaudible at 03:40) you seemed kind of a bit shaken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Shaken?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Stirred?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: It's hot out. (inaudible at 03:55). I shouldn't have worn this suit. It's too thick. You asked me a question. I felt like I didn't know the answer. I knew there was a reason but I can't pinpoint it. (inaudible at 04:17) the chance to sleep in a little bit, which I haven't been able to do in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">a long time. It's because of, you know, all weekend with skating and snowboarding. But, yeah, sorry if I was shaken.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: (laughter) Nicely done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098632\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, whatever. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: In this situation with the woman who lost her deposit, so the lender so she couldn't get her deposit back after the 18th of January?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Mmhmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And the lender...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: For failure to get financing. I mean, there could be other reasons she could get her deposit back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right, right, right. Like, a tree falls on the house. And it looked like she was going to get financing. She was going to be fine but then the bank pulled some crazy shit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, late Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: And said, \"Eh, there were a lot of foreclosures in the area. We're not going to do this (ph).\" And so at that point she was up a creek. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yup, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: So you referred her to another bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: The listing agent did, who can do it in three weeks. I think she's nervous because she thinks she's going to be stuck in this problem but it's like, the foreclosures are going down and it's ... And, you know, this bank is willing to do it. They saw the appraisal. They I know the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: There's no incentive for them to get into it unless they think they're going to do it and they don't just waste their time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Right. So, you know, that's been kind of stressful dealing with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: And the seller doesn't want to walk away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: It's a short sale so they want to sell it. But they also want to keep the deposit. They don't and 6000 bucks is not, like, a huge deposit. (pause) But, you know, I sent her an e-mail (inaudible at 06:37) she has her friend, this commercial real estate guy, call me. And he wasn't, like, yelling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">at me or blaming anybody. There was an undercurrent of blame, you know. As many times as he said he's not trying to blame anyone. He's like, \"Well, you know, I don't understand why if there were many conditions you didn't get an extension.\" I said, \"This is different than commercial real estate where <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">you get a clean, you know, written commitment from the bank to lend you money.\" I said, \"Most wholesale lenders don't issue a commitment they issue an approval and there are always conditions.\" And, you know, none of them raised any red flags. You know, we had the appraisal, the value was there, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200533\">know. And I said, \"You know, if we went by how you think we should do this we would be extending the commitment to closing on every deal, you know, because there are always conditions.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">So, you know, should I have extended? Should I not extended? I'm torn, you know. There's part of me that feels like, well, she's losing her deposit so I've done something wrong, you know. But there's a part of me that says, you know, this is really kind of one-off out of the blue, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">So, you know. I haven't been killing myself over it or worrying excessively. So I dealt with that all day Monday and I did all my laundry yesterday. Like, three times my normal amount of laundry. And no good-looking women at the Laundromat. But my hearing to set a trial date, we're going to settle. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">We're just going to drop the case outright. Both parties are...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Oh, this is the big contesting (ph)? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that suck, all the work I put into it and then (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Oh, does that mean you don't get...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I'm going to get paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh OK, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: And, you know, the...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098632\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 08:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I wanted a trail. I wanted to win, you know. And the disenfranchised trustee, you know, she keeps e-mailing me. She's e-mailing me about stuff that's among the three trustees. Like, \"The defenPhilt does not want to pay my fees.\" That is between her and the guy who flipped. And I said, \"I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">nothing to do with that. That's between the three of you.\" You're going to get my bill. If you don't pay it, we'll go to small claims and talk about it, you know. I mean, they only owe me, like, I believe it's, like, three grand or so. So I'll set up a payment plan with them if they want or you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">just disappointed. You know, just very bizarre to me, once again, you know, why did this guy flip? What changed his mind, knowing how far along we've come? And the disenfranchised trustee thinks that the defenPhilt paid him off. It may have happened. Never know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">So, you know, that kind of sucks but I don't have to worry about doing the trial. Yeah, I've just been running around, just doing a bunch of stuff, you know. Still being productive and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: (sighs) Drank a little bit last night. Didn't puke or anything like that. So, I had a couple of drinks. Buddy from college was in town. I feel myself having a cold though. I really didn't even want to go but I'm like, I really should see him. I don't know. I think I'm kind of, you know, I always <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">get a little stressed out leaving town, you know. And I've got to deal with this closing while I'm out of town. I've got three closings, you know, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. I get back Tuesday night. You know, if there's any delay in my flight or anything, you know, I could be screwed. So I don't know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That's great you got three closings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It makes up for closing yesterday. The thing is, is this kind of my pipeline so it's, like, I only have one closing left at the end of February. The money's already spent as usual. Summer camp, rent. I don't have enough money to pay my rent or my malpractice for (ph) the first of the month. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">So I'm just not sure where the money goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">But I'm seeing the kids a lot. That's part of the why I'm so busy, as I've been making an effort to spend time with the kids. I work on Ian's (sp?) pinewood derby car with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: How's it coming?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: And Lucille's already...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: How's it coming?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Oh, pretty good. You know, we've got a couple of coats of the paint on there. You have to wait 48 hours for it to cure so we'll put some more coats on tomorrow. And we're making a bumper car, so I've got to put black in the seat and black around it. And I'm thinking we may not have enough time <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">to put enough coats on with black paint, that we might just take, like, a sharpie. I don't know how that would look. If it looks like crap we can always paint over it. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">But Lucille's apparently always asking to see me. She's still a little shy when I get there and always tells me what to do, where to sit, what room to stay in. Ian (sp?) totally antagonizes her with everything, you know, just takes her food and takes the toys she's playing with, you know. And I'm, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">reprimanding him and he's just laughing, you know. He thinks it's funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">I know Jess's really stressed out because she really hasn't a chance to work. The kids have been sick and she's been missing work a lot. You know, I texted her the day I was getting my parking permit. It expires at the end of the month and the long line. And so I texted her. I just said, you know, I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">going to miss Lucille. You know, it'll be nice one day when, you know, she can actually come on me with a trip, you know, she's comfortable enough. And then Jess sent a text about, you know, it may help to have a more regular schedule with her, which, you know, is very difficult for me, which she understands. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F2\">And I didn't respond to it because I'm just, like, you know, tired of this regular schedule, so I didn't... So then she's like, \"Are you OK?\" Yeah, I'm fine. She thought I I mean, I'm sad but not, like, super sad or anything like that, you know. Just... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098632\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right, nothing unusual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Because I know she's going to be upset probably not seeing Ian (sp?) but not seeing me too. Because I've been seeing her, you know, almost every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Wow. [That's great] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: A day here and there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: But even if it's only for, like, a little bit. But this is kind of her personality. She stayed home sick. You know, her separation anxiety. She stayed home sick. The next day she didn't want to go to daycare. And Jess always says, \"Oh, go see Lilly (sp?), your friend.\" And she goes, \"No see <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">Lilly (sp?) anymore.\" (chuckles) Of course when she got to daycare I'm sure she was fine. Lilly (sp?) wasn't there she was sick. But she definitely has Jess's stubbornness. Yeah, this separation anxiety thing is just really bizarre. I mean, you know, just (pause) it's like [if I get there] (ph) and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200892\">I just, like, touch her, you know, she runs over to mom, \"Up, up, up.\" You know, I mean, eventually she steps down and settles down and we can play. I can chase her and she chases me. But like, if I first get there and try to interact with her it's upsetting. Or she comes home and I'm there with Ian (sp?). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">(sighs) But it's kind of taking up a lot of my time. You know, like, tomorrow is the day before I leave town and it's like, I've got E&amp;G, I have to get my B12 shot and then Ian (sp?) wants to work on the car. So it's like, I really don't have time tomorrow to do anything so it's like, I have to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">it done. My closing at 5:00, I have to go and start making copies and get it out for the lender tonight because I'm not going to have time to do it tomorrow. And (pause) sometimes I almost wish she wouldn't let me see the kids. I'd have more time by myself. I just feel like I'm running around a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It seems like you're kind of running around a little (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: You're pretty observant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: And, I don't know. I have to run to the office. I have to cash some checks and print out he closing package and close. You know, plus (ph) I have to deal (ph) these checks. I was there the other day and I'm like, \"Oh, I'll deposit them later\" and I should have deposited them. And hopefully there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">more checks waiting for me and maybe I can pay my rent. I don't know. My buddy Phil said he's sending me two checks today. So hopefully it'll get there tomorrow. He said he was sending them Friday but they actually go out in the mail today, you know. Under other circumstances I would go to the northern <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200932\">office and pick them you but I just don't have time.

I mean, if you did it differently in this deal it would mean you're handling almost every deal differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, if I looked at it and saw I mean, maybe I might in the future think twice about leaving an appraisal hanging out there that hasn't been approved by the lender but I've had deals w\/t he appraisal has been approved and then when it goes into approval review the day before closing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">it gets killed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Right.

I think when something like this happens, I think you generally feel like you fucked up, I mean, in respective of whether you have or not or if there was anything you could have done. I think you basically feel like you must have done something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">wrong and that what you're saying is sort of defensive or involves making excuses in a way, even if you actually know it's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: What's true? That I fucked up or that I didn't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: You didn't. I mean, I think when you're explaining it there's an extent to which you feel like you're making an excuse because at bottom you feel like you did it wrong. Even if as you say the thing that feels like an excuse you know it's actually true. You know, as though your hand is kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">of always in the cookie jar, even when it isn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I always have doubts in my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

And he's probably familiar with that area but I sent an e-mail to Claire <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">anyway since I hadn't done anything with her in a long time. And I wanted to put in there, \"Are you cheating on me with another attorney?\" Because I ran into her, maybe last fall or whatever, you know, and she kind of hinted that she doesn't have anything going on. I'm like, it's been a long time since <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D92\">she's taken a deal, you know. Two years maybe? I don't know. I mean, we've done deals but they're all deals I've sent to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">So I think I did it more just to feel her out, you know, trying to make her feel guilty.

Just, you know, the fact I was able to go do laundry and....<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: Has it affected your appetite?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: Definitely.

So I ate half of that. And then we went to a restaurant and I ordered some chicken wings and I maybe ate half of them. And our waitress didn't put it on the table, put it on the railing, and I said, \"I'm going to forget it there\" and sure enough, I left them.

I guess that's what it reminds me off. The day before a closing you just kind of be anxious because something could go wrong, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">something could get fucked up, it could not work out, you would feel responsible, it could make stress and hassle. It seems like that, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Well, and, you know, I've got this closing that I'm going to have to deal with while I'm in the city, if something goes wrong. I've got three closings when I get back, you know. I mean, that's kind of part of it too, is it's like, you know, it's the work I have to do around traveling sometimes. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">It's like I never maybe I've mentioned this before that, you know, if I ever need work I just need to schedule a trip because then all of a sudden I'll have a closing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it is uncanny how often that's happened.

I didn't go to bed till after 2:00. I got home at 12:30, 1:00 but I don't know what I was doing. Just wasn't tired. (inaudible at 39:44). I was worried about, you know, what effects the Adderall has, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201371\">you know. I'm sure most of it has been worn off by that time [of the day] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098632\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: So I had some beers on Saturday but I didn't take the Adderall on Saturday. I did take it Sunday because we were working on the car, you know, just to get me motivated and (inaudible at 40:17). I don't know. Not (ph) my brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Because my brother's been dating this woman. The family's been kind of just blown away by how sappy he's being on Facebook about this woman, how she's special and blah blah blah and none of us has even met her. And she posted something yesterday about you know how you ask to change your password <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">and, you know, you need an alphanumeric of so many characters. Well, she had it in all this other stuff that was really witty and funny. I can't even remember what it was but it was funny. So I (inaudible at 41:07), you know, I said, \"You're way too witty for Jeff and he's clearly over kicked his coverage.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F2\">And he texted me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">(silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: OK, so he goes, \"Why do you have to be an ass?\" I said, \"I was born that way.\" Then he said, \"I meant why do you have to be an ass,\" which he probably sent while I was, you know I don't know why he did that. And then he goes, \"Yeah, I know.\" And then I said, \"I was complimenting your woman.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201431\">And he goes, \"Thank you very much... yeah, OK, whatever. By trying to make me look bad? Great... I really appreciate it.\" And I said, \"See? You have no sense of humor. I bet she thinks it's funny.\" And then he goes, \"You missed the point. Obviously I have a sense of humor. You know, just forget it.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201432\">And then I said, \"She's pretty witty.\" And he goes, \"Yes she is.\" And I noticed that she liked Phish on her \"likes,\" you know. So I said, \"Does she like Phish?\" And he goes, \"Why do you ask?\" I go, \"If she does, she's cooler than you too.\" (laughter) And I put a little winky emoticon thing there. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201433\">then he goes, \"It's nice to know you've got my back when I need it. Makes me feel really good to know that.\" And then he goes, \"Thanks.\" And then I'm like, \"Any time bro.\" He goes, \"I guess you still don't get it or just don't care. Whatever.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">Then there was I don't know if I was drunk when I did this but there was some comment I made and a post that was I put a little bracket, you know, insert I don't know. (pause) I don't know but, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: We should stop here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: But as you can see I have a wonderful relationship with my brother, who's not going (inaudible at 43:42). I'd shake your hand but I have a cold. You might want to wash down your chair. Water might not be enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Have a good trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: Yeah.
