(Pause) I\u2019ve also been avoiding talking about work because it\u2019s just demoralizing. [0:00:59] But work is really not going well. Now, I\u2019m at the point where my mentor is checking in on me multiple times a day to make sure that I\u2019m actually on task and doing work and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">being productive. And it\u2019s really\u2026 it\u2019s humiliating, and I\u2019m still not getting anything done. And it\u2019s really\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do. The last, I don\u2019t know, month and a half really I\u2019ve been spending more time on the Internet at work and less time actually doing things that need to be done. And when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">I\u2019m not on the Internet just everything I need to do, and I\u2019ve missed a couple of deadlines. And it\u2019s just been awful, and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause) [0:02:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: The last couple of months have been really busy, and there\u2019s been a lot of stressful stuff going on in my personal life but also some really amazing stuff. I\u2019ve been happier than I ever have been before within my personal life, when I\u2019m not at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: But there\u2019s still just this constant underlying malaise, I guess, of feeling like I\u2019ll never be good enough at work and in my personal life. [0:02:58] I\u2019ll never be interesting to the people around me. I\u2019ll never produce art that people actually want to look at or to see. A constant drumbeat <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">of comparing myself to my friends and finding myself falling short. (Pause) [0:04:00] My friend Jeannette puts a thing on her website about her latest collaboration. Ellen Kushner, who is a pretty big deal in sci-fi fantasy publishing\u2026 [0:05:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. An author?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and a publisher\u2026 approached Jeannette and asked Jeannette to write a poem for an anthology Margaret was editing. And Jeannette\u2019s friend Cindy was also invited to contribute to the anthology. So Jeannette and Cindy collaborated, and so Jeannette \u2026 so Cindy was writing a story. And in her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">story the protagonist was a singer, and so Jeannette\u2019s poem was the song that Cindy\u2019s protagonist is singing. And then the song was based off of a painting that was made by another mutual friend of Jeannette and Cindy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: And then Jeannette\u2019s sister, who actually is a sister, and her husband, who is a very talented musician, wrote a setting for the poem and recorded it. And it was just this amazing multi-person collaboration. [0:05:58] And (sighing) I felt a little bit jealous that I don\u2019t have any of the skills <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">necessary to participate in something like that. [But, I mean] (ph), on one hand that was a choice that I made back in high school not to develop any of those skills. And I\u2019m trying now, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s\u2026 I feel like it might be too late for me? That\u2019s a little sad, especially because (chuckling) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">I\u2019m not actually good (ph) at my job, which would use the skills that I did invest time in to developing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559682\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I see.

One is, it sounds like you\u2019re preparing this for your family (pause) and are kind of (pause) anticipating and kind of simultaneously battening down the hatches\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [0:11:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Imagining you\u2019re going to get a pretty heavy dose of this on the trip\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yep. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: And (pause) I can imagine a few different ways it might relate to things here as well. I\u2019m not sure\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Which it is. I could imagine it as a way of preparing not to be here next week or sort of\u2026 [0:13:05] (Pause) Yeah, I\u2019m not sure. I think both of us know that in a sense your [real connection with your family who makes you feel like death] (ph)... I\u2019m not sure. (Pause) [0:14:00] [0:15:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Something that\u2019s really frustrating to me is when I tell Jack that I\u2019m feeling demoralized at work and I haven\u2019t been productive. He\u2019ll come back with, well, I have unproductive days sometimes, too. I know how you feel. And it\u2019s (sighing)\u2026 (Pause) [0:15:55] He just refuses to understand that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">there\u2019s a huge qualitative and quantitative difference between having an unproductive day every single day without a single day of doing something, anything useful for three months, versus having one unproductive day in the middle of a year where you won a fucking award for being the most valuable engineer <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">on your team. (Sighing) It\u2019s really invalidating and upsetting. And then\u2026 so I stopped talking to him about it. And then he assumes that things are going well at work because I\u2019m not talking about it, because I talk about my feelings all the time. And then I have a day like yesterday where I just came <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F3\">home in tears because everything was just so horrible. And he was like, well, why didn\u2019t you tell me? Well\u2026 (Pause) [0:17:00] And I\u2019ve tried telling him explicitly, saying that you have bad days too is not helpful for me. It actively makes me feel worse, please don\u2019t do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: And yet he\u2019ll keep doing that, I guess because he forgets or he doesn\u2019t care or I don\u2019t know and it doesn\u2019t really matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I dread going to work.

(Pause) Except this time it\u2019s my own brain that I\u2019m passive against.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yes, absolutely. (Pause) [0:22:57] Only you also seem to be recruiting your manager a bit as well. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing anything wrong\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: But part of how it\u2019s working out and I think it has worked before is, you recruit him into doing something that sort of makes you feel subject to and kind of humiliated by someone else\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

[0:25:55] But I could imagine a few different ways (inaudible at 0:25:56), that, at this moment as well as at other times, you don\u2019t have much to say. (Pause) It\u2019s hard for me to have a sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">of that, to what extent it\u2019s feeling shut down, to what extent it\u2019s feeling like, I\u2019m not playing, I want to take my stuff and go home\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) No, it\u2019s not that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019ve said everything that\u2019s on my mind right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I mean, I don\u2019t have anything new to add? The things I\u2019ve been thinking have just been kind of reiterations of the same thing, of, I feel worthless, and I hate feeling worthless, and I don\u2019t know how to stop feeling worthless, and it sucks. [0:27:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I encourage you to state them anyway. Let me explain.

But the way you talk in here is as much or really honestly quite a bit more so about process and what unfolds. It\u2019s more so about that than about content? So if you were to sit here and just say the same three sentences for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">entire hour, from a content point of view, you could have left after two minutes, and we wouldn\u2019t know anything more. [0:28:04] But from more of a process point of view it\u2019s very different to do that for forty-five minutes than to do it for five minutes, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: It has a very different feel.

I worry that I picked the wrong line of work, that this is just not an industry that I am well suited for and that I should have done something entirely different and that it\u2019s too late to change. (Pause) [0:32:00] And I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s real or if that\u2019s just a grass is greener <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">moment.

(Pause) [0:33:00] [0:34:00] [0:34:57] I wonder if that\u2019s a little bit [the part] (ph) where I\u2019m then supposed to say, well, clearly this is just about you being so fucked up. This is not at all about your kind of talents in this line of work.

They\u2019re getting scarce (ph). There\u2019s a whole set of skills I don\u2019t have yet.

I mean, I can figure it out, I\u2019m smart. But it\u2019s definitely a physical skill that requires practice. (Pause) [0:37:00] I think I\u2019d do better in a job that was less self-directed, [someone convince] (ph) me to go down rabbit holes and chase problems that aren\u2019t really problems or problems that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B72\">are far less critical and\u2026 I don\u2019t know, something where there\u2019s an expectation that the job would receive more direction, as opposed to, we\u2019re going to check in on you because you\u2019re fucking up at being self-directed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.
