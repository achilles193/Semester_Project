They signed a release for Dr. Timber to talk to me, not for me to talk to her, because they wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">to share some historical information with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What I told Dr. Timber is that I wanted to talk to you first. Did you know about that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: No. I know that my mom sees Dr. Timber, but I\u2019m fine with sharing. We\u2019re open with each other so it doesn\u2019t surprise me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re okay with my getting information?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s your decision. Do you have any concerns about it at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: No, we\u2019re quite open with each other. I\u2019m not hiding anything from them and they\u2019re not hiding anything from me, so I\u2019m comfortable with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Both parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: All right. I\u2019ll talk to Dr. Timber and hear whatever information she has to share with me. Again I want to be clear; I have no permission from you to say anything to Dr. Timber.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the news I have. Start wherever you like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I guess starting with a small bit of good news. I have a part-time job tutoring after school at the Jewish Community Center in Silver Spring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just a part-time thing, but it\u2019s something and I guess it\u2019s been the right feel for when I start the program in September. It\u2019s just more practice and experience in that field, so that\u2019s good. That\u2019s the bit of good news that I have and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with me in the last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Is the Center school an accredited school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s the Community Center up on Mill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know which one you\u2019re referring to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: It\u2019s an afterschool \u2013 it\u2019s not actually a school.  They have a preschool there, but kids up to age 13 come after school to do homework and be entertained until their parents can pick them up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: What ages are you going to be tutoring?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Whoever needs help up until age 13. I started yesterday and spent some of the time playing with shaving cream with one of the first-graders who is learning to spell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Starting young.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. But then one of the older kids was working on a project on Albert Einstein, which I was helping her with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: So you have quite a range of experiences the first day. Are you going to be working every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I think every day except when there\u2019s a Jewish holiday, which this week there is, so I\u2019m not going today or tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s one about every week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. They have today and tomorrow off. They gave me a full calendar, but like you said, it\u2019s quite generous with the holidays. It\u2019s something to do and it\u2019s a bit of money until something else comes along or something on top of it. Positive developments, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it looks like you\u2019re pleased about it. Any other feelings?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s obviously a good step in the right direction, having something and being that it\u2019s in the field with what I think I want to go into. I think it\u2019s sort of a double benefit. So, yeah, I think overall I\u2019m quite happy with it.  And like I said, it\u2019s until I find something else or if I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">choose not to find something else and just do something else on top of that, so be it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Are you still going to be looking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll still look. There\u2019s less pressure to find something because I have something already. It\u2019s something that will be beneficial, not just financially but also in terms of getting experience that will help me come next year when I start my course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Have you heard anything yet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Oh, yes. I have two bits of good news. They did get my transcripts and so everything is fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re in? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Double congratulations. It\u2019s a good week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I kind of forgot about that one because I always assumed that it would go through and everything would go swimmingly once all the paperwork came together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounded that way. Have you celebrated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve celebrated too much, no. I\u2019ve kind of sighed a bit of a sigh of relief in the fact that it\u2019s settled and squared away. I think I\u2019m just now learning what the next steps are because, as I mentioned to you, one of the major hold-ups was finding accommodation and now, of course, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">I have a year to find accommodation.  Just taking those next steps now, there is a limited amount of on-campus accommodation for students on this course and I feel that now, since I\u2019m probably about the first person accepted for next year, I\u2019ll be in a good position; especially since I\u2019m coming from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F2\">so far away to attend. Both of those factors may be in my favor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Do you know the procedure for getting housing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I did when I got in last year. I said I need help finding accommodation, either on campus or off campus and they said, \u201cWe can\u2019t help you on campus.\u201d They had one room off campus available and, by the time I visited it, it was gone.  It was just because, like I said, it was so late <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">in the process. Now, hopefully, when I send that e-mail off again the buck will stop with, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll give you a room.\u201d They have like an apartment block with apartments with suite in it. You have your own bathroom and you share a kitchen and common area with other people in your course, which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200632\">what I was hoping to find initially simply because people in your course are working similar hours to you. You\u2019re a similar age. One of the apartments I had, I could have found rooms, perhaps, with young freshmen coming in, but I didn\u2019t think me pursuing a post-graduate degree and really having to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200633\">serious would work with the typical freshman experience at college.  I think this will work out much better, being with other students on the same course, similar work ethics and hours during the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: It does sound a whole lot more encouraging this time in terms of getting a space. When do you apply for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Technically, the application cycle for next year doesn\u2019t begin until mid-October, so new applicants can\u2019t apply until the middle of October. Really they would only start normally accepting people from then until November, so I think it opens up late October\/early November.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019ll be right at the head of the line, won\u2019t you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes, I should be just about front of the line, if not very close to it which means, hopefully, I\u2019ll get into the dorm that I want to go to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: All of a sudden things are real encouraging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, things are starting to pan out a bit more. All along, me getting in was a step in the right direction. It was just a bit hectic and crammed at the time, but it was always a positive development, me being accepted at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Getting accepted was your medium-term goal and you started right off today talking about getting a part-time job, where we left off last week, if you recall, which is what are you going to do this coming year?  Have you had any other thoughts about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: My other thoughts had been that if I\u2019m not finding anything trying to find a course to take somewhere, which now is \u2013 of course I still have time to do that, but it\u2019s less of a pressing issue. Then the other thing was just look for either a full-time or additional part-time position to lie on <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">top of this current position. (pause) The whole idea just being getting experience, building towards next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Getting as much out of the teaching experience as you can.  It does sound like a reasonable plan. Did it ever or has it ever crossed your mind at all the thought of moving out of your parents\u2019 place into something of your own or sharing a space?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I think it has, but I think because I\u2019m trying to think realistically about when I will be on the course and won\u2019t be able to be making any money. I think that probably added a bit to the stress level I had, thinking I didn\u2019t think I had enough of a savings pot set aside for that year. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">that\u2019s somewhat another goal of mine to ferret away more money for that year where it won\u2019t be possible to make any money, where everything will all be outgoing expenses and nothing incoming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think we ever talked, at least I don\u2019t recall talking about how you would finance your education over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: There is government assistance for teachers with a certain level of qualifications and in the U.K. it doesn\u2019t work in the same way as it works here. You have to start paying back I think 90 days after you graduate. You start paying back I think a few months after you start earning a certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">amount of money each month.  It\u2019s not liable for interest until you start earning a certain amount of money, so I think I would certainly choose to do that, if for no other reason than to start building up a bit of credit for myself over there, since all my credit history is in the U.S.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Do you have any idea how much it\u2019s going to cost you overall to finish the degree?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: The degree is 7,500\u00a3. Their own campus housing is about 3,000\u00a3 for the duration of the course. That\u2019s just the course plus that, not accounting for food.  It\u2019s about 10,000\u00a3 total.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: 10,000\u00a3?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: 10,000\u00a3 and then food and travel or whatever as additional expense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re better with numbers than I am. What is the equivalent in dollars?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Not good right now. I think it\u2019s about $15,000 plus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: And that would be the entire amount to get the degree?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Degree and housing. It\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s cheaper than it would be to do it here still. I think certainly putting a big aside, the amount I would be able to take out in a loan would be to cover the tuition, not to cover the housing I don\u2019t think. I would just be responsible for the housing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">and living expenses up until the time I am employed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like, if I\u2019m hearing you right, you\u2019re going to contribute some towards that 10,000\u00a3.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Are you going to borrow the rest? Are your parents going to . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: They have offered some assistance. They\u2019ve said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let you starve\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let you have anything like that\u201d so they have offered their own assistance. I think that the other goal for this year was to try and obviously not establish complete financial independence <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">because I don\u2019t think that will really be possible until I have a full-time job, but to gain more financial independence so that I can fund more of it personally as opposed to feel that I\u2019m relying too much on mom and dad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: You said that the thought had crossed your mind about getting a place of your own during this year. If I heard you right, you decided you would be better to stay at home and save as much as you can because you\u2019ll need it next year, which sounds reasonable. That\u2019s obviously the pros of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">pros and cons. Do you see any cons about staying home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: I think, certainly, falling back into old habits of being too comfortable at home, like last year it ended up being that at home was safe and easy, so I didn\u2019t bother to venture out too much which I think is another good step about getting this part-time job and perhaps another full-time job. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">Another benefit of this job is putting me surrounded by other people my age, tutors and in other positions, at the venue I\u2019m working at. It\u2019s kind of putting me back into a situation where I\u2019m more attuned to making those connections and interacting with other younger people my age and putting myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200972\">in social situations outside the house. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it does sound like it\u2019s a situation that\u2019s beneficial in a lot of ways. You\u2019ve been home a while now. Have you felt that you were again settling into too comfortable? How has it been?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: I think that I have been more motivated this time around to not let that happen. I think probably because each time I\u2019ve done it before, there wasn\u2019t another opportunity elsewhere so I came back home; but this time I didn\u2019t pursue the one opportunity at that time. Because I felt I wasn\u2019t able <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">to take that opportunity at the time. I wasn\u2019t able to do that, so now I really need to focus and hone in on why it is that I didn\u2019t think I could do it at that time and then make sure I do something about it to ensure that this time I make sure I\u2019m ready to go and there are no issues. So far, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B2\">is a small step in that direction. Hopefully there will be other steps along the way that take me there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: So you want to focus on why you were so apprehensive, so reluctant to go last year? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yes. I think, along with speaking with you, doing things like tutoring and taking other opportunities and steps while I am here can help prepare me better and put me in a much better position to go and start the program next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Any specific ideas you have in mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: The idea was to get some work, put myself in more situations where I was engaging with other people, simply getting out of the house more.  At that time I was thinking even if it\u2019s volunteering at the local humane society or doing something like that, at least it\u2019s getting out of the house seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">people other than my parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Sounds like a real good start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yes. Obviously, the idea would have been full time. Number two would have been part time, and volunteering would have been the fallback option. Luckily with this part-time job I can still do volunteering if I choose, but there is the added benefit of getting out of the house and getting paid <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">while I do it. (pause) Slowly I\u2019m working towards taking good steps to achieving what I kind of had set out to be my goal when I first came home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: In terms of the goals that you\u2019ve articulated, you definitely seem like you\u2019re going in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m pleased with the way things have gone so far and, again, I don\u2019t want to get too comfortable on this and keep pushing to continue taking steps. This is just one step and I don\u2019t want to get comfortable here. Keep pushing myself to do more and more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Again in terms of your goals, you\u2019re in a real good place now. You\u2019ve got plans, specific plans for next year. You\u2019ve got clear objectives for this coming year to help you move towards what you\u2019re ultimately going to be doing next year. At this point, where do you see our work fitting in? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">What do you feel would be most beneficial for us to work on to help you achieve those goals?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I think one of the things that I have done in the past is when I have had these periods of anxiety, but then when I\u2019ve not felt them I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m not feeling those now, so I don\u2019t need to address and examine why and try and understand and manage why I get those feelings of anxiety.  I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">just get the feeling that if I\u2019m not feeling that way now, I don\u2019t need to worry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s very perceptive. Between times when you feel anxious it\u2019s easy to say you don\u2019t have to worry about that. You refer to the feelings of anxiety. When do you have those feelings most strongly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: It really just has been the past couple of times, like when I was in the Europe the last time facing the decision of do I accept or what happens when I\u2019m up for the place?  How do I accept it? How do I find accommodation\/housing? That\u2019s why I think the pattern has been when I\u2019ve been facing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">decisions \u2013 longer-term, bigger decisions as to what do I do next in terms of career or job or where do I live? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: As I recall, we talked last week I think about how when you got downsized in DC it really shook your self-confidence and subsequent to that, when you were faced with the decision of whether to go to school or not, you got more anxious than you\u2019ve ever been before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: I would say that it\u2019s probably fair to say the overwhelming feeling, the thought that dominated, was \u201cI can\u2019t do this right now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I can\u2019t do this right now. So the question is why can\u2019t you? Why did you think that you were not up to the task, the challenge? By the way, there\u2019s not a one-sentence answer to that question, but it is, if I\u2019m hearing you right, the path you want to really focus on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Certainly it\u2019s something that I haven\u2019t really addressed properly before so I think it\u2019s important that I do focus on that. I know there will be times in my life that I will \u2013 everyone gets nervous or a bit apprehensive and I\u2019m learning to have that conversation in my head before the one that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">has been the negative \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t do it\u201d and kind of pulling back. Up until now, at certain junctures in my life it certainly has had a negative impact and result, managing it to the point where I allow that anxiety to kind of rule my decision making. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: To put the question another way, and let\u2019s see if this resonates for you, why do you get so anxious faced with opportunities to be more independent and have more control of your life? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I guess it probably has a lot to do with thinking the negative, that if something goes wrong, probably self-doubts about my own abilities to deal with things that inevitably will go wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Things inevitably will go wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: The realistic thing is that in everyone\u2019s life, they\u2019re dealt difficult situations; and just my own self-doubt about how I independently deal with the difficult situations or things that don\u2019t go how I want them to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: What examples of that come to mind where you were faced with dealing with a situation on your own and things went wrong? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: I guess just (pause) the incident in DC where I know it was kind of the first time I was in the real world dealing with things more independently than I ever had before. Whether or not it was in my control, things still did break down and did not go the way I had hoped they would go at the time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">I guess a lot of it stems from that \u2013 the first major step I take into the real world didn\u2019t pan out properly or the way I had hoped or wanted it to pan out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Which sounds like regardless of what you thought intellectually, rationally, there was part of you that felt that it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the fact that there was a recession, it had to do with your personal failings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, a part of me, like you said, the rational part of me understands it, but the other part of me says that maybe there was something I could have done to influence a different outcome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Can you hear yourself saying that to yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the conversation I have, over-analyzing the situation to the point where I\u2019ll just nitpick at different situations thinking, \u201cOh, I could have done that,\u201d or looking back and thinking that I could have changed a decision I made or spent more time doing this or less time doing that.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Can you hear yourself saying that right now to yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t right now because I think right now I\u2019m in a better place and I am more able to look back and think that, for the most part, things were out of my control. Even if I had done \u2013 like you said, it wouldn\u2019t have changed the fact that there was a recession or that they still needed to cut <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">back. It was just a matter of who they were cutting back. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the rational you saying that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: See if you can imagine having that kind of conversation with yourself, where you\u2019re running yourself down, second-guessing yourself. You can imagine that right now. Any images coming to your mind\u2019s eye? Any images of anybody or anything? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Nobody in particular. I think the way my mind goes first is towards a negative side of things as opposed to looking on the brighter side, so I think just generally whenever something doesn\u2019t go ideally, I just think it\u2019s me.  Yeah, I think generally that\u2019s just the way my mind goes, as opposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB1\">to thinking that if something goes wrong, looking at ways to spin it into a positive, which I think is the goal. Instead of doing that, I look over what went wrong. Did I do wrong or what could I have changed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: When we talked about that last week you associated it with your mother being such a worrywart when you were growing up and you were experiencing that. Any more thoughts about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: No. I think the way she tends to be and I think I\u2019m much more like her.  I tend to be more like her side of things and the fact that I think she and I will try to plan, plan, plan, to try and plan out, so much that we try and plan for every possible difficulty or negative thing that could happen. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">And then if one of those does happen, the automatic assumption is \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I plan better to think to make sure that this didn\u2019t happen?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: So you do that typically when you\u2019re planning something? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yes. I would just plan, plan, plan, to try and weed out everything that could go wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Give me a concrete example because I want to try to get as clear a picture as I can in my mind of you and your mother sitting and doing that planning, what that\u2019s like. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to think. (pause) I\u2019m not really sure if I can think of a . . . (pause) I guess the thinking, when I first went off to university and I have had eye issues before, myself and in conjunction with my parents, I had organized my eye doctor.  I had kind of organized what would happen <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">if I needed to go to the eye doctor. I know it doesn\u2019t really make any sense, but even though I had planned for if something went wrong, still something went wrong. It was as if because I had planned so much \u2013 I knew where I was going, I knew how to get there, I knew the number to call on the way there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E72\">\u2013 even though I had planned for that eventuality if that would happen, somehow when it did happen it just felt like somehow maybe there was a different step I could have taken.  I know I can\u2019t control what happened with my eye, I think something in me still said I could have found my way into achieving <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E73\">a better result with the vision if I had done something differently, like going to see the doctor earlier could have prevented it. Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You mean going to see him before you even had a problem?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yes. Somehow if I had gone to see him earlier, I could have prevented it, even though I know there\u2019s nothing that could have been done now. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Correct me if this is not how it was, but it sounds like your thoughts were essentially \u201cI don\u2019t know what I could have done, but I could have done something better than I did.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yes. When I came home I kind of expressed this to my mom. That was a lot of my mother\u2019s feelings as well. She told me that her first instinct was to blame herself for something that happened to me when I was 1,000 miles away that she didn\u2019t have control over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Do you feel you\u2019ve acquired that reflex to blame yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: I think definitely, to a degree, I\u2019ve seen her do it and so I\u2019ve definitely taken some of that on board. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Are there any memories of particular instances where you experienced your mother blaming herself that really stand out for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Again, that\u2019s really the main one I always think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Going to college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Going to college. Her thoughts when I was with her, she felt that she was always able to manage and plan any negative outcome or any harm that might come to me; and so her first thought when this happened, her mind went to \u201che\u2019s gone off to university and within a couple of months something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">happened.\u201d  She kind of felt that the moment she relinquished a bit of control or the ability to plan, something went wrong. I think she did for a long time to a degree place a lot of blame on herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It sounds like the implication is also that something was going to go wrong and she should have planned better for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what her thoughts on that were, but she definitely felt like the minute I went away and some of her ability to plan things on my behalf was gone . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: So when she didn\u2019t have enough control over the situation, the something goes wrong. She should have had more control.  If I recall what you said earlier, when you anticipate doing something, when you start getting anxious, that one of the assumptions that you have is that something is bound <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201011\">to go wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve got to plan for it because it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Yes. I do try and think about what could go wrong and how I can plan around those things that could go wrong or how can I prevent those things that could go wrong from happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: If you\u2019re about to embark on some new activity or go to a new place or something, take on a new challenge, and you assume that something is going to go wrong, no wonder you get anxious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I think that it\u2019s kind of ironic that I think like that because the field of education is all about you plan, but then from experience and from talking with teachers and from my own experience, things never go according to plan. Somehow that I\u2019m all right with. I think it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">when managing my own life where I view it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s interesting. It occurs to me that there is the assumption that the way experts, expert teachers, would work or experts in any performance, the way they work is they have a plan, a theory, or it\u2019s planned out and they follow the plan and then they function at high level.  But in fact, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201091\">that\u2019s not the way experts work. Experts improvise because you have to constantly be adjusting to the feedback you\u2019re getting for the situation. In other words, you can never plan for everything. The secret of being good at something is being able to adjust to the unexpected things that come up. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201092\">hasn\u2019t been your assumption.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560768\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: No, certainly not with my own life, no.

So we know where we want to get to.  I think we\u2019re going to have to stop <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201151\">for now. With your new job, does the 10:00 time still work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: I head over there at about 2:00. I\u2019m a member of the Center so I can use any of the facilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: Oh, nice perk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019ll probably just head over there early and figure out what I\u2019ll do because for me now it\u2019s much easier for me to come here and then head straight over there as opposed to heading back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, this is on the way. Okay. See you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
