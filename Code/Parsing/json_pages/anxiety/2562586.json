Feel better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Much better, thank you. A quick thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been going around, definitely. Glasses? Whoa!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019ve always worn glasses. I have contacts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Awesome. I remembered two dreams, finally, that I just had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Last night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with Cecelia, but she\u2019s been waking me up at 5:00 AM, 5:30, and I have to get up. She will not stop meowing. It\u2019s throwing off an already-not-great sleep schedule. Then I try to get up and then I rally and am like I\u2019m up really early, great. It\u2019s impossible. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">By 9:00 AM I\u2019m just exhausted.  Anyway, after I\u2019ve fed her and played with her a little bit, when I fell back asleep I saw one dream where I could hear songs that were mine and it was me and my band, but I don\u2019t know those songs. They sounded good, so that was interesting. Then the weirder dream is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">that my friend, Diego, the one who is here from Assyria, the one who I\u2019m going to stay with when I go there and who has been visiting here these past few weeks. I had a dream that \u2013 I don\u2019t know if in the dream I knew this or not \u2013 but it was almost like some kind of psychiatric hospital that he had <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">taken me to and it was really weird; and then he disappeared.  I was there with these people that worked there and, at the same time, I\u2019ve been looking at it like frames, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Like glasses?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think. I started having this weird premonition that these people that were there were not believing me that I was there for a friend and that they were going to try and lock me up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Thinking that you were really the patient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: That I was really the crazy one or whatever. That was really weird. That didn\u2019t end up being the case. That was the funny thing. She finally took me in to see him, although this was weird, too. She took me in to see him, but when she opened the door he was just snoring; he was sleeping or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">At first I thought it was growling, but she opened the door and it was just totally dark and he was snoring.  There was something on the table for me that he had left or something. I don\u2019t fucking know. It was really weird and the people were really weird like \u2013 not caricatures, but grotesque, kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">of. This woman was like a dwarf or midget, very, very short, and had a weird red afro. (chuckles) It was weird, but I wasn\u2019t scared. I was just kind of . . . I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I have no fucking idea. My friend, Diego, has had mental problems years ago because they didn\u2019t know that he had that kind of epilepsy where you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re having a seizure. So he seemed totally normal, but he was having seizures. So it got to the point where it was really fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">his moods.  He\u2019s already one of these guys who \u2013 he\u2019s my age or younger \u2013 but he\u2019s always seemed like an old dude, like the way he dresses. You know how some people already seem a little curmudgeonly, like get-off-my-lawn kind of thing? So he always had that, but that\u2019s not a mental illness. But that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">thing, until they diagnosed it, he got put into a psych ward \u2013 not in a bad way. I think he volunteered himself, but it was bad until they diagnosed it. I don\u2019t know if that was just swirling somewhere in my mind, but then the snoring I was like wait, is that me? Because I do snore sometimes. Even if <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">that was me, what does that mean? I don\u2019t know.  The one thing I can think of is that (pause) \u2013 I just drew a blank \u2013 about going to Assyria and stuff. Everything feels so unreal. I think it has maybe something to do with that. I\u2019m not sure what. It must have something to do with it. I think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200254\">why I\u2019m seeing so many of these vivid dreams now because I still feel that it\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t feel as excited as I should feel. Maybe a part of me feels like I\u2019m not really going to go or it\u2019s really not real.  It seems like such a big change all of a sudden that it\u2019s not really sinking in on some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200255\">level. Like I\u2019ve been saying, I\u2019m just scared to go there if it doesn\u2019t work out \u2013 or if it does work out. And then the music, like with the band, that\u2019s a bummer. That\u2019s bumming me out, but there is no way around it. I can\u2019t stay here just for three guys that I like to play music with where we have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200256\">nothing going on. But that is kind of bumming me out. I feel like I\u2019m leaving that half-assed. I feel like did we really try as hard as we could? But like my friends have said, that\u2019s not about them, it\u2019s about me.  I could be trying anywhere as hard as I can. They are my songs so I\u2019m going to go play <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200257\">them wherever I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562586\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something more you wished you\u2019d done with this group, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I mean it just hasn\u2019t been that long and we sound good. It\u2019s just a bummer to have to give it up. I\u2019m not going to find people like that in Assyria. It\u2019s hard to find people that you also really enjoy spending time with and they just \u201cget\u201d you. In Assyria, it\u2019s probably going to be much more <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">like you play this; you play that. They\u2019re literally going to be a backing band, if I even have one, whereas this feels like a band. It\u2019s like a benevolent dictatorship, but they\u2019re talented guys. They know what to do because we just get it.  Then I\u2019m careful and wonder if I\u2019m using it as an excuse. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">They\u2019re just three guys I like playing music with. Am I going to give up a great opportunity to hang out behind the plumbing supply shop and play music? Yeah, that\u2019s great, but that\u2019s not . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling ambivalent about it in an unreal way right now, like you\u2019re second-guessing going? Has that crossed your mind? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just trying to [follow it through.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I guess a little bit. Everything feels surreal to me right now. It\u2019s hard. I can\u2019t find a better way to express it. Not surreal, just unreal; like what is going on? I\u2019m talking about moving in March? But it also makes sense. In a way, I feel like I\u2019m along for a ride that some other part of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">me has put together.  Do you know what I mean? It could be that it\u2019s the older, anxious side of me that\u2019s having trouble handling this other newer side that has made an opportunity for himself and makes perfect sense. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on or if I just legitimately feel like . . . I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Feel like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: If I\u2019m really ambivalent. But then it\u2019s like ambivalent about what? What am I doing here? It seems like it\u2019s more about just the change. I\u2019m scared of the change. What if I go there and I still don\u2019t write? What if I go there and I still feel whacky and I still sleep too much or something?  <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">Things really need to change and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m expecting too much change.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562586\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Are you setting yourself up for disappointment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. At the same time, things do need to change. It wasn\u2019t easy when I had this stupid job, but now I feel like I\u2019m adrift. There is no routine and as much as I try to make a routine, you need things. They don\u2019t have to be major things, but you need things to give you a routine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">I\u2019m hoping that something like that will happen over there. Or, if nothing else, I\u2019m hoping that things will be so different in terms of my social life that that, in and of itself, is a kind of routine.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Your dream where you were afraid that maybe you were the patient, in a way it\u2019s like there are two representations of you, feeling healthy and taking ownership and just visiting and feeling more powerful and empowered and doing this for all the right reasons, but you\u2019re unsure and sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">have to say \u201cno, but I\u2019m not the patient and I\u2019m worried.\u201d What if this other side is there, too? What if you get there and this isn\u2019t real about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)  On some level, maybe what\u2019s happening \u2013it\u2019s a bit dramatic \u2013 and I have a feeling that what\u2019s happening, is that there is something in me that feels like it\u2019s now or never in terms of all this shit I say about being an artist and this and that. Yeah, that\u2019s true; but something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">in me feels like it\u2019s now or never. Either you\u2019re going to take it to another level or \u2013 there is a reality. Yeah, I\u2019m sure you can still do shit when you\u2019re in your 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. Of course you can, but you\u2019re in your prime. While you\u2019re still fairly young and you have your fucking wits about you and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">you have nothing anchoring you down \u2013 come on. Either you sit down and you make shit happen or you don\u2019t. That\u2019s scary because so far I\u2019m not. I keep saying that, but I\u2019m not. So I\u2019m worried that even a big change like that \u2013 because then there\u2019s no answer. Then I don\u2019t have an answer after that. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200393\">don\u2019t know if I need to take a shitload of Aterol or . . . (laughs)  Because it can\u2019t be that I\u2019m not talented. I know enough to know that I\u2019m not the most talented, but I\u2019m talented in whatever spectrum. So it\u2019s not that. I think something in me is trying to really battle it out. Especially in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200394\">last few weeks I\u2019ve been feeling it. Part of me is like I just want to get up and read that book, but I don\u2019t. (chuckles) I can taste it, but something in me here is just not . . . I don\u2019t know what the fuck it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Maybe what\u2019s frightening about it, then, is thinking that somehow it\u2019s going to be different just because you change locations and it feels like can that really be true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s part of it. A nine-hour zone difference \u2013 I\u2019m still me. But then I keep thinking that it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Because it did in London. It still didn\u2019t go all the way to where I wanted it to, but it was a start. Chances are if I had had a job there and stayed there, then that was going to continue. But because I had to do this keep-coming-back and I couldn\u2019t get into a real blossom, I couldn\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">come out. If I had stayed there when the book was done, then who knows? I would have still been there and Jason would have still really been pushing me instead of now we really have no contact.  He doesn\u2019t even get back to me now. Those things would have kept pushing me out. Instead I regressed to family <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">and this stupid routine and this shitty job and not challenging myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562586\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: And because there wasn\u2019t money, do you think? Like had there been the money to support you being there, you don\u2019t think you would have come back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, if they were like \u201cjust teach here.\u201d If it were like the Assyrian situation where it was real money, not just this chump-change money then, of course, of course I would. Then there wouldn\u2019t be such a break. I would come to Darien and in the summer I\u2019ll stay in Darien and then I\u2019ll go back, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">especially from there. Jesus, it\u2019s like six or seven hours, like from here to Oregon; it\u2019s nothing. But western Europe is not a joke, unless you\u2019re some 20-year-old who is just going to live on tuna fish and live in a shit-box and work under the table; that\u2019s not me. It\u2019s a very, very expensive place. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">Especially because I was already going there in debt, so that didn\u2019t feel great already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Brian, that\u2019s also a big factor to keep in mind about a kind of thing that can be inhibitory when moving forward in your life pursuits, is money. It didn\u2019t ever sound like the reason why you left there was because you had regressed. That may have been what eventually happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t say it was because I regressed, I meant that because I had to come back because of the money, once I was back it\u2019s a trap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Getting sucked into [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:00), too.  But the idea that this plan you have has money involved \u2013 yes, it could happen if this job doesn\u2019t come through and they all of a sudden say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We have no teaching opportunities.\u201d And six months go by and there is nothing, certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">there is a chance of that if you don\u2019t have a contract and suddenly it\u2019s impossible to get a contract. It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s very likely that\u2019s going to happen, so assuming you get to teach a couple of courses or three courses or four courses, it\u2019s so different. You will have money. I think one <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">of the things that means that it\u2019s not just a location cure, which is a fantasy, is more along the line of financially being really independent. Having money often means symbolically being able to forge your own identity once and for all, not being tied to mom and dad and sort of building the feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B3\">of indebtedness and loyalties. It breaks that tie with your mom in a way that I think allows you to just really embrace you.  You\u2019re still scared thinking, \u201cOkay, what if, given that chance, what if even with money I don\u2019t write? What does that mean then? Who am I?\u201d And you\u2019ll cross that bridge when <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B4\">you come to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Maybe there is this ultimate battle going on. It\u2019s the older, regressed side that\u2019s so lulled into this cocoon that I have in this area between family and friends and this little, in some ways, very comfortable life. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562586\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What if you were going to try to make yourself do something that you haven\u2019t been able to do again in a really effortful way in preparation? [Trying to get the motivation running?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening, even subconsciously. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I suddenly have this desire like \u201cI just want to read this book.\u201d I think that is happening. Just my thinking it, I think, is a good start because in the past I was thinking it, but not really, kind of scatterbrained. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">But now I feel this weird pull. Not a need, but a desire to; maybe that\u2019s what I didn\u2019t feel in the past. I felt a desire to feel a desire. I wanted to want to, but now I just want. That book is interesting. I just want to see what\u2019s going on here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: What book? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: It\u2019s because of this fricking dissertation that I\u2019m not really writing. There is this Assyrian-American who teaches nearby, I think. It\u2019s basically the book I would have written, kind of. It\u2019s modernism, trauma and poetry. It\u2019s not about Assyrians, but he has one or two chapters that deal with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">Assyrian genocide. It\u2019s not just Armeno-centric. That\u2019s a book I should read.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: So what stopped you on that book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: I have no idea. That\u2019s the thing, I never know. I think I\u2019m just lulled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just too comfortable here or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re in bed the book is there. Why not look at it in bed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t concentrate or something or I\u2019m worried that I can\u2019t concentrate. It\u2019s become a viscous cycle. That goes back to what I was saying way before when I thought that maybe it\u2019s ADD.  Except for a few years when I was a teenager, I just have such a history of not being able to concentrate <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">that it\u2019s just become a self-fulfilling thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: But you did it as a teenager?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Kind of. I did but I didn\u2019t though. I coasted through high school. I don\u2019t remember doing any homework. I would just get good grades. I don\u2019t know how.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just saying that with your writing you seem so focused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, writing poetry and stuff I was more motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Sending it out, following through with all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, there were a few years, so I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because of PTSD once my dad died. That must be a PTSD thing where if it\u2019s drastic something just gets shut off or paralyzed or you just can\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So is that what it is, the paralysis?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, like something in me just can\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel the joy I used to feel like \u201cOh, cool. I\u2019m going to get on the bus and go to a caf\u00e9\u201d and I would just sit there and I would read. I\u2019m sure I was distracted here and there, but no Internet and no cell phones. I would just sit there and I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">read [Camus] (ph?) or something. I would underline shit and stuff that I totally didn\u2019t understand. That just went out the window when my dad died. Whatever that joy was of just doing that went out the window.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: That kind of vitality?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Exactly, and not caring what page I was on or whether I should read the whole book. That just went out the window, totally out the window.  And then, unfortunately, that\u2019s a bad combo to conflate that kind of paralysis with this academic bullshit because then it really asking for self-flagellation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">because now you\u2019ve got to read these dry, bullshit books that you don\u2019t really want to read. So then it becomes a viscous cycle. Then I\u2019m not a good scholar. I don\u2019t know what to write in this paper. I have nothing to say, so I end up writing these half-assed papers. I think that has just become deep-seated <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200752\">and I don\u2019t find pleasure.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562586\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: I wonder what it would be like to just try it between today and tomorrow and see what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have a book with me in my bag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Even if it\u2019s just a chapter and even if it doesn\u2019t work, then pay attention to what\u2019s going on inside.  What do you get distracted with? What does it feel like? Are there feelings that come up with you when you read?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: The one concrete thing that I know does happen \u2013 the other stuff is more deeply psychological \u2013 is I have so much going on, so it\u2019s hard to do one thing at a time. That\u2019s more of a logistical, practical problem that I have. So if I\u2019m working on songs I can kind of focus, kind of, but writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">and the PhD and all that I\u2019m like \u201cI should be sending poems out.\u201d But then, of course, I don\u2019t send out poems. My mind just goes in very different directions instead of just being like \u201cI will send poems out. Right now I\u2019m going to read this chapter, but then I\u2019ll send some poems out.\u201d For whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D2\">reason . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: You get overwhelmed quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Very quickly. Even before I open the book I\u2019m already . . . And then that, of course, saps the joy. I feel fucking tired. My PhD is not done. What am I going to say? I\u2019ve got nothing to say. This guy already wrote the book. What the fuck? That\u2019s the other thing, I probably shouldn\u2019t have even <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">probably gone to grad school. I have nothing to say. Even if I do it\u2019s not in this academic, scholarly, bazillion-footnotes way, but here I am. There is no other way to finish this fucking thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: So those voices are also really important in potentially hampering you from even writing the book. How about you say you\u2019re not allowed to do anything else but read a chapter in that book? You cannot send out poems today. That\u2019s the only thing. See what happens and see what it brings up, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">even if you don\u2019t do it, and we\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Okay. All right. Thanks Claire. See you again. Have a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
