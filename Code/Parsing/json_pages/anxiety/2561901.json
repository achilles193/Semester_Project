I need to notify them by June 1st, and the rent was going up from $1,375 to $1,400. I talked to my mom, and so she said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">don\u2019t sign it. If you don\u2019t get a job by the time your lease is up, you need to move back. They don\u2019t have enough money to support me anymore. So I\u2019m just \u2013 It\u2019s totally understandable. I wish they hadn\u2019t let me move into this apartment in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: How come?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I guess \u2018cause I\u2019ll have to move again. And I assume that if they let me move in that it was going to be okay. I thought they knew that I probably wouldn\u2019t find a job right away. I\u2019ve got a prospective part-time job, but it wouldn\u2019t start for a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Is that part of the equation with your parents, or do they know about that? [1:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I asked about it. Because the thing is, it\u2019s like, $15.00 an hour, 20 hours a week, which is actually just about as many hours as I ended up getting at the museum and $2.00 an hour more pay, and it\u2019s a work from home thing. So, no gas or anything. With that, she said, she had to talk to Dad. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">I don\u2019t know that I actually have it yet. Basically, it\u2019s \u2013 When I was at the wedding, I was talking to my friend, Leslie about how I was between jobs and she \u2013 I guess a bunch of her friends, she\u2019s directed them to \u2013 Nokia has this Internet research thingy where you\u2019re doing things with their apps <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">and trying to make their application better by checking the accuracy of locations and stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And so, it\u2019s something that her mom\u2019s been doing, and her mom really likes finding people for the job, and they look for people with graduate degrees. They are also looking for people who are between jobs and stuff like that. So pretty much exactly what I am. So I was like, that sounds really good. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">[3:11] So she gave me her mom\u2019s info and then I e-mailed her mom and her mom was like, you sound like a good fit, you know, like the X person. And so I e-mailed the X person. The thing is that like, because this is so popular, there is a two-month queue which Leslie told me about going in. So I won\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">find out for another two months if I\u2019ve got it. And they do train you and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: But you have to wait to get the answer for quite a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve seen help wanted signs in places. I\u2019m not sure if getting a retail job would also be enough, because I assume it wouldn\u2019t pay enough to pay my rent, even if I worked 40 hours a week. I guess if it paid $10.00 an hour and I worked 40 hours a week, I could conceivably <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">make $200 an hour more than my rent. Not $200 an hour, $200 a month more than my rent. And that wouldn\u2019t quite be enough to cover everything else. [4:25] Like, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a conversation \u2013 you need to sort of find out really what the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I think I need a real job, which only gives me \u2018til June. And I guess if I find one by August, I can move into another place, but I need to find one by June, though and to not have to move again, and I don\u2019t see that happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Have you been applying for things this past week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019ve just been so busy getting ready for Passover, I didn\u2019t have a chance. And like, Friday we actually went down to Connecticut to get the kitten that we were adopting. [5:14] And I \u2013 Saturday was Shabbat and I didn\u2019t want to apply to jobs on Shabbat. Sunday we were doing all the grocery <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">shopping and Monday we were also doing all the grocery shopping. And we were preparing for the Seder. We actually \u2013 Sydney cut himself really badly on the finger. We ended up in the ER.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow. Is he okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: He\u2019s okay. I had called \u2013 It\u2019s good that I had called. It\u2019s like, I was trying to see if the Yale Vanguard in Wareham is a three minute was from his place would see patients for that sort of thing. They got me to the clinician. The clinician had me have him run his finger under cold water for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">ten minutes and compress the wound and elevate it above his heart level. [6:08] Stuff I would not necessarily have known to do all that before going to the ER. There was a two-hour block in which the finger could be saved, and so we got him in in time. Yeah. That was kind of hectic and it\u2019s also why <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">I\u2019m incredibly tired this morning, because the Seder lasted late because we started late. Luckily his friend Janet came over and Melanie also came over. And so as soon as they got there, they came right as we were about to needed to be going. So it was like, we took over the food while we went to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">ER. Most of the cooking had been done. But I didn\u2019t get to bed until like, 3:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Very late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: It is very later. I don\u2019t know. Now I\u2019m scared of having to move back in with my parents, or having to move again. 7:13] And I just don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to find something. It\u2019s so hard to make myself apply for one of these positions. It seems like, you know, there may be something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">I can do, but I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m an especially good candidate for any of them. And there\u2019s one I need to look a little bit more into it and see if I\u2019m an actually a good candidate where I at least know someone who works in the department. Like, in that networking. It might already be too late for that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">one. It\u2019s like a digital thingy. I always feel weird with applying for digital stuff. Because, you know, they say, have experience with digitization and I have experience with the stuff you do after you\u2019ve like, scanned the pages, and I don\u2019t have scanning experience, so I feel like, scanning experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">is something you can get like, you know, it\u2019s something you can have undergrads do. So it\u2019s not like it requires extensive training. So I don\u2019t know if that really counts as digitization experience or if I\u2019m mis-selling myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s your job to sell yourself. [8:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: It\u2019s my job to sell myself. It\u2019s not my job to mis-sell myself. I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I mean, I guess that\u2019s where the interview comes in, to see if you\u2019re actually qualified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">TEHRAPIST: Yeah. And also to gain more clarification. So it\u2019s something what your \u2013 in this particular instance. You\u2019re picking apart phases, parts, digitization experience. You have some. Do you have experience with every single phase of it? No. But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Well, it might mean I don\u2019t have experience, because digitization might be only considered the stuff that\u2019s scanning -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: See how you\u2019re picking it apart? That\u2019s the piece that you can talk about in the interview and find out more. But the first phase is more broad than that. The cover letter doesn\u2019t give you a lot of room about specifics, or for them to ask really detailed questions. They\u2019re giving you a broad <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">sketch. Here\u2019s the types of things we want you to have experience in. And I think the first phase is to answer the broad questions in the way that you can. And if you get past that \u2013 I mean, you\u2019re not going to go into the interview and say, I have tons of experience with scans. [9:42] If you get an <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">interview, you go into the interview and say, I feel confident that I could learn to scan appropriately. I\u2019ve done this piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I guess that\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s a thing required of a job or that\u2019s the main aspect of the job. It makes me a little bit more worried. And this is, you know, digitization assistant or whatever. Maybe even like, head of digitization. Or probably not head of it. I don\u2019t think it would apply to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">a head of position. But, you know, where the digital media librarian. That\u2019s probably closer to what it was. It was a few days ago that I saw this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You can say what feels true for you. I\u2019m not telling you to lie in a cover letter or resume. Say what feels true for you. But it sounds like what you\u2019re actually doing, is you\u2019re talking yourself out of having to apply, because you\u2019re not sure that you meet exactly what they might be thinking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">And I think what your job is, is to present yourself and sell yourself. Talk about what your strengths are. I\u2019m not telling you to misrepresent yourself. There\u2019s a difference between selling yourself, which is making the experience that you have and the ability and aptitude to learn what other things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">you might need. [11:02] That\u2019s what selling yourself is. It\u2019s looking at what you actually have, and making them aware of what your strengths are. It\u2019s not misrepresenting. And you can talk about what you have experience in without necessarily having experience in everything you think they might want. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B3\">Highlight the good stuff. That\u2019s what advertising is about. And cover letters and resumes are about advertising your good stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: I want a job. I feel bad spending any money right now. So even something part-time would \u2013 Like, even if the part-time job weren\u2019t enough to keep me in the apartment, I\u2019d still at least not feel bad about spending money on things that aren\u2019t like, rent and food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It would give you a lot more freedom and independence, which is what you\u2019ve been seeking. [12:06] You do have to go through this process to get one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: I still have to write the person from the Worcester Polytech library. I just don\u2019t want that commute. And I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s \u2013 I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to e-mail her. I don\u2019t know. I think at this point it was two or three weeks ago that I heard about the crazy \u2013 the person being <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">fired and the crazy upheaval. I assume it would have all been settled in the course of two weeks. It\u2019s just so hard to get the motivation to \u2013 I mean, I guess writing her a letter is a lot easier than writing a cover letter. I guess I could -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">TEHRAPIST: And it\u2019s not committing yourself to a commute. It\u2019s seeking information about what might be available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just wondering if I should go the route like \u2013 So when I was actually working at the hardware store for the days that I came in when my parents were in Jordan that was in Connecticut. I actually enjoyed what I was doing. And I think most of the reason I hated being in the store growing up <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">was \u2013 Well, A, they had a really, really old, out-of-date, horrible, horrible point of sale operating system for their cash register. So if you messed up, you had to do all this crazy stuff. [13:27] Well, I guess it wasn\u2019t crazy so much as wait for someone with proper authorization to come and fix it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">while you have a line of customers waiting to t be checked out, which puts pressure on the cashier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">And so that, plus my grandma, you know, who wanted me to do things like vacuum the linoleum floor which, you know, it was a pain in the butt to do. We felt really silly. Why are we not sweeping and mopping the floor. And you\u2019d be clicking and clacking on the tiles. Or if like, I had some downtime like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">if I was working back office, she\u2019d be like, oh, do something else. She wouldn\u2019t let anyone else have any downtime at all. Always being on my feet when I was at the register and stuff. I need you like five minutes every so often downtime. Just working for her was like a nightmare, but I really liked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">my actual manager, Lily. She was the one I\u2019ve been working with now. [14:36] And maybe I should like, just go into the working at the hardware store and taking over the store when my parents retire in a few years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a valid option, correct?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a valid option, though it feels like a bit of a waste of two master\u2019s degrees. And I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d also have to get an MBA. I probably \u2013 My dad got an MBA, but then again, before that, my grandfather and his brother were the ones who owned the store. I don\u2019t even know if my grandpa <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">when to college. I\u2019m 99 percent sure he didn\u2019t have an MBA. I\u2019m like, 90 percent sure he didn\u2019t go to college. And I think the same is true of Uncle Wyatt. [15:30] So they didn\u2019t have MBA to work at the store. So maybe I don\u2019t actually need an MBA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Whose decision would that be? Whose requirement would that be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: I guess my dad\u2019s. Actually, I don\u2019t even know if Harry has an MBA, and they co-own the store. I think when my dad got his MBA it wasn\u2019t to run the store, it was to do accounting stuff which doesn\u2019t even \u2013 Wait, well he had CPA stuff, too. My mom also got an MBA and she was working for Mobil <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">Oil. They didn\u2019t get it because of the hardware store. So it may just be completely tangential that they have MBAs. But if I did that I\u2019d possibly have to live in Connecticut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Can you envision your life with that path? How would that feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: I think I wouldn\u2019t mind the day-to-day work of going to the store. Then it would be whether or not Sydney would come with me to Connecticut. I think he doesn\u2019t want to leave Boston. And just, there are so few people my age in Stamford. And I think it\u2019s a better place to live when you\u2019re maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">a young family or something like that. And the Jewish community there. I guess there is a conservative synagogue and a reform synagogue, but the main Jewish community that I know is all like, super orthodox. [17:09] I guess if I wanted to have the hour commute, five days a week, I could live in New <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200532\">Haven or possibly if I did something south of Rhode Island like New Port, yeah. If the hardware store was in Rhode Island, it would be a lot \u2013 a much easier decision to make.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">TEHRAPIST: I notice that you\u2019re including Sydney in that. Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about? Whether or not you want to stay with him or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean the whole thing that I left unsaid was that if I did break up with Sydney, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be able to find someone else in Connecticut. Because, you know, the Jewish or converting to Jewish men my age, that have similar interests to me. I don\u2019t even know if there are any of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">them in Stamford. I\u2019ve never met any of them in Stamford before. [18:09] So I think it would be. And there are less job opportunities in general for people. So either way, whether or not I stayed with Sydney, it would probably mess with my dating life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">THERAPIST: So what\u2019s your gut sense as you think about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. On the other hand, it\u2019s like guaranteed income, you know. I mean, I guess my dad had to take a pay cut in one point in life in 2008 and hasn\u2019t gotten it back, but he still like, making somewhere between $70.000 and $100,000 a year, which it would take a while for me to get that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B1\">as a librarian or archivist. And that assumes finding a job in the first place. I mean, it\u2019s not a decision I\u2019d have to make right now. And I could continue to like \u2013 I guess I could keep it in the back of my mind if I continue fail getting jobs in my field. [19:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019d have to make a commitment to try to find jobs in your field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just all my friends are up at New Haven. Then yet a lot of my friends have moved away. But I have two friends in Connecticut. Two. That\u2019s it. I guess the living in Connecticut thing probably outweighs any benefit from even if I actually like the work and stuff. And they\u2019d only give me the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">store if I actually wanted to work there. They wouldn\u2019t just like, have it to manage it. Otherwise, they\u2019re selling it. I feel kind of ad, because it\u2019s a family business. I really, really don\u2019t want to live in Connecticut. And Stamford is nice enough, but there\u2019s not a huge crowd of highly educated <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F2\">nerdy people that hang out together and stuff. [20:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: And you feel like you have that here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: I have that here. It would just be really hard to make friends there. I guess then that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">TEHRAPIST: That sounds like your answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: Then that\u2019s really the way to sort of sift through it and see how you feel, and then basing your decision on those feelings that come up. It sounds like you feel pretty hesitant about the idea of moving close enough to make that job feasible and wanting to commit, really commit to the store <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">in a way more than just managing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and there aren\u2019t any like, good places. Like, you know, there might be \u2013 there\u2019s in between there\u2019s Rhonda which has a big Jewish community, but I want to live in the city. I want to live where there\u2019s public transportation and things to do. I grew up in suburbs. I don\u2019t have any interest <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B1\">in living in suburbs. Even providence is a city that seems kind of somewhere between city and suburb. [21:54] \u2018Cause like, there\u2019s lots of residential areas where people have single unit houses with lawns. And there\u2019s also not much public transportation. They have a bus system, but I don\u2019t even know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B2\">if it really goes to place I\u2019d need to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: So if you\u2019re ruling that out, you need to rule in something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: I think it starts with pursuing the few options and writing that e-mail or letter to the person at WPI, and seeing what comes of that. You know, it\u2019s not committing to something yet. But opening up that line of communication and then really following through on any job postings you see that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200711\">you are, you know, a somewhat match for. I don\u2019t think you need to restrict yourself to applying for things that you feel you\u2019re the perfect match for. Because there\u2019s a lot room for interpretation. Sometimes, they don\u2019t have one particular candidate in mind. Or sometimes, the description is a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200712\">bit hard to really know exactly what would be a good fit, and not to talk yourself out of things. [23:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. It would be really nice to have a permanent job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">TEHRAPIST: It would feel like a relief, I bet. I imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: It just seems so far away and impossible. Like I\u2019m not capable of getting one, you know. Or just like the market is so oversaturated here. Because it is. And I don\u2019t really know what I have to offer or any other archivists here, especially the ones who had permanent positions and stuff before. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">You know, and I don\u2019t even know that I\u2019m that much more qualified than the people who are newly coming out of library school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: You certainly don\u2019t sound very confident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: No. I was really good at my job when I had my job. But it was a really easy job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Do you hear how you talk yourself down? [24:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: But it was. I had pretty much one responsibility for 80 percent of the time I was there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s what they needed done. That was the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Real jobs have like, lots of different responsibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">TEHRAPIST: Some jobs have more variation than others. You don\u2019t know that you wouldn\u2019t be good at something else. What you know is you had that job in the field and you performed well. That\u2019s good. It doesn\u2019t mean that you wouldn\u2019t also do well at something else, or that there isn\u2019t something else that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">might be focused in that way. [25:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: It\u2019s true. I mean, I\u2019d rather in theory have a job with different responsibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: It would be less boring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Especially like, when I got to the point that I was working on the creating new arch records and typing things up. And then, you know, after a while, my hands would hurt. So if I had a job with different responsibilities, then I could, you know, switch over to something that wasn\u2019t hurting my hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Think about the possibilities of how things might work, rather than thinking about how they might not. Because you don\u2019t really know. It\u2019s going to be a constant process of seeing what\u2019s out there. You know, you can\u2019t look out into the future and know exactly what\u2019s going to appear <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">next week\u2019s or next month\u2019s job postings. [26:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just so depressed an unmotivated. I need to like, at least now I know. I think if I get out of the house and go to a space that like, you know, like a caf\u00e9 or whatever, I\u2019ll probably be better at getting something done. And now I actually have to do that, because when I open up the laptop <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">and put it on my lap, the cat will often run across the keyboard, pressing keys. And he could make all sorts of typos in my work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: Is there a place you\u2019d like to go? Do you have a coffee shop?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: I guess like, there\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether or not. I think probably coming down to at the square would give me the most options. Maybe like, the Starbucks, like a really big one. There\u2019s also the Panera on Porter that\u2019s really close by. They have smoothies there. So there could also be. There <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">are a few options. [27:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">Yeah. Maybe creating a little bit of routine to get to one and get used to the idea of spending an hour or two looking at what\u2019s there and writing a cover letter. It\u2019s just now I also don\u2019t trust myself. You know, I feel like when I write a cover letter, I want to send it out right away while I still <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200951\">have the motivation. But on the other hand, because I did have those typos on my resume that time, I don\u2019t know if I really can trust myself to send anything out that will be good without like, proofreading it. Ideally, like, you know, it\u2019s one thing to have people proofread your first few cover letters <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200952\">when you\u2019re getting used to writing them. But ideally, you should be able to like, once you have text that you use for a lot of things, be able to recycle it and send out \u2013 You know, write a cover letter in 20 minutes. [28:11] I read online a good cover letter should take 20 minutes. Cover letters always <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200953\">take me longer than that, and even longer if I have a \u2013 I don\u2019t even know who I\u2019d have look at it at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">THERAPIST: Who would you trust to look at it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">CLIENT: Well, I would trust Kim, but she has a job now, so I wouldn\u2019t think she would have the time. I guess possible Bridget, since like, she\u2019s just doing freelance work. So she would probably be willing to look at cover letters for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe start with one. There\u2019s this one job that you mentioned. Rather than planning out how it\u2019s going to go for everything, maybe getting yourself going with one. And ask if Bridget might read one. [29:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">CLIENT: I really wish I could do this all without \u2013 I wish I were good enough at proofreading my own work, but then I always \u2013 I will inevitably miss something, because I\u2019m used to seeing everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to proof your own work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve just gotten so many e-mails. When I was having a good run of applying to things and then like, at this point I was getting something from all of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">TEHRAPIST: It\u2019s frustrating not to go positive responses. I know it\u2019s hard to keep going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard to make all the cover letters sound excited. And so I sort of fell back on ones that were less excited and were to the point and got all the information out and with those cover letters, I think they weren\u2019t good enough, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t get interviewed. Or, it could be that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">they didn\u2019t feel I was a good enough candidate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">THERAPIST: How did you make the other ones sound more excited? [30:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">CLIENT: I talked about \u2013 I was sort of basing it off \u2013 Like, there was one that I found online that \u2013 but I can\u2019t copy and paste it and stuff easily with Google mobile. Starting off talking about how excited for the position and stuff and how I\u2019d \u2013 The thing with that cover letter that I \u2013 the thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A91\">that had been the model for a good cover letter is they don\u2019t really get into their experience or anything like that. It\u2019s just like, as you can see from my resume that I\u2019d be a good fit. And here\u2019s why I\u2019d be excited to work for you. But also, I\u2019m not even sure if that works if, for the hiring systems <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A92\">that you see find keywords of things. You know, so it\u2019s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Well, you could maybe put in a few. As you can see from my resume, I have experience in \u2013 And maybe put a few of those key skill words. Meshing a little bit. And then maybe showing your enthusiasm. Like, I\u2019d be really excited to learn, and maybe some of the things that you think the job would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB1\">might provide you with new experiences in. And get some of that keyword stuff in there to cover that angle, while also showing that you\u2019re interested in a specific position. The things that you have that match the specific position. [31:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess the ones that I did that sounded like those were the one that had the archeology experience and the one that had nautical museum experience. And the rest of them didn\u2019t have anything particular that I could pick up on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Content wise. What about skill wise? Because there\u2019s the content, and then there\u2019s also the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">CLIENT: I mean, I had the skills for all of them, I thought. I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Because this is something that you\u2019ve been working on, I\u2019ve been doing a little bit of reading. And one of the things that I noticed talked about in a couple of some of the sort of, you know, who gets hired job searching stuff for this current age. Is that because so many people are applying <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B31\">online. People apply to a lot more things. Positions get a lot more applications. Looking for ways to make yourself stand out. So most people are going to talk about the skills they have that are specific to the job, right? [32:54] I mean, that\u2019s pretty cut and dried. So also, having a little something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B32\">that shows about your unique personality interests to make yourself memorable was something that was mentioned a lot. So talking about some of the interests you have outside of the workplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">CLIENT: I mean, I can see why that would make sense, but I\u2019m wondering how that would play out in terms of, yon know, it should still at least be somewhat related to like, a skill that\u2019s like transferrable, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Well, you know I\u2019m sure \u2013 I\u2019m just kind of relaying some of what I\u2019ve read. And it seemed to me like, one of the things they were talking about was they just want a way to remember people. So not necessarily \u2013 Yes, absolutely, if you\u2019re thinking about a cover letter with a few paragraphs, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B71\">that most of those paragraphs, you know, those first couple of paragraphs are about this specific job. And the last one is sort of like a getting to know you paragraph. And, you know, in addition to my time at the job, I\u2019d also love to spend time doing blah, blah, blah. You know, just as a way to create <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B72\">a little bit of a personal connection. [34:17] So I don\u2019t know if this is something, or you\u2019ve certainly have talked to other people that are doing this and have read other examples -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s all stuff I\u2019ve heard before. And I could see it working. I could also see it coming across as gimmicky. I mean, I guess it wouldn\u2019t really hurt that much to try it a couple of times and see what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe try playing with writing it and see how it feels for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like I\u2019d need to \u2013 I mean, I guess like, knitting and swing dancing are probably like, safe interests. Yeah. I could probably. I mean, \u2018cause knitting has a whole attention to detail and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">TEHRAPIST: Yeah. So maybe finding ways to connect it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">CLIENT: I need to see it in a cover letter to see how it works, I think. [35:16] \u2018Cause there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s highly skeptical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I hear that. And you know, I\u2019m not a career coach. I know that this is something that you struggled with a long time before you got the whaling museum job and you\u2019re back in the space. So I tried to do a little bit of reading to see what people are saying. \u2018Cause it\u2019s certainly \u2013 this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C31\">a common problem in today\u2019s job market. And people are \u2013 lots of people are feeling stressed out about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m just wishing like, wondering if there is a field that\u2019s easier to get into that doesn\u2019t require moving to Connecticut. I\u2019d rather work as an admin assistant at like, random place X here than move to Connecticut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, that is good to know for yourself. [36:10] In the beginning of the session you were kind of talking about moving to Connecticut and working at your parents\u2019 store as a possible option. And it sounded like, the more you think about it, the more that really doesn\u2019t feel like a good option <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C71\">for you. But it\u2019s not an option to not have a job past June, really. So if that\u2019s not going to be the direction you go, then really working hard to secure yourself some position that keeps you in this area is your task.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019s possible. Especially like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to make the June deadline, so I think the August deadline is the more realistic one to aim for. Just \u2018cause like, if I sent out ten cover letters this week like, I\u2019d feel like it would take a few weeks to get to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C91\">interview stage. [37:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And that puts you in May.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">CLIENT: May. And then, you know, probably a few more weeks to get to the finding out whether you got it stage, which would take us to June and the deadline for \u2013 I mean, I guess it is entirely possible that no one will take my apartment right away and I could like, still get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">TEHRAPIST: With that timeline, it\u2019s also entirely possible that if there was someIf you did apply to a bunch of things and got a possible response, you could know by June.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">CLIENT: By June 1st though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: These are details that nobody can predict. If something\u2019s open now \u2013 But the first part of that sentence was, if I sent out ten, you know. And it\u2019s not that ten is the magic number. It\u2019s that, if you sent out cover letters. Because it sounds like what\u2019s actually been happening in the recent <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D31\">past is that you\u2019re not seeking out jobs. You\u2019re thinking about jobs. [38:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve read like, descriptions of jobs, I just haven\u2019t put them into a cover letter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Reading descriptions of jobs doesn\u2019t get you a job. Doesn\u2019t get you an option for the job. You have to contact people. Wanting a job. Reading job postings doesn\u2019t put you anywhere in a position to get you an offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561901\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB\">THERAPIST: If you want \u2013 If you really want to try to meet that deadline or even try to meet the August deadline, you have to put yourself in the position to get an interview or an offer. So that\u2019s what we need to focus on. What\u2019s going to get you to motivate, to take that step of actually job seeking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s the motivation of not wanting to move to Rhode Island, even temporarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF\">THERAPIST: So you have to translate that into action this week. Even with Passover, you can still do work on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">CLIENT: Well, Wednesday night. [39:19] So really, just Thursday and Friday. I mean, I guess Thursday and Friday is enough time that I can actually like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Those are two full days that you can take active steps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And even Wednesday night. You\u2019re not going to have a ton of hours, but-.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">CLIENT: I mean, think it would like it wouldn\u2019t be \u2013 I think with the holiday is like at 8:00 and I was like, hoping to go swing dancing, because I need to get the exercise, too. So I think (inaudible at 39:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t realize it was that late already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is. Thursday is rehearsal, but not until late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s plenty of time. And if you go to that coffee shop and focus, it doesn\u2019t have to be a ton of hours. It needs to be a productive, focused time to take some action. And I think if you set yourself up for success by getting out, being focused, not taking yourself out of it. You can do <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF1\">it. So shoot for that both Thursday and Friday to actually have some active product in the direction that you want. Why don\u2019t we wrap up there? I know we have it scheduled for (inaudible at 40:53)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">CLIENT: So next week you\u2019re out of town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Next week I\u2019m out of town, and I think we scheduled for the 28th at 2:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">CLIENT: Let me see if I have that on my calendar. I should. It is not on my calendar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Does that work for you? Monday, the 28th at 2:30? And then, for May I can do that sort of regular Monday at 2:30 spot every week except for the 26th, which is Memorial Day and I\u2019m out of the office that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">CLIENT: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Okay.
