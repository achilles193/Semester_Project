How does that work? Like did you already book your time or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I did already fill the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Okay, no worries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: If I didn\u2019t fill the time, you could have [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: No worries. No problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Were you staying around [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. We\u2019ve got to this is one of those rare days lately where we\u2019ve got to talk about something specific.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m just broke. I mean I\u2019m just totally broke. I\u2019ve been so good about this, but I totally forgot that I had when I paid my electric bill, I must\u2019ve I think I did it by phone. Actually, I know I did it by phone. And I think I, instead of just paying it, they\u2019re like when do you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">to pay I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I did, but I so I basically paid it I set the date for right around the due date instead of just paying it. It\u2019s these things aren\u2019t huge things, but they\u2019re huge things when you\u2019re broke. [00:01:01.23] When you\u2019re so that was taken out of my account. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">The rent was taken out of my account. I paid the credit card bill. I paid we have a practice space; I pay $60 a month. I decided to pay extra for that so the drummer wouldn\u2019t have to pay so much because he\u2019s 25 and broke, whatever. I mean not just me, the rest of us all decided to pay for him. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">I mean I didn\u2019t get a chance to check today. I had $30 yesterday when I checked. I hope it\u2019s not negative now. I don\u2019t know. But so my dilemma is this, is that whole thing I had about I don\u2019t feel like going to this wedding, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s making my mind up for me. I mean the wedding\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">in it\u2019s not like Stu\u2019s wedding where I can just drive to a place. That\u2019s $5 gas, you know what I mean? And that\u2019s it. So I don\u2019t know what to do now because I think it\u2019s just really going to be a bummer. [00:02:02.13] I had to miss this guy\u2019s bachelor party anyway, and he really wanted me to be there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">These are good friends of mine. It just it\u2019s awful. I feel like I\u2019m so tired of this shit. And you know what was funny? It was almost like a premonition yesterday. I when I don\u2019t know why, but when I left here, not right when I left here, but at some point I started thinking about all that money <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">my mom had gotten in that settlement years ago. Just I don\u2019t try not to go there because she goes there all the time, so I don\u2019t what\u2019s done is done. But really man, unreal. If that was right now, my both of our lives would be completely different, completely different. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Why, what happened to the money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It was squandered in a non-fun way. I mean she paid down the mortgage to our house, a lot. We still have like $200,000 of a mortgage but still, she paid it down, and we have tons of equity now, whatever. [00:03:04.28] Fine. But really what should\u2019ve happened is one of two things. You buy another <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">property or you put that money somewhere and you forget about it, which is what I that was the one thing I did try to get her to do. When it got down to like she had like $100,000 left or $150,000 or something like that, I took her myself, I made an appointment at the savings company, we sat down <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">with like their executive, but these people came up so it\u2019s really just anger at her in some of this. Because I did my part. I wasn\u2019t asking to go on vacation or you know what I mean? It\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what the fuck she was thinking. But well no, I do. It\u2019s that paranoia. I don\u2019t know mutual; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">I don\u2019t know what these things are. The banks will take your money. I mean really, just un it\u2019s like mom, they\u2019re do you understand what they\u2019re talking it\u2019s the most conservative T-Bills. I mean it\u2019s like and now that\u2019s the minute she brings it up I\u2019m like do not even go there because for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">her and that\u2019s her problem. [00:04:08.13] I mean I tried. I tried. And she didn\u2019t turn to her brother because his family\u2019s so fucking weird. All she would\u2019ve had to do was be like Derek, I have this much money. He would\u2019ve immediately been like uhm, you need to buy another multi-family. Cash or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200215\">You know what I mean? Just anyway...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561736\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: But then you wouldn\u2019t have the money now. If it were in the equity you wouldn\u2019t have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: It wouldn\u2019t have mattered, Claire, because it\u2019s like the house was going along anyway, wasn\u2019t it? We weren\u2019t losing the house. It was fine. You know what I mean? The tenants you would\u2019ve had money. Even if we had to pay a little bit out of our pocket for the mortgage plus the tenant, we would\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">fucking done that. Plus another now you have two homes building I mean and who knows what that other home would be worth now. We\u2019re talking like $2000 Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: My point is only it doesn\u2019t necessarily give you cash flow unless you sell it. [00:05:05.04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s the thing. It does and it doesn\u2019t. I mean another if we did it the right way, yes, you\u2019re right. Initially it\u2019s not like it\u2019d be a boon of cash, but look where we\u2019d be even just five years down. I mean in other words, that money would be locked, and if need be then fine, sell <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">it. Right? Sell the house, put that in a CD. But the money would be locked somewhere. Yeah. But anyway, I don\u2019t know why that was on my mind. And then at night when I checked my account, it just was like you know what? I what am I doing? I don\u2019t so and I don\u2019t want to do anything rash. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">want to not go to this wedding if that means it\u2019s so rude and my friends are going to hate me. I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t know what to do. I seriously don\u2019t know what to do. The ferry itself is $20, whatever, right there. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like at the wedding. [00:06:04.15] I mean you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">need some cash on you. You\u2019re going to an island where you have to stay the night. Even if I crash at my friend\u2019s room, I mean I don\u2019t like that idea of just going I\u2019m not 20. Like going and not having the ability to, if need be I just I mean I don\u2019t know. I think today I might just text a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200294\">of my guys. I just don\u2019t know what to do. Like I love you guys, and I feel really I do. I feel like ashamed. It\u2019s emasculating. But I don\u2019t I think I just have to tell them that there\u2019s a chance I might not be there. Because I literally don\u2019t know what to do. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not where you want to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: No. I mean I\u2019ve never been this broke. [00:07:07.20] This has never happened. If it\u2019s happened, it\u2019s happened in spurts. Well I\u2019ll get my check. And my check\u2019s not $400. You know what I mean? Like I\u2019ll this is it\u2019s getting like I was really feeling very stressed yesterday. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">I\u2019ve got to amp up my applications to jobs. I don\u2019t know. I mean I don\u2019t know how else I can amp that up. You know what I mean? Maybe I\u2019ll talk to Matthew because they\u2019re he\u2019s that poor guy, they\u2019re treating him like shit now. [inaudible] poor guy is like totally ignoring him. Lila, the fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">bitch, totally ignoring him. Matthew\u2019s such a nice guy, even I I had a beer with him last Friday. [00:08:03.15] He even called Ben one more time. He\u2019s like I just called him. I was like hey man, can we just talk? Like I\u2019m just very confused. And hope you\u2019re doing well. Nothing. It\u2019s like dude. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">I think his time there, whether he wants to admit it or not so part of me\u2019s like dude, Matthew, let\u2019s just get together. You know all these [inaudible] tunes man. They follow you like Moses. Let\u2019s start like our own tutoring thing. I mean all we need is like if I had three students a day, five days <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">a week, at $60 a pop, are you kidding me? Three, six $180 times five, five wait, what? Five I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a lot. Whatever. That\u2019d be like $800 a week? Yeah. Something like that. So I might because I can\u2019t do it anymore. [00:09:01.19] They fucked me doubly with that. You know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D5\">Like I\u2019m I can\u2019t tap into that now. And now I\u2019m just any guy on craigslist. Do you know what I mean? Like there\u2019s and on top of that now with the way the economy is, oh, tutoring, $20. Tutoring, $15. You know what I mean? These douches at Harvard, or kids and it\u2019s like I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561736\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It was a good gig here, paid a lot of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Paid a lot of money for what it was. So I mean I know you\u2019re not I don\u2019t want you to tell me what to do, right, but what I mean what do you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard if it\u2019s a close friend. You know what I mean? Who is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Mark. Mark\u2019s the really nice guy. Remember when I was doing my kick starter? He kicked in like $160. I mean like really nice people. [00:10:00.03] But I literally don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like literally it\u2019s a matter of you know what I mean? I just I\u2019m I can\u2019t ask my mom for money to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">to a wedding. I can\u2019t. The woman sold gold so I could start a business, and I\u2019m I would need like $100 or you know what I mean? That I just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t bring myself to do that. But I\u2019m also embarrassed to say anything because of course the first thing they\u2019re not they\u2019re not going to sit <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">around in a mean way, but that\u2019s when someone\u2019s telling you it\u2019s that bad, that\u2019s bad. When geez, you can\u2019t put it on a credit card or you can\u2019t no, I can\u2019t. I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like what to do about this immediate situation and also the future, those are separate questions. [00:11:03.04] Is there something else that would be worth doing differently over the next month so that this doesn\u2019t happen again. Do you know what I mean? Which is very different than when you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, see but see, those are different because the second one you\u2019re saying is just part of the same motivation, right? I mean I\u2019ve been broke anyway, right? What\u2019s happening is these fucking weddings, you can\u2019t cry poverty when someone gets married. My friend was saying that last night. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">so right. It\u2019s like it\u2019s so fucking personal, and it\u2019s which it is. It\u2019s lovely. Of course it\u2019s lovely, but everyone\u2019s different. My friend Laney was just saying she spent $2000 as a bride she\u2019s like I literally...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561736\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, she\u2019s like I literally have no my credit cards are all done. Like I can\u2019t and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not in this wedding party. And I she has a job; I don\u2019t have a job. So and on top of that I\u2019m in the red in terms of I\u2019m basically investing in a business. You know what I mean? [00:12:03.10] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">Not much, but for me it\u2019s a big deal. So but that stuff\u2019s motivating. It\u2019s all part of the same like what the what\u2019s going to happen is apply to more jobs, get some chump shrimps [ph] to tutor, whatever. You know what I mean? Like drum fucking start drumming up business. Think more about ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">to really get people all that shit. It\u2019s more this kind of thing that hurts me more. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been staying away from you know what I mean? Where then it really highlights. It just makes you feel like shit. It highlights it also it\u2019s about our culture. You know what I mean? Yes, I\u2019m 99.9% <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D3\">sure my friends of course will be disappointed, but they\u2019re not like going to shun me or something like that. It with because I\u2019m going to be fucking honest and stuff. But there will be there is it\u2019s almost like a class thing kind of. Or it feels like that way to me. Maybe I\u2019m sensitive. Just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D4\">that idea of like wow, man, you can\u2019t even put it on a credit card. [00:13:04.02] You\u2019re really differentiating I mean that\u2019s real poverty there. That\u2019s not like oh, I\u2019ll just put it on my credit card. I have no money, but I\u2019ll just put it on my when you can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s more me than them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: It brings up a lot of feeling in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: And also I have a lot of pride. Like our friend Sven, who\u2019s my age, Bernard that bachelor party, Bernard was like dude, Sven\u2019s been freeloading since we\u2019ve known him. It\u2019s Sven. You know what I mean? Because he was trying to say like just come down and we\u2019ll figure it out. I was like Bernard, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">I was like dude, I just that\u2019s not me. I just I don\u2019t I love you guys, but I don\u2019t I\u2019ve never liked that. That\u2019s not my maybe if I was 25. Yeah, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. Because I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m almost positive, one of these guys is going to be like dude, just come down and I\u2019ll pay <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200452\">for your ferry. [00:14:03.20] And then you almost feel more douchey by refusing that. But there\u2019s something about that I just I can\u2019t do it. Maybe that\u2019s too extreme, but I don\u2019t know what to do. I literally do not know what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: How would you feel if you didn\u2019t go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: Really guilty. And I guess it\u2019s just emasculating. However, a) I literally don\u2019t know how I would go. But b) what\u2019s happened is now this almost cements the things we\u2019ve been talking about. Now I could go there and have a great time [inaudible] like a shit when I get back home. Monday is my account <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">going to be negative? You know what I mean? I\u2019m just not (pause) I don\u2019t know what to do. [00:15:04.16] Laney, last night she was I was trying to get a girl\u2019s opinion. She was like dude, she was like don\u2019t lie. I know you won\u2019t, but it\u2019s like just be honest. Just tell them exactly what\u2019s up. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">like I mean if they\u2019re good friends of yours of course they\u2019ll be disappointed. Of course they might even be upset or whatever. But they\u2019ve got to understand that she\u2019s like that\u2019ll they\u2019ll forget about it. It\u2019s not she\u2019s like because you can\u2019t you have to do what you need to do, and if they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200493\">your good friends, they would know that only something serious would keep you from...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561736\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: You can also communicate that you want to be there. This is not what you wanted to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Of course. Of course. Well that\u2019s what I said with the bachelor party. I was like I feel embarrassed and shitty and like I miss you guys and I\u2019m just in a really this is where I am in my life right now. It\u2019s a transitional time and I\u2019m like I\u2019m very seriously like it\u2019s not like a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">hiccup where I\u2019m out of work but I\u2019ve got a big savings or I\u2019ve got a bunch of credit cards that I can just that\u2019s not the case. [00:16:13.19] I\u2019m really, literally...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And if they\u2019re disappointed or even upset it\u2019s because they want to see you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think and then what I could do is I could even like let\u2019s say they were getting married in San Diego, right. Expensive city, but I can just drive. I can get to San Diego for the gas money and then like they have an apartment there. They I could drive back the same if I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">to. I did it for shows. I\u2019d sober up and just drive back. Or whatever. I don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s something about a ferry to an island where you\u2019re stuck, and when you I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s almost claustrophobic to me. [00:17:05.09] Like I need to feel like I could have some purchase power if I had to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">do something. You know what I mean? I don\u2019t know. Maybe not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: The $20 is what a foot passenger is, to and from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Foot passenger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: Like in other words, instead of or do you mean in a car?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: You have to go oh, that\u2019s the other thing. You have to pay like $20 or $40 to park. Then it\u2019s like I think it\u2019s like $19 back and forth. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: $40.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: On foot in other words. It\u2019s not right? It\u2019s not you don\u2019t drive your car on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not going to take my car over. No, no, no. But I have to pay to park my car before getting on the ferry. And then again, I just don\u2019t know. I mean I shouldn\u2019t talk big. Even if it was San Diego, maybe I still couldn\u2019t go. I don\u2019t know. Because you go and, I don\u2019t know, what if the bar isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200611\">an open bar or what I don\u2019t I mean I just there\u2019s something about not you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. [00:18:07.27] You know what I mean? Like I just don\u2019t I that\u2019s like the ultimate humiliation. You\u2019re there and then somehow you need a little bit of cash and you don\u2019t have it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200612\">I don\u2019t know. I think other people could be like whatever, man, it\u2019ll just be whatever. It\u2019s not whatever. That stuff really affects me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: I imagine you could get a ride down there from someone or take the train down if you had to. Do you have to come up with $40 to get there and back? You could take the ferry back that night. Attend the wedding, leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561736\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: No, not really because I think the last ferry\u2019s like at eight or something, eight or nine. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s not a ferry like at one in the morning or something. And I mean if I\u2019m going to go through all that there\u2019s no way I\u2019m not going to drink. [00:19:02.04] These are like really, really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">close friends, and they\u2019re all drinkers and stuff. It\u2019s not like Stu\u2019s wedding where I really didn\u2019t know anybody, and I definitely had to drive, so I had like three beers right at the reception and then water all through dinner and dessert and coffee and all that. I mean I think that\u2019s what I might <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200652\">tell them, is that like there\u2019s a chance I might I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I\u2019m really going to try. I have to come because I was supposed to go down like today. Because that\u2019s the other thing. Most of them are there. There\u2019s no ride. They\u2019re all there already. So yeah, I guess I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: Your worry is their judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: Well, I mean there are a few things going on here. I mean I\u2019m there is also something in me that\u2019s like dude, I just don\u2019t want to because of all these see, this is what I\u2019m talking about. [00:20:04.04] I this is not where I am right now in my head. And that does suck because it\u2019s a special <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">day for my good friend. So is it it\u2019s kind of selfish of me, but at the same time it\u2019s not like I just don\u2019t feel like it. It\u2019s not like oh, I\u2019ve got a headache. I just or oh God, I\u2019ve got to drive all the way. This I\u2019m going through some serious shit here. It\u2019s not like a when have I ever done <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200692\">the only other time I\u2019ve done this is years ago when I was at Harvard, and that was also sudden. I mean I was having a nervous breakdown. I did not feel like going all the way to San Diego for a wedding. I just couldn\u2019t you know what I was like back then, a million times worse than I am now. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200693\">some of it is something in me just feels either protective or just feels like dude, this is not where this isn\u2019t you right now to do this thing. And it\u2019s not like you just don\u2019t feel like it. [00:21:02.20] It\u2019s that I feel very, very maybe it\u2019s overly focused on like okay, what am I doing. How do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200694\">I get business. How do I find a job. How do I get a fucking home equity line when I have a shitload of equity in this house. Like I\u2019m constantly this is a major stressful, difficult time for me. And it so that would be one thing. Then when like you don\u2019t have two nickels to rub together to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200695\">go to a wedding, then it\u2019s like something in me just snaps and it\u2019s like you know what? I don\u2019t I just can\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t have your fucking wedding on an island. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Or have it, but just understand that maybe some people just can\u2019t do that when they\u2019re going through a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200696\">hard time. Whatever. It\u2019s not so you know what I\u2019m saying? [00:22:01.11] It\u2019s some of it\u2019s that, too. Yeah, I\u2019m sure I could ask Raffi for $50 to go to a wedding. I just can\u2019t do it anymore. I can\u2019t do that. That guy helped me with my car. Because I can\u2019t lie. You know what I mean? I need to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200697\">to this wedding. I need wow, that\u2019s I\u2019m not 20. Especially because a lot of my Assyrian friends, they\u2019re like me. They\u2019re like then just who the fuck cares. Don\u2019t go to the wedding. Just be honest, tell them what\u2019s going on. And if they\u2019re friends of yours...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561736\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not the end of the world either way, in other words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just you know how I am. Like I just it\u2019s very symbolic to me. It\u2019s very symbolic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s also symbolic of your prioritizing things in a healthy way, too. You see it as only symbolic that this is how bad things are, but actually in the past you might have scrambled somehow or borrowed or spent money you didn\u2019t have. [00:23:05.12] I mean for you to also be saying I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">know if I can do this. I mean that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Right. And then I would\u2019ve gone and it would\u2019ve been fine, but then I\u2019d be right back...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: And actually worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: Worse, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: Then more in the hole and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: And also being upset with myself because I did it, kind of protect myself I just went along with whatever I thought I was yeah, yeah. No, I feel that. I just I think I just genuinely hate that things like this have to happen. I mean one thing I was thinking I mean I could they\u2019re getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200791\">married. I\u2019ll just I could always go to San Diego, spend time with them, which would be a more intimate thing anyway, take them out to dinner. You know what I mean? Like I could do stuff for them. (pause) I don\u2019t know. [00:24:16.22] I\u2019ve got to really drum up business. I\u2019ve got to start somehow. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200792\">don\u2019t I think I just have to just start telling people free consultation, 30 minute consultation. Last night I went on this date. I had a really nice date last night with this architect chick. She was really cool. But again, like I mean she was joking. She\u2019s like I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s like I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200793\">I\u2019m asking to be coached or like I\u2019m using your services. But like I\u2019m good at this shit. Like we were just her job, she\u2019s an architect, and this and that. [00:25:07.24] It\u2019s just and something intuitive. Not just intuitive, but I\u2019ve also done a lot of work and a lot of reading, and I think I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200794\">a good listener and all that. But I just kept thinking about all the friends, all the people that have told me that man, I need to see you. So I think what I need to do is be like come see me free for like 30 minutes. And at least then they can do a testimonial or they can whatever, just a way to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200795\">like I finally got on that fucking LinkedIn and all that shit. By the way, you\u2019re on there. I saw you. It was awesome. But just as a way to get people talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Are there ethics in coaching like that, [inaudible] friend. [00:26:10.28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: No. In life coaching? No. Life coaching almost encourages a more personal the same boundaries don\u2019t exist. Clearly, yeah, you don\u2019t want to be like don\u2019t sleep with them or whatever. But there is a more like a lot of coaches will be like let\u2019s say we have a session, right. Then I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D1\">totally be like I want you to e-mail me Monday and let me know how far you\u2019ve gotten with what we talked they\u2019re a little more yeah. Because it\u2019s that idea that it\u2019s because it\u2019s not therapy; it\u2019s the whole kind of methodology of it. The thinking of it is that it\u2019s a partnership, that I\u2019m partnering <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D2\">with the client to get things done. [00:27:01.00] I don\u2019t really have answers like you have answers. And I\u2019m just there to like help you tease those out and delineate and define and question. And then have come up with a my job is to kind of strategize help to strategize and then make sure you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D3\">follow through. It\u2019s pretty good. So yeah, no, there\u2019s no I can\u2019t ask them to be like hey, Claire says Brian\u2019s pretty if you don\u2019t want to use your name or whatever, I can\u2019t that\u2019s different. But I don\u2019t know. (pause) It\u2019s so funny because I\u2019m not depressed about any of this. That\u2019s the funny <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D4\">thing. I just feel what anybody would feel, which is holy shit, I\u2019m broke. I don\u2019t need to be broke. [00:28:07.14] This doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Everything\u2019s coming together to make it the exact opposite of what it is right now. I just need a couple of a little time, basically, to just keep doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D5\">what I\u2019m doing. I think I\u2019m doing things right. I mean I keep looking at these coaching books, and I get to chapters where I\u2019m like oh yeah, I\u2019m doing that. Like there was one, there was a really specific thing, oh fuck, what was it. It was something very specific about how you should do something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D6\">like a lot of people do it like this, but this is really it\u2019s like yeah, yeah, that seemed like common sense to me. That is how I do it. So there\u2019s a lot of things I look at these books. I\u2019m like I\u2019m glad they\u2019re there. They do have some very useful things in them. But it almost proves that I definitely <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D7\">should be just doing a Master\u2019s and not a certificate thing. [00:29:06.25] I think these are a lot of people who they\u2019re bright, but I\u2019m brighter, a little bit. I have a lot of flaws but I\u2019m on top of this shit. So I think I just need to do the real thing and (pause) but yeah, the whole like home <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D8\">equity thing. See these are the things it\u2019s hard for me to not to just take a break and not like this has got to get done. It\u2019s got to get done. How long would that take an application. Literally I think like a week or something. And everything would be different. Everything. Debts would be paid. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D9\">I wouldn\u2019t have to I mean it\u2019s almost like absurd. It is absurd in a way. I can\u2019t go to a wedding. What? Or I can\u2019t pay this woman a couple of hundred dollars that I owe her, when we have a it\u2019s maddening. [00:30:06.03] So I don\u2019t the thing is, it\u2019s getting I can\u2019t ask Raffi because they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D10\">going through hell right now. It is asking obviously it is a big deal to ask someone. It\u2019s not a little thing. So that\u2019s who do you approach. And you don\u2019t want to make people feel bad or feel like, I don\u2019t know, obligated or whatever. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561736\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: The home equity line you think you could open in a week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: I mean whatever.

At the most they might appraise it. Fine, okay. And I don\u2019t want like $200,000, whatever. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200811\">right now I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: You probably could get it in a week.

To be safe I\u2019d be like give me $30,000, $50,000, whatever. It\u2019s a line. It\u2019s not going to be used. So that if there\u2019s like what happened with my uncle, right? He had to help us fix the roof. That didn\u2019t have to happen. We would\u2019ve just paid for that shit. Then every month you pay it <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">with your mortgage. I mean we\u2019re doing it anyway. So or here, or these fucking credit cards. You just clear all this my friend who these friends who helped me with my car, like they wouldn\u2019t have had to do that, or if anything else or if nothing else at least I immediately pay them back. My <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200892\">poor friend with the divorce, the guy gave me $2,000. He\u2019s going through hell. It drives me crazy that I can\u2019t just give this guy his money back.

He\u2019s helped my uncle\u2019s been there for us. You know what I mean? Like I can\u2019t he just bought this fucking house. He\u2019s and he\u2019s like a broken man basically. Fucking diabetes and shit. He\u2019s already frustrated with having to employ <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A11\">my cousin. I don\u2019t want to bother him. You know what I mean? I feel like I have enough of a circle I just have to I asked one person. So we\u2019re going to try to get together and he was like well, that sounds like more of an in-person conversation. [00:33:12.11] I was like absolutely man. It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A12\">I don\u2019t want you to feel I was like you\u2019re one of the few, few, few people I would turn to. But it\u2019s got to happen. Like it absolutely has to happen. Because this conversation wouldn\u2019t be happening. It\u2019s debt, but it\u2019s debt in your house that\u2019s getting paid every month anyway. One way or the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A13\">that mortgage is going to get paid. It\u2019s a centralized you know what I mean? And you only take it when you need it. It\u2019s not just some willy nilly (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">THERAPIST: The other way this situation would happen is if you had a part time job. [00:34:03.13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s I mean all these things have to happen in tandem. I think the equity line just has to happen anyway. Because as home owners you just need that. My mom\u2019s retired. What if I go home right now and the oil the heater, hot water heater, you know what I mean? Well that\u2019s like $800. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A51\">We\u2019ve got to call my uncle. Fuck that, man. It\u2019s ridiculous. So then yeah, and some kind of part time job. Absolutely. But these things are they feed each other. If there\u2019s a home equity line, guess what? Suddenly that nonprofit I want to do, I can do. Like you can do things more right. Do you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A52\">what I\u2019m saying? Yeah, I could do the nonprofit right now, but you do have to pay the fee to set it up. Like right now I can\u2019t make my thing into LLC, right. They\u2019re protection things. I don\u2019t have enough money for insurance right now. I mean there is you need the money to make money, on some level. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200A53\">[00:35:05.07] I mean it\u2019s a fucking other people spend $2$3$400,000 getting a business off the ground. These are really minor investments, you know what I mean?
