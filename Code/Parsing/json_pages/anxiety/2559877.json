Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: How are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I'm okay. How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Good. (PAUSE) I had this cool woman experience. (PAUSE) It made me all happy about being a woman. I like those experiences. It happens a lot in eastern cultures and, in a way, different than the way it happens in the west.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I got my eyebrows threaded which is what they do if you have to remove hair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What does it involve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It involves a piece of thread... That's the main thing. Like some thread and (PAUSE) you basically like sort of cross it over itself. (PAUSE) You... So there's like your two hands and your mouth and you somehow like get a long piece of thread, hold one piece in your mouth, hold, like, loop one <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">piece around your, one of your fingers and like your other hand is the moving hand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: And what forms in the middle, what you form in the middle after repeated like crossing over is this tiny little (PAUSE) basically like hole or loop that you can use to grab individual hairs and pull them out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: So it's similar to like tweezing. But you can also cut hairs with the thread. It's very sharp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Is it kind of like a fishing line kind of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: No. It's just sewing thread but it.. (PAUSE) If you get like a single piece of hair in a thread loop and you just like pull the loop tight, it will cut the hair. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So the result is that you will have extreme precision over... And you just.. It's sort of this fluid motion where you just sweep over the area and the result is like a lot more shape and control compared to like waxing for example where you just sort of like slop the wax on there and you get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">what you get off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: So then there are these women who do it. It's like... It's this thing where you go in and there's all these people sitting around and they're working there. And there's always like some kind of soap opera or movie playing. It's a tanning salon too so there's an interesting cross section of people. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\"> So today, there were... There was a woman already in there. I think she was like half and half something else, maybe black. And she was like not enjoying it. It was her first time. And she was like, \"Oh...\" And she was like moaning and asking her to stop saying, \"Why do you women do this?\" And so the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">women were like giggling, giggling, giggling. I'm giggling. And I'm sort of... She's like, \"How are you still sitting there?\" She's like touching my arm. I've been doing this for like fourteen years of something. So I was like, \"Yeah. It hurts. But you get used to it and it's worth it. It's better than... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F3\">It's better than anything else.\" And she was like, \"Oh no. Oh no.\" She started like making this huge scene.  And then, when the lady gets to my upper lip, like this part, there's some like involuntary tearing that sort of happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Which is totally so painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So I start like straining tears and this woman is like, \"Oh. You're crying. I cried for that part too.\" The other woman was like, \"What? What?\" Like, \"Yeah. I cried for that too.\" So there's like tissues and this other woman is like not comforted and it's just this really nice arch. And then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">they're so proud of their work. They show you in the mirror and then you get a massage. You get an eyebrow massage. It is the best thing ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559877\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Wow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: You should try it sometime. It's like a little bit of oil or lotion. And that's like also a very important part of this (PAUSE) mind, body, blood flow, skin restoration, like, experience. (PAUSE) And then like I didn't have cash and I didn't have my credit card. And then it's like, \"Oh, okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">Pay us next time.\" (PAUSE) It was like... Experiences like that don't happen a lot in this country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Oh they do? You mean... (PAUSE) When you say \"experiences like that\" you mean the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: The whole thing, yeah. (PAUSE) Did you get migraines as a kid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: No. I don't think so<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: There was (inaudible at 00:07:19) has been through all this tough stuff. He's eleven. He went through this discovery of his OCD and exploration of the sort of therapy based treatment for a while. Things are good. Now he's scared of developing terrible migraines like ten and two weeks. He has <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">then twice a month for the last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Oh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: So I had a nice moment with Felicity (ph) where she told me about... She was telling me about this and she told me about this headache clinic down at the hospital and it's like the most collection of services I've ever heard of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: It's experimental. There's neurology. There is... There are behavioral psychologists, like child psychologists. There are also like various CVT... I don't know. I don't know all the different gradations. But there are a lot of therapy people. There's acupuncture. There's biofeedback. There's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">reiki (ph), massage, and then there's like all these... There's like a coordinator who helps you through all the... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So Jaden (ph), who's eleven years old has got to pick the things that resonated with him. And the neurologist handed him pills and he's like, \"No. I can't take pills.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: He chose to do biofeedback and acupuncture. (PAUSE) Which is so cool. Have you don't biofeedback? I think it's really legit. (PAUSE) And then I've just... I've been imagining what it would be like to grow up to like be eleven and be equipped with these tools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I think it would... I think it's going to be life changing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: And to think that he could have chosen medication (inaudible at 00:10:19) But that's such a different... That gives you such a different relationship with your pain (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Most people... I wonder if most people think that being in therapy requires you to be active. Because it feels to me like there's such (PAUSE) like I'm constantly trying to be more active which is not a very passive thing to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) (inaudible at 00:13:19) (PAUSE) I guess I'm not trying (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: And also I think working on the feelings that like sometimes can tell you to be active. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) That's comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:14:23)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: I think I need to be more clear about what it means to be active. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559877\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Well it seems to me that the way that it's often come up between us which is (PAUSE) sort of... (PAUSE) Well... (PAUSE) Is, I think, a lot to do with you actively doing stuff to me and like with how you use sort of the space with asking me questions or like trying to get to know me in some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">ways... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Which I think is for a lot of reasons but I think among them is you worry if you don't do those things, I think that I like... You won't be there for me in the same way (inaudible at 00:16:27) (PAUSE) You won't be in the same place for me or that I won't see you in the same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Or that you won't... Yeah. Go ahead. (PAUSE) Or you won't know how to make sure that doesn't happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: That it won't happen that you will stop seeing me in the same way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, that's hard because I don't... (PAUSE) I think I know how you see me in important ways. I don't think I know how you see me in my own way. So like why I'm trying to affect the less important ways. I think I am (inaudible at 00:17:53) I think it's hard to change the way (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Like some of it is habit. Some if it is quite conditioned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you feel as though I'm telling you you should be different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: This is always where we end up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: This exact exchange. Like I'm making it sound like I feel like you want me to change it. (PAUSE) I think that is how I, that is what it sounds like. I mean, I don't actually think that you want me to be in any way other than the way I am. I think that's... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: That's serious. That's what I get from you. That's important. But I do think somehow like... There's like this, a shared value that's developing around recognizing performance and maybe not, maybe recognizing how it is without as much performance or active manipulation or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: It makes me anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah. For me, the central point is the anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">(CROSSTALK)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Excitement can be good. There can be good kinds of arousal. You've already got one of them really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: I think the line is blurred for me. (PAUSE) Like if I think that... Actually I remember (PAUSE) there are people in my life who...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: It's so hard to explain. Who I think of differently and sort of love differently and love a little more because they remind me of you, in some ways. So Brian (ph) the farmer is one of them because the farm is like at your house. That's hard for me because I am walking there more. So that's like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">superficial. But it's like there. I feel it. I kind of want it to be my own thing. I kind of want to share it with you too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Share in terms of talking about it with me or share in terms of... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: In like a magical thinking kind of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Like together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I'm closer to you or like you might go there someday. (PAUSE) And that's so powerful. It's surprisingly scary how powerful that is. I think also being on a farm is powerful. We were talking about a... I don't know. (PAUSE) Like the (ph) grocery store... I feel like I wouldn't... That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">not a very evocative place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: The farm is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. The farm is... All you do is sit and weed tomatoes or pull hundreds of bulbs of garlic. What am I going to think about? (LAUGHTER) And it's long and hot and it's painful but it's also beautiful and that's how this is. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559877\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: That sounds sensual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: It's very sensual.

And boobs are important because (PAUSE) because of bras which are like horrible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">CLIENT: I like stop... Sometimes I'll just stop wearing a bra for a while. It's happened in various times of my life. Last year it happened from January to maybe the beginning of the summer just because I had come from that difficult juncture with Kelly (ph) and I was writing that dissertation proposal. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201B31\">And somehow, wearing a bra just felt so awful, like insult to injury. So I just stopped. I didn't wear a bra for like five months and it felt so good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: I'm lucky that I can like do it comfortably. (PAUSE) Many women can't. And then, since then, I have only worn... Do you know the company (ph)? (PAUSE) It's a wool... It's like an organic wool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I do. I was thinking it was a bra manufacturer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: It's sort of outdoorsy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: They're based in Maine. I'm not very brand focused but when there are good products that come from Maine, I try to support it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">CLIENT: The whole family... This is one where you can wear it for seven days in a row and it won't smell and it's very comfortable and soft and it's very expensive. But over the years, I've accumulated enough bottoms that I don't wear anything else. And these are like fifty dollars a pair. It feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF1\">so ridiculous. But it's very comfortable and they are nice colors. So at the end of my no bra time last year when it was becoming hard to be respectable in lab, I found out that they makes bras that are essentially like glorified sports bras. But they're mostly wool and they don't... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">THERAPIST: They're somehow not itchy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">CLIENT: They're not itchy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) So since then, I've only been wearing those bras. They're not particularly concealing. I have quite nipply boobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER) Did you surprise yourself with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) You nodded and you said, \"Mm hmm.\" I just stopped to think about that for a second.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">THERAPIST: I know that was the object of what you said. But what did you think of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">CLIENT: I just wondered if you had noticed and that's what you had nodded about. Like, \"Yeah, uh huh. I know that you have a nipple visibility situation.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">CLIENT: So boobs are... Boobs and bras go together okay when they're comfortable. But not as good as no bra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">CLIENT: Sometimes I summon or invite you to sex. (PAUSE) Like kind of a way of doing (inaudible at 01:04:31) And it confuses me when I do it because sometimes when I don't invite you and you still appear, it's so frustrating and horrible (PAUSE) and invasive. (PAUSE) But then other times, I want you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">CLIENT: It feels so strongly like what we should be doing. (PAUSE) And it feels so natural to just sort of just pretend that Jeremy's penis is your penis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E1\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E3\">THERAPIST: What do you think we do that makes it feel so erotic here sometimes?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559877\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: Look at each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: And play (ph). (PAUSE) I mean, I think it's... Some of it is self-described also as you show somebody unconditional kindness and acceptance and it's very different from any kind of relationship. So maybe for some people, that it more reminiscent of a parent or... I don't know. For me, it's some <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E91\">combination of a lover and (PAUSE) a friend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">CLIENT: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 01:08:37)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">CLIENT: And we...

(PAUSE) Do you want to talk about the sort of thoughts and images and fantasies that you have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">CLIENT: I don't know.

(PAUSE) And you were touching me while Jeremy was touching. These fantasies aren't... They're so entangled with what happens between me and Jeremy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">CLIENT: But, yeah, I can recall your face and can imagine like what you would sound like and I'm aroused. If you would sound like anything. I'm sure about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20209\">THERAPIST: How would you describe that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020B\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">CLIENT: Soft and (PAUSE) also like kind of involuntary and (PAUSE) like sort of the way that I... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20213\">CLIENT: I mean... (PAUSE) That I make a sound because it feels so good because I can't not make a sound. Sort of like that sound. I guess it's hard to describe. Sort of like a humming, moaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20215\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. Like spontaneous.

(PAUSE) Like I had gotten just a little taste and I hoped to get more of how it's just about not knowing what the unconscious connections are. But they're there.

It's about what happens between us (inaudible at 01:18:35) (PAUSE) Yeah. Those are... That's sort of like the...
