data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Can I let you know about Friday, if I can come in tomorrow, or is that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what are your thoughts? My schedule is very, very tight, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, what are your thoughts about Friday? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I was just wondering. I have a paper due on Friday and a project, and I just, I'm struggling with both of them. So I just wondered if instead of coming here, I could just work on that. But hopefully I can help my progress today and tomorrow, so. You said 11:00 for Friday, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I have you in for 10:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Ten, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I could double-check, but I think it's for 10:00, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Okay. So is it okay if I let you know tomorrow, or no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: No, you did I need to know today. I would definitely need to know today, because yeah, because my schedule is so tight, and I have people waiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So if you don't need that. I mean, I'd like to see you and we could talk about it, but if you don't need that time, I'd really appreciate not last minute notice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Okay. I guess I could come in. I just, this week, I guess I feel like I want to focus more on work for just a couple days because that's all I have because therapy kind of does in a way make me very self-conscious. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I am conscious about everything. Like I interact with people, so I get, I guess, I'm conscious about my interaction, so. But hopefully I won't interact with that many people. (chuckle) I always say that, and then I seek out company. So (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: And do you feel like your interactions in general make you less able to work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: No, I just seek them out instead of sitting and working, but then, yeah. So I don't know. Yeah, I guess, I mean I do set targets, but then I don't know how realistic they are, and then when I cannot meet them and I feel like, oh, no, you know. What am I doing? And then I just have to get over <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">feeling bad, and then make new targets. (laughter) So, I don't know. I've never done this before so I really don't know how it's done, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">(pause) It's new for every person, which is weird, you know. The human experience. (chuckle) Like, you're supposed to have your own original feelings about everything, and that. And last night, or I think it was this morning, I was having a dream. It was weird. It wasn't weird, just a mild event. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">what was it? I can't remember all of it now, but I think we were all at a reading or something, or maybe it was a workshop, but Victor (sp) was there, and he was reading, and the understanding was that he's so much better, or he is just as good at writing, and then I woke up, and it's like, huh. He's <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">beating me at my own game, or you know. Like it only took him a few hours to focus, and then produce something really good. (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">So I was wondering why I have that that I think that way. Maybe everyone thinks that way, like they feel like, you know, other people will surpass them, but they already know someone else's success directly means your failure, you know. I wonder why I have that kind of equation. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">I mean, I just wonder if it's peculiar to me, or if everyone feels that way, and they're just going to gloss over it, or if I feel that way more than usual. I think it's kind of related to my sense of deprivation or something. I only have very little bit so how can you take it? How can you have it too, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">or this is mine. I don't know. Maybe I think that I have it in abundance, you know, like it won't run out. (chuckle) Then I'll be generous to myself and everyone, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What made you think about asking my permission?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: For what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: To not come on Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: No, I just, I wanted to know if you had some sort of a notice I should give you. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: And, you know, if, you know, by tomorrow it would be too late, and it's too late. (chuckle) That's all. I mean, I could've just said less truthfully, \"Oh, I cannot come on Friday,\" sorry. But I don't know if you would've gotten upset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: And what would I be upset about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Well, cancelling. Don't people get upset when people cancel on them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Do you feel upset when people cancel on you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: You know? (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Sorry, I don't -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: You take it very personally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was I have this e-mail from nine years ago, when Chris and I first started talking, and a couple days before the day before my birthday party, he said, \"I cannot come. Sorry.\" And I was like, you know what, I made all this vegetarian food for you, and this and that, and I've never <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">celebrated my birthday. But my birthday's were full of mom trying to get me a cake or something, and my dad finding an excuse to ruin the whole day, and this and that, and it hurts you're not coming. (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">So I was just wondering what made me think that way, like immediately. Disappointment or rejections immediately made me run to my past, or if not just the past, then just have this narrative of deprivation, like I haven't had this. Like, I couldn't think that I may have lots of birthday parties in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">future, you know. And every year well, not every year, well, most several years I've celebrated Chris's birthday. His and my birthday are seven days apart, so I always put on a big show for him, invite all his friends, and plan days in advance. Oh, god. I don't have anything. I have to do something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B2\">for his birthday. Oh, shit. It's a few days away. But, yeah, so you know, I'll send an e-mail today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">But, yeah, so what was I saying? Yeah. I always do a big thing for him and when he's like, \"No, it's your birthday, too. You can cut the cake with me,\" this and that, and all of a sudden I get very coy, or something. I'm like a martyr in the room, like no, I don't deserve it. I don't like to celebrate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">my birthday, this and that. And, yeah. So I, kind of, hide away and let people celebrate his birthday. But I don't know why I do that. I don't know why I put on this almost like a martyr, like oh, yeah, you know, it's all for him. You know, I'm not going to take anything, and I don't want anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D2\">(laughter) I don't know why I do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">Now I'm thinking, well, wait, I like to have fun, you know. I like to laugh at people, you know. I'd like it if they came to my party, but maybe I'm just so scared that they won't come that I just make it all for him. You know, it's all his. If people don't come, it's because they don't like him, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">you know, but mostly they all come. Sorry, did I interrupt you? You were saying something about I take it personally.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know why, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: So when asking about cancelling, it's like you're saying I'm doing something to you, and I'm worried about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle) Which is why, I guess even if I had stuff to do, and I said to someone I'll be there, and do this, I have a hard time cancelling. Like yesterday, I really just wanted to go home and work, but I went and visited these people because I had said I would. And I had cancelled or postponed <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">once I felt, you know, can't keep doing it. (chuckle) Because I take things personally, so I assume others do, too, you know. And if they don't, then that bothers me, too. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's like, how can you remove yourself from things? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What are they removing themselves from? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Well, I just said they weren't invested in it as much in the first place. I don't do it all the time, just sometimes or most of the (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Then it sounds like you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't. If you care, then, you know, you're sort of imposing upon you an expectation that you can't fulfill, like coming in. And if they don't care, well, it's like, \"How can you not care?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle) Yeah, I don't know if there is a way out. (chuckle) I just want people to care. (chuckle) Like, I understand people can't be caring every single minute. They would go crazy. I am right? No? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: So am I supposed to feel, oh, you can't come? Awesome. I wanted that time free anyway. Or should I feel, I can't believe she's not coming. Doesn't she take me seriously?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Well, I was afraid you'd feel the latter. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: But not the former?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I have no opinion on that. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I have no opinion on that. I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: You don't have an opinion?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I didn't hear what you said. You said you have no opinion on that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I'm just scared of disappointment, and so I am scared of disappointing other people. Especially people I have known for a while, right, so <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Well, there's this other piece of obligation and feeling obligated, and sometimes feeling angry at feeling obligated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Feeling like that's inhibiting your freedom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know why I think that way. Yeah, like yesterday when I was waiting at the station, these people, I'm like, what the hell am I waiting? Like, I could be doing X, Y, and Z right now, and well, or maybe working on my paper. I'll be back and getting ready and this and that. They're <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">just going to feed me all your food, and I'm going to get fatter, and say ahh. (chuckle) Yeah, I felt inhibited, yeah. (pause) So is it possible to have interactions in which you care, but not feel obligated, and like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: I mean, obligations are part of life, for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: But like so what's I'm creating an obligation.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: No, I didn't necessarily say you're creating an obligation. You have feelings about feeling obligated. You don't like it, and a lot of times, you want to push back against it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: You tend to fee imprisoned by your obligations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Most people don't? Or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Imprisoned? No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Why do I feel imprisoned? I don't know. (pause) You don't feel imprisoned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Do you think that's a general human experience to feel imprisoned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I mean, I'm wondering if that's you feel most people just feel imprisoned during their lives, I mean, throughout their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Probably not. (chuckle) Is it because they know and see that they have other options, or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I guess that's a part of it. (pause) And I guess also you think about that obligation is not the same thing as sacrifice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: What do you mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well, if you feel part of the way of feeling imprisoned is that your obligations involve self-sacrifice versus these are your obligations, and sometimes you may not even always want to do them. They're not necessarily self-sacrifice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: So I equate them as self-sacrifice, or they're actually -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I think you feel like you're sacrificing a lot for your obligations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Hm. So like yesterday, I could've just said, oh, I have a final paper due, guys. I cannot meet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: That's actually not what I meant, but I guess you could do that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Well, what did you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: That you'd go, but you wouldn't feel like it was sacrificing something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And that you're aware of doing something is taking away from something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I went and I said I won't stay very long, and then hopefully I can work when I get back home, which I did for a little bit. I mean, it could've been longer if I was living by myself. (chuckle) But I guess in bigger scenarios, like my mom, like by giving her money and by helping her out <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">in whatever ways, I don't necessarily have to feel that I'm sacrificing a lot. Or I can get, yeah. I don't know. Is that? Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I'm confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It seems like you came in here feeling like you were going to tell me something that was going to somehow hurt me or upset me like because how you started the session before you got here in terms of your own, sort of, thinking and feeling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I acted like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: No, that you were feeling that way. You were going to say something to me that you imagined would upset me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Oh. No, it's that thing about playing hooky on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: And that sounds like a little girl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: No, I just mean, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Playing hooky is a Sunday night kid does to get away out of something that he or she should be doing, and skirting authority.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It's not in the framework of an adult woman who is asking for session in therapy so she can make a better life for herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I am also aware since it was something that came from me, even though you brought it up again, that I don't want the third session to become about something that's for me and not for you. It's a recommendation I had, and it's something that you can feel free to go along with or not. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD1\">we're doing very productive work twice a week. I don't think like, oh, my gosh, this isn't going well. We need to do something different. But it's important that it feels like it's for you, and that's something that you want, and not something that you're doing for me, and that maybe you can get out of sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: No, it doesn't feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I understand. I wanted to put that out there, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, no, it doesn't feel like that. I guess I phrased it that way because, you know, I don't know, I assumed, you know, that it mattered as much to you as to me. I don't know. (chuckle) So like you would personally feel bad if I didn't come in, that's all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, that I would?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Because I would see it as a rejection? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah, rejection of your work or something (laughter) of your recommendation. So but yeah, I know it's for me, you know, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I was thinking, but there's a difference between my saying, you know, what do you think about coming in three times a week, and you're saying, \"No, I'm not doing that,\" or, \"Yes, I'm doing that,\" but then as the day approaches, \"Oh, I don't think I can come.\" So because I feel like the latter's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">more you, like signing up for something you don't always necessarily want or feel like you might be doing it for the other person, not you, and then feeling annoyed by it and wanting to try to get out of it. You're not saying no early in the process. You sign up for it it looks like you're signing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED2\">up for it but then you pull out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I've done that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Why, does that make the other person feel cheated, or what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: I had never thought about that, but that's clearly on your mind about how the other person might feel and imagining they would feel cheated. It certainly sounds like an experience you've had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Feeling cheated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: You don't think that's something you felt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: By my dad, or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: I don't know. It feels like something as you said, it seems very true in terms of how you feel in a lot of ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Hm. But not by lovers so much as, like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: Life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Things in life, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: Like Victor with this woman in his passenger seat. It seemed like you felt cheated out of that seat or cheated out of rewards. You know, you feel that way, someone has gotten something that's really yours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't feel that way anymore. (chuckle) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: You don't feel it anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: About him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: About him? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Well, you know when I said I had never felt it was about Victor to begin with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah. That narrative about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: I always feel like well, you said you don't feel that way about him anymore, and I mean, I would imagine maybe in the future you might, but that it's about the narrative, not about who he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I'm confused. We're talking about many things at once it seems like. (laughter) That I am (pause) Yeah, I do sign up for things without just because I feel obligated and then I pull out. Like, how do I say no upfront? What would it be? So I should just come in and cross my <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B1\">leg and say, \"No, Doctor, I do not think I can see you on Friday (laughter) and have a third session until August when I have better control of my financial situation.\" (laughter) Isn't that the adult-like no, I'm not mocking, I'm actually being serious.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2011A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, when you come up with these scenarios, and then you ask me whether they're okay or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: You don't say, \"I have no idea what that would like.\" You say, \"I have an idea of what this would look like,\" and then you say, \"Is this okay?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: (chuckle) No, I'm, you know, imagining it out loud, so. (pause) Yeah, part of it is, you know, like having unreasonable, kind of, idea of things, like my time, and my work, and stuff. Like, oh, I can stay up and do it, so I should just sign up for this one thing because the other person is, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201231\">you know, insisting so much. But I've tried. I'm starting to say no to things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah, my first thought when you're saying that someone is insisting so much that you do it to get someone off your back. (crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: Well, don't we all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: Agree to things to get someone off our backs? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckle) I don't know. Like part of the reason I went to Ohio the other weekend was because I felt scared of disappointing that guy and getting him angry, which is weird because at the end, he did get very angry. Like a no-win situation. If I go, I'd probably would make him angry. If <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B1\">I don't go, I'd probably make him angry. But I didn't realize that I could make him less angry no, I don't think so. I think that guy is just weird, you know. He probably would've broken up with me, even if I didn't go. He probably would've just snapped and said, \"Oh, you're blah.\" (chuckle) But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B2\">guess we're not here to analyze him. And I felt very obligated to go. So I would do anything if people made me feel obligated, I'd probably, you know, sleep with them and whatever. (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: That's a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: Isn't it? Yeah, it's a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Well, do you think it's not a problem or you (crosstalk) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is, it is. Like being a doormat, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: But it's being an angry doormat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: I'm serious. Being a doormat is a problem in itself. I'm not saying that that would be good, but then the added thing is it's an angry doormat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: It's like, \"I'm laying here. How dare you step on me?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: Well, I have definite visual. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: What did you have? What was your visual?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: You know, like an angry door. You step on it and it bites your leg off. (laughter) And I have to hop inside. An angry doormat. I like that. I'll remember it. (laughter) No, this was really good because I feel bad when I think of myself as a doormat, but you've made a big improvement in the picture, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201431\">and, you know, I mean in real life, I'm actually an angry doormat. That gives me an agency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: A power. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: It is a power, but it's sort of a very -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Self destructive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and sort of subversive. It's not a power to say no, it's like you have to say yes, but then you'll get something after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So my goal is to go from being an angry doormat to what, a wall hanging?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: Hm, a wall hanging?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: Someone who's, sort of, an inanimate object, and it hangs out on the side. That's not participating in anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20154-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20154-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">CLIENT: No. I mean, it could be the center of attention that gets talked about for a few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">THERAPIST: It's not interactive, I guess. The wall hanging is not an interactive although, I guess if people are staring at you, then it's still not interactive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">CLIENT: But I thought we were still in the realm of inanimate objects, so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">THERAPIST: That's right. So then how would you create an inanimate object? How would you use an inanimate object, use that as a way of sort of thinking about a healthy relationship. I don't know. That's a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">CLIENT: I guess I could be a coffee table. That's interactive, right? No? (laughter) I'd get used. That's sort of the doormat. I'm confused. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: I mean, an angry doormat is, sort of, part of a victim's narrative. You don't have the power to say yes or no, but after the fact you can make someone feel guilty or bad about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I have to change that. The hardest one to change would be my mom, like my interaction with her. She definitely is entrenched in her like [doing stuff] (ph) and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm, uh-huh. She really is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: That's why I, sort of, I avoid the are we done or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: No, we still have and I was, sort of, a few minutes today, almost ten minutes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">CLIENT: Oh. I mean that's why I avoid her because it's like she can't go there with her feeling like a victim, so and it's hard for me to be on my guard and catch her all the time. It was funny was that on Mother's Day? Yeah, it was a few days before Mother's Day, just meeting. It was a day after <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B1\">I, kind of, not really screamed at her, but like, kind of, maybe a little rudely said, \"So what are you doing about a job?\" and this and that. The next day we met, and we're just walking around the square, and she saw a sign at a shop that said now hiring, and so she's like, \"Should I apply there?\" Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">THERAPIST: She said that with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And earlier, that would've, kind of, depressed me or maybe even really depressed me because I would've thought, oh, how bad for my mother. At every shop she goes to, she is going to look at that sign, and that she's going to take any menial job just so I could have my own place. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F1\">I could've fallen in that trap, but I didn't and, you know, maybe I don't know. And I thought, yeah, so what? So what if she I mean, this looks like a decent shop. You know, like she could work here, you know. Why should I automatically feel bad about or lowly about her working here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: You got a sense of she was wanting that to make you feel bad a little bit? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I didn't fall for it. Well, I did, kind of. I said, \"Don't worry. You don't have to jump at the first sign you see. It's okay. It's all right. You can finish your exams, pay the rent this month. And, you know, finish your exam and, you know, we'll see.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Like a mom. You did eat your dinner tonight, so you will get a little treat after. But tomorrow -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: (chuckle) What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: Well, \"Is it okay if I don't get a job? Oh, well, yeah, you get to have some chocolate because you ate.\" It's like a little kid talking to their parent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Hm. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2017A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">THERAPIST: It's not a woman with a an adult woman responsible narrative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">CLIENT: Wait. For me or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">THERAPIST: For her in that case. You know, is it okay if I well, actually for both of you. I mean, you're the parent saying, \"Oh, it's okay. I'll take care of you just another day.\" She's saying, \"Please, please, please will you take care of me one more day?\" I really think for you I can't say for <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201811\">her, I don't know what her growth potential is, but for you, it's such a destructive pattern. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">THERAPIST: This whole pattern between you and your mother about this, sort of, child. I mean, not destructive like it's going to cause you harm and you better get out of it immediately, but as an ongoing thing, I think it's so bad for you to, sort of, feel like in this role of her as a child and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201851\">as a parent, and you're scold her, and you're feeling guilty for scolding her, or maybe I've scolded her too much today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">CLIENT: Hm. Why is that destructive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">THERAPIST: For a lot of reasons. First of all, because you replicate not actively, but in all your relationships where you're sometimes the mom and sometimes the daughter, like with me, \"Is it okay if I don't come to school on Friday?\" And it doesn't allow you for a voice, and, sort of, the freedom <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201891\">to just interact with people outside of this dynamic. You do this with Victor, too. You know, with you're being the child. All of your energies are tied up in it. You've got other things to do with your life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">CLIENT: Do I? (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: I think you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like you'll have nothing left if you break free of this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: No. I would like to have a different narrative. More things, yeah. But I mean, can I not just have one separate, kind of, interaction with my mom, and separate with others?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: Are you saying is it practically possible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, whatever. You know, practically, emotionally. Can I not act like an adult in my other relations, and well, adult as in equal, and then with my mom, I get a little more mother-like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: Which is funny, because the way I think about it is with people with their parents, even if they are not like those other relationships, can be somewhat regressed with their parents. What's interesting is regress with your parents is some ways as being the opposite of regressed, because you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201991\">not regress means child-like, and there is something, a regressive pull with your mom, but you're the adult, at least a lot of the times, certainly. Kind of screwy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">Do I think that people can be regressed with their parents in a way that they're not with other relationships? That it's something unique to their parent that pulls that out, pulls that from them? Yes. But it's just sort of ubiquitous right now, and it's so strong. I mean, the issue is not whether your <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B1\">mother gets a job or not for you. The issue is whether you pay her rent or not. If you don't pay her rent, it's her decision whether she wants to get a job or not. I mean, these are not the same thing. You see them as the same thing. You guys are separate. Your issue is whether you can or can't, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B2\">want to or don't want to pay her rent. What she does about that, whether she gets a job or doesn't get a job, or whatever she does, they're separate. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2019A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559564\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I have a hard time seeing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: They're very separate. I mean, she could get a job and still not pay her rent. I mean, there's a lot, you know. I understand it's not a crazy connection you're making, but in terms of your own responsibility, it's different. Because then you're also saying you're giving her responsibility <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F1\">that's not hers. You're saying it's your responsibility to get a job or else I have to still pay your rent. No, you don't. That's your responsibility to decide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">CLIENT: Well, you know, the thing that makes me say that is I think it's her understanding is that I wanted this. I wanted us to live separately, therefore, I must pay for it. You know? So it's not her rent, you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">THERAPIST: It is. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">CLIENT: That thing is my desire to not live with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">THERAPIST: So you have to pay for that desire?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, my independence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">THERAPIST: You're paying for your independence, but the question is, is it really independence after all anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: Well, it's, kind of, very political. Like, you pay taxes and they, you know, go into all these kinds of, you know, initiatives that, kind of, keep you safe and, you know, this and that so yeah, you do pay for independence, right, in the civil society. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">THERAPIST: It's a very good argument. I'm not so sure it translates exactly to the microscopic level, but in a sense, it all speaks to obligations you know, we're not fully independent of others. We do have obligations. The question is how deep do those obligations go. Maybe it's more quantitative in <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B11\">that sense than qualitative. I don't know. We're going to need to stop in a moment, so next week, I'm here Monday, and we'll meet Monday, Wednesday. I'm not here Friday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: And then the following week is Labor Day Memorial Day, so I'm not here Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B9\">THERAPIST: So we only meet Wednesday, and then you're gone, so I just want to make sure, so next week, Monday and Wednesday, and then the following week, just Wednesday -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB\">CLIENT: Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">THERAPIST: And that'll be that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C1\">THERAPIST: So what are your thoughts about Friday?
