I have hives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I mean I didn\u2019t go to the doctor, but this is one of the few times the Internet like nailed it. The pictures. It\u2019s clearly what I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Is it spreading or is it still\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s hives, so it\u2019s one of that\u2026just like for example, now it\u2019s just here. It just keeps moving around. And I just looked over here; now it\u2019s subsided. It\u2019s still kind of there. Like here; it\u2019s kind of\u2026it kind of comes and goes. At night it seems to be the worst, you know. I have a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">antihistamine to not\u2026that I can take during the day then take the Benadryl at night. And I wrote to my doctor. I don\u2019t have insurance right now, but in case she has, you know. But I mean I feel okay right now; just in the evenings it gets very, you know, then it really gets red and kind of\u2026I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">I\u2019ve never had it in my life. But it makes sense with everything else that\u2019s been going on. My body, I think, is just like dude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">[01:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It can be stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2019ve read about that like, you know, hives is one of those weird things where they can never tell exactly what caused it. Stress can be part of it, you know. But, you know, it just happens sometimes. But some things can kind of maybe trigger it, but they\u2019re not sure. So I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">oh; maybe I shouldn\u2019t drink milk anymore or something. For hives, that doesn\u2019t necessarily work, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">But once I have insurance, I do want to see a dermatologist though, because I think I do have a little bit of Rosacea or whatever. Like sometimes I feel a little warm and flushed. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: You may want to see an allergist too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right, an allergist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Maybe you\u2019re having an allergic reaction to something that you don\u2019t know about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I mean one thing that could happen is you develop one suddenly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. It\u2019s very common in allergies to be developed later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">[02:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Developed suddenly. And then today the pharmacist was saying the other thing is you could have been having reactions before, but they were mild, mild, mild, mild and you know what I mean. And you didn\u2019t know that that\u2019s what was happening. And now it\u2019s just a full blown, you know. But there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">no way to know. What am I supposed to do? Cut out everything? You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">[02:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Try a different detergent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry? Detergent\u2019s the first thing, yeah. I\u2019m going to buy some kind of whatever completely\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Sensitive skin; something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Completely non-allergenic. Yeah. Something. Actually, I\u2019m going to do that on my way home. Yeah, because my skin always feels a little itchy or something. I tend to have that kind of thing. Anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">So yeah, Vivian; so the deal is that the job there would be an Adjunct job. She said that\u2019s what most of us are here. And she said there\u2019s like one full professor position opening up that\u2026you can apply for that too if you want. She\u2019s like, in your letter, you don\u2019t have to mention any of that. So I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">guess I\u2019ll do it the way I\u2019m doing it; like I\u2019m thrilled to be considered to be part of the faculty or whatever. She\u2019s like you might want to apply to that; she\u2019s like although I\u2019m not sure\u2026that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s up your alley. It\u2019s a journalism and communications professorship and I bet that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">not me. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">So she\u2019s like so the difference would be they wouldn\u2019t pay for you to come out here and help you find a place to live and all that stuff. The thing, I asked her, I wrote back to her but she said you\u2019ll be paid here instead of there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Here? In the States?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: In Assyria, instead of here in the States. I don\u2019t know what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">[04:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the university. Is she trying to tell me that they\u2019re paying in Assyrian money? I don\u2019t know. I asked her just to clarify that. I doubt that\u2019s the case. I mean it\u2019s an American institution, so I don\u2019t know how they would\u2026maybe she just means\u2026I don\u2019t know; she\u2019ll have to explain that. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">don\u2019t know what that means. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: So is being paid per course then typically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: But she did say something like you could probably teach as many courses as you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d do enough to support...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Do you know how much they pay per course?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Well maybe she\u2019ll answer that now. I just said I\u2019m not sure what you mean by pays there instead of here. I was like I\u2019m sorry to ask you so many questions; I\u2019m just trying to figure out the logistics of how it would work and how I should be approaching it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Why did you apologize?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: No, not in a bad way. Because you know some people are very\u2026they do ask too many questions. Like they\u2019re a little too\u2026I think it\u2019s always polite to just be like, I\u2019m just trying to clarify, you know, as I approach this, what am I getting. Whatever. I think it\u2019s just polite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">[05:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s different than apologizing though. I\u2019m just trying to clarify vs. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m asking too many questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m asking so many questions is the jokey way. You know. It\u2019s like yeah. But whatever. I didn\u2019t want to get in to it on my iPhone. I was like hey; sorry I\u2019m asking you more questions, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: You dismiss it as not that important, but I think there is something hard for you to about actually feeling like you are entitled to those answers; that those are reasonable things to burden her with. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: No, not really. I mean maybe it\u2019s more for me. I just don\u2019t want to complicate something; I\u2019m hoping it works out. So in a way I don\u2019t want to know certain things that might not be beneficial to know. It\u2019s not about her. It\u2019s more like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s just as worrisome, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want to find something out that would make you not want to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Of course I\u2019m going to find out. I mean I\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019m going to find out. But well\u2026but also\u2026honestly, it is an etiquette thing. I\u2019m also not a big fan of e-mails that just keep going back and forth with like question after question. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve never\u2026if she was here, or whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">I would just call her if the time difference wasn\u2019t so weird or whatever. But you know what I mean? I just feel like it\u2019s just like\u2026 \u201cAnd what about this?\u201d \u201cAnd what about that?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry and\u2026?\u201d \u201cOh, I forgot to ask you, what about this?\u201d It\u2019s like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">[07:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you\u2019re nagging her then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nagging; just in general. I find that back and forth to be annoying, whether I\u2019m doing it or someone else is doing it to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Annoying how?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It just is. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like my mom. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like alright. Calm down. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Too many questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. But anyway so, I don\u2019t know. So yeah, it\u2019s basically it\u2019s what I thought it was. Which is still good. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t have a problem with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">[08:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re just missing not being important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: What being important?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Your mom and her 20 questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Oh. Sorry. I\u2019m just out of it man. I have hives. Yeah, that shit\u2019s annoying. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: And I think you to go another extreme to not be like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think in this case it\u2019s just, it seems like that, but it\u2019s not. I mean I\u2019m clear with people when I need to know something; I need to know it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">In this case, yeah, I just\u2026lately things aren\u2019t working out. I would like one thing to just kind of work out. So I think that\u2019s understandable. I mean of course I\u2019m going to find out whatever I need to find out. But it would be nice if it\u2019s just something just kind of works out, you know. Just I\u2019m tired <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">and stressed and frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">I think it\u2019s the opposite. I think in general I\u2019m very good at\u2026that\u2019s the point. I try to find out things up front. Be clear. That way I don\u2019t have to, \u201cWhat about this? What about that?\u201d I just find shit out and then move on. But in the past I used to be more that way for sure, right. Like that\u2019s why <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">it took me so long to deal with my student loans, right. Such an easy thing. I didn\u2019t want the back and forth and finding things out and feeling either bad or upset about, you know. But I don\u2019t feel that anymore.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m avoiding finding things out. I just, yeah; so far it sounds like it\u2019s a pretty uncomplicated situation. And I\u2019m just hoping it just stays that way. That\u2019s all. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">This is crazy. I mean. [Pause.] I don\u2019t want to like over dramatize it. People get hives all the time, I guess. I\u2019ve never gotten hives, but people do. But they\u2019re clearly, to me, I definitely think of it as your body\u2019s trying to tell you something. Because if it\u2019s something they can\u2019t pinpoint; if <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">it\u2019s not I have the flu, so I\u2019ve got a rash, or you know; that\u2019s your body just being off kilter because your mind is just\u2026your brain is just, I don\u2019t know; the wrong kind of, what\u2019s it called? The histamines are just being released from all the stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">[11:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: It seems stress related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2019m not sure. I mean, you know. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all about money. I\u2019m starting to realize it\u2019s not. I think a lot of this is also like, what\u2019s that thing called, Dark Knight of the Soul? What\u2019s the phrase? You know what I\u2019m talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s a very common\u2026I don\u2019t know. Whatever. It\u2019s that period of time when like really you go to this crossroad place in your life. It\u2019s kind of like rock bottom. But not like an attic\u2019s type. It\u2019s like a rock bottom of like really you\u2019re pretty lucid and you\u2019re trying to really confront <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">things that are very very difficult to confront. I think that\u2019s also what\u2019s going on. I think my body is just now revolting in way and saying, \u201cDude.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">Even if there are money issues, that\u2019s really no excuse to not get some writing done; it\u2019s just not. There are so many people that suffer and have suffered real things \u2013 loss of limbs, you know wars, like actual serious illnesses, blindness, who the fuck knows, you know. And they\u2026if they are talented, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">creative people, they find a way to get it done, you know. Why am I still not really? I feel closer, but I\u2019m still not, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">[13:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">So I think it\u2019s all these things coming to a head. Like what am I doing with my life? Like even this life coaching thing; yeah, I do want to do it, but and I know that I\u2019m letting this stuff kind of get me down right now, so I don\u2019t want to over dramatize, be mellow dramatic about it. But even there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">there\u2019s something that I think about\u2026I don\u2019t know. I was just thinking about this. Like am I still not fully committing myself to being the artist that I am? Do you know what I mean? That\u2019s always a question. Like yeah, life coach. Yeah, that does serve a purpose. It would be great. It\u2019s a way to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">money without dealing with a douche bag boss. It\u2019s my business. It\u2019s this and that. Maybe I\u2019m worried that that\u2019s only good if I\u2019m really working on all cylinders as an artist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">But if I\u2019m not doing that, then I start feeling, \u201cWhat the fuck am I doing?\u201d I\u2019m doing this life coach thing but I haven\u2019t written a page. Aren\u2019t I doing that? I thought that I could do this. So, you know what I mean. I think I\u2019ve run out of excuses, basically. So I think that\u2019s part of this too. Between <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">the house money situation and just\u2026I just have a very stark realization that really; there\u2019s nothing; no one is\u2026and as bad as things are, and they\u2019re really that bad \u2013 yeah, like right now I only have like $50 in the bank, but you know what, the flip side of that is I got stuff done with that money. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B12\">My insurance got paid. A couple of things got paid. And in a couple more days I\u2019ll get to my next check and it\u2019s not great, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">So, what\u2019s going on? You know what I mean? I think there is something\u2026 I feel some kind of wall of\u2026and it\u2019s like the book I\u2019m writing. Right. Did we talk about this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">[15:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: No. Not the title.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, my next book of poems. Do you know what that is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Ice and Glass is from Moby Dick where Ishmael is describing the whale and he starts talking it\u2019s body and whatever. And ice and glass is the gelatinous cover, kind of film that it has over its skin. So Ishmael says it\u2019s like the skin of the skin. And it\u2019s fucking brilliant to me. That\u2019s like\u2026so <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">the book is kind of about, you know, what\u2019s beneath the things that we say? What are the other layers of reality that we don\u2019t really understand or we can\u2019t\u2026basically, the mysteriousness that is hard to explain in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">So this kind of feels like, not the skin of the skin, but like the rock bottom of the rock bottom. You know what I mean. You keep thinking you\u2019re hitting rock bottom, but maybe this is really the\u2026you know what I mean. Because I\u2019m very lucid. I feel pretty good overall. So does that make sense? Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">that\u2019s why this reaction, like it\u2019s like I literally don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I try to out trick myself. I try, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll write for two minutes a day.\u201d It\u2019s just not how\u2026I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just not happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">[16:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">I think what it is, is now it\u2019s just will power. Like now it\u2019s just do or die. It\u2019s like you either have will power or you don\u2019t. And if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019ve got to just let it go. You\u2019ve got to just be like, you know what. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ll write a book. But maybe I won\u2019t. You know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">Now, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s being too hard on myself, like\u2026I don\u2019t know. Because it\u2019s been such a heavy month or two, I\u2019m probably being a little too intense about it. But I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Maybe both are true to some degree. Maybe you\u2019re conflicting in yourself and it kind of feels darker because it\u2019s been such a hard couple of months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I was thinking, for example, once we do this reverse mortgage thing, right, come on; am I really going to sit down and then I\u2019m going to get to work and\u2026no. I\u2019m probably not. Right. I\u2019m just going to be happier that I have\u2026I can breathe financially. But I don\u2019t see that changing\u2026right <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">now I was working from home making a paycheck. I didn\u2019t utilize that time to get writing done. So that\u2019s what, I think, has hit a wall now. It\u2019s like wait a second. This is\u2026this is not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">Have I done some stuff? Yeah, I applied for a Connecticut Arts fellowship, you know Council of the Arts, whatever, the state. I applied for that. You know. I got\u2026my friend just did a documentary about an Assyrian poet, very famous Assyrian poet around the Genocide. So I had a great idea to\u2026I got a sneak <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">copy from him. Instead of reviewing it, I want to write like kind of an essay stick from a living young poet and interacting with this dead poet through this documentary or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">[19:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">So I mean there\u2019s stuff going on, obviously. There\u2019s stuff going on. But it\u2019s not\u2026it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not really writing. Yeah. And it\u2019s never substantive writing. You know. So I don\u2019t know if it means I need to somehow get one of those programs where it literally just shuts off all my Internet for like three hours. Like I have to like force myself, I think. I think a lot of people have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">this problem. But for other people, they\u2019re not trying to write a novel. They\u2019re in no\u2026it\u2019s annoying them in different ways. But I think it\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: For a 9 \u2013 5 job, you sort of have to get the job done and then it\u2019s not as impactful to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, but even that; that\u2019s even better in a way because yeah, what do you have to get done? I have to do this report. But you take breaks. You check your Facebook. But when you\u2019re trying to create art, you have to really go in to this deeper, almost like a meditative, especially\u2026poetry is one <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">thing. I can dip in to that and maybe in an hour I can bang out a good poem. And then I can go back to Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">Pros you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t fucking do that. You need a prolonged engagement with that part of you and I\u2019m weak. You know I think we all are. It\u2019s very hard for people to shut everything off. I would need at least half hour, an hour, two hours, three hours. You know. So maybe I do need something. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">have these things now you can opt in to and just shuts it off for whatever you pick. You can go back in, I\u2019m sure, and turn it back on, but at least maybe that\u2019ll train me. Because I think that\u2019s a lot of what it is. I\u2019m already distracted up here. So it\u2019s just too easy. Facebook, read the news, get <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D92\">angry about the news, or get happy about the news. Just engage, you know. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">[21:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s\u2026I\u2019m just saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: It makes a lot of sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: It makes a lot of sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s all, because that\u2019s really all it is now. It\u2019s will power. There\u2019s no excuse. There\u2019s absolutely no excuse. There never was an excuse. But now there really isn\u2019t an excuse. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: The Internet can be a tremendous thing for different people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t have an addictive personality, but I think between not being able to concentrate already, and then having unlimited access to Internet, that doesn\u2019t help. And I think I have a bad combo. Like also like the woman thing; it\u2019s just too easy to go online and look <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">at profiles, write to people. It\u2019s easy, depending on who you are, there\u2019s something for you on the Internet to suck you in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: So whether you\u2019re an online shopper, whether you\u2019re\u2026whatever it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Actually, I think that any time a person is spending more than an hour or a two \u2013 even an hour or two is a lot \u2013 on the Internet, it is a problem.

I got an e-mail from my second cousin, one of my second cousins in San Francisco who\u2019s in his 20\u2019s now. My first cousin\u2019s kid on my dad\u2019s side. Very nice kid.

He says, I was at grandma\u2019s \u2013 so he was at my aunt\u2019s house\u2026my dad\u2019s older sister \u2013 and I saw this picture. We were looking at pictures; she showed me this picture. And he said your dad\u2019s the one between his grandmother and mother. There\u2019s a picture, then, of my dad\u2019s family. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201112\">my dad\u2019s like four.

Like, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Could feel closer to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">[26:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, as a little kid. And, of course, he\u2019s like the coolest little kid, even at that age. He\u2019s like hey, what\u2019s up. He was like four. And it\u2019s one of those, you know, like 1935\u2026no, no, no. Must be like \u201838, \u201839, \u201840. So it was very black and white. No one\u2019s smiling. You know it\u2019s very, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">one of those things, you know. And his grandmother, my great grandmother\u2026my grandmother; he\u2019s between them. My uncle who\u2019s left {\u2013 27:06] now. But then my other uncle died, the one I knew really well. And then my two aunts and my grandfather. So it\u2019s like a\u2026I\u2019ve never seen any of them at that age. Never, never.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">So yeah, that was just amazing. Absolutely amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">So I wonder if on some level that did something? [Pause.] I showed it to my mom. It was cool. She was like blown away. And it also reinforced how much I need to go out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">You know my aunt, really, I could sit with her for days. I\u2019m sure the photos and things they have are\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">[28:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I wonder what the something is that did?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: I think it is\u2026I mean obviously it\u2019s my dad, so it brought up a lot of something, you know. I\u2019m not quite\u2026I think if it had been some years ago, I would have literally just broken down or something like that. You know. It\u2019s just kind of sad, but it just reminded me of how much I love him or that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D1\">he had a whole life before me that I don\u2019t know\u2026I wish I knew more about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">But then also the whole family, right. There\u2019s this uncle who\u2019s still alive who I don\u2019t know now if I\u2019m ever going to be able to meet. Who I fucked up when I went there by not meeting him, out of my own naivety, you know. So there\u2019s that. My other uncle has passed away, who I miss. And then these two <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F1\">aunts who are really fucking old. I mean really, once you get past 80, 85, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">So a lot different feelings. But the one that I can act on is that I need to see these people. At least the ones in San Francisco This is really\u2026that\u2019s another thing. Yes money is money, but that\u2019s got to happen. I would feel really shitty if I didn\u2019t get to see these people and spend quality time with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201311\">them just a little bit more, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20130-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20130-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">And then my uncle\u2026I\u2019m trying to get a letter and send him some money, but I want to write him a letter in Assyrian. I just want him to know, like, that I felt so shitty because I didn\u2019t see him when I was in the Middle East and that I was just na\u00efve. I didn\u2019t think clearly, you know. I just, you know; <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">I don\u2019t know. Because I think he\u2019s kind of, not upset; it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll close the door in my face, but he\u2019ll give me a hard time a little bit, you know, and I don\u2019t blame him. To him it\u2019s like, he didn\u2019t see me there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">[30:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">And then when I came to San Francisco he didn\u2019t see me. You know, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: Do you know what stopped you? You keep saying na\u00efve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: Honestly, when I went to the Middle East I just was\u2026I wasn\u2019t\u2026I mean yeah, this is 2001. You know, I was in that place and it did not even cross my fucking mind that they would come to me. I don\u2019t know why. It just did not. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019d never been to that part of the world. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B1\">Obviously, I know it\u2019s not that far once you\u2019re there. But somehow I thought that\u2019s kind of a big deal. Or I didn\u2019t even think it consciously. On a subconscious level, I just thought these are two very different faraway places and I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">But really, once you get\u2026I mean I was there for that day. That\u2019s what, another\u2026whatever it is. Let\u2019s say another six hours. I mean I\u2019m all the way there in that part of the world. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s something I won\u2019t be able to kind of forgive myself for. You know. Especially because now even if I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D1\">could go now, forget it. I\u2019m not going to be able to even enjoy. Those buildings were destroyed. Everything\u2019s flattened. That history that was there that I would have wanted to\u2026I can get nothing out of that now. So the least I can do is at least, in my own hands, just write to him and reach out to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">[32:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: [inaudible \u2013 32:05] time without your dad too. You know you say buildings destroyed now. I can\u2019t go back. You can\u2019t get time back. You can\u2019t have him back. [inaudible \u2013 32:15].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, but I\u2019ve kind of made more peace with\u2026yeah, someone\u2019s gone, they\u2019re just gone. But when people are living and you can at least try to, that\u2019s on you. You know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Lots of feelings you\u2019re writing too are something of sort of facing what\u2019s on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I\u2019ve always been saying that, but now I really; I feel like it\u2019s very stark kind of like it\u2019s just will power. You\u2019ve got to suck it up. I don\u2019t care whether you can concentrate or not. It\u2019s becoming kind of just a broken record at this point. Because I don\u2019t see any <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201471\">difference. When I had a girlfriend, everything was great. It\u2019s not like I went home and I sat down and I wrote 10 chapters. I did nothing. Everything else is peripheral nonsense. It\u2019s like you either have the will power to see through this thing, or you don\u2019t. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all there is to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">So it\u2019s either like I\u2019m scared to do it. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll actually do it and it\u2019ll be good. Or I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll do it and nothing will come of it. Who knows? But again, that\u2019s really neither here nor there. Obviously, I\u2019m compelled to do it otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about it this much. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201491\">It\u2019s not like a hobby or something like that. You know, obviously there\u2019s some very intense drive to create, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20148-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20148-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">[34:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Well I might add that I think there is something more to it than will power even though I hear everything you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s really important; that kind of facing the music experience. There has been a phase recently. I know it\u2019s not something you can hold on to as a long term thing where <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D1\">you started to write more. You\u2019ve found places where you\u2019ve written more where you come up with a story line, you come up with a rubber plan, you come up with a title of your book of poems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">There times, and over the course of this work, where you\u2019ve\u2026something\u2019s lit up, even it hasn\u2019t lasted. It still is something that feels different than how it is often. So I wonder if there\u2019s something about something moving inside you that makes being alone feel like it\u2019s a bearable place to be; alone <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">with your writing. Like actually the thing when you are alone it\u2019s quiet and calm enough that you can be creative. But I think alone, very quickly, goes back to not feeling that way, especially in the midst of something like this; like another external descending of an authority and you know, limitations <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F2\">and restrictions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: Like this one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: So just the everything going on with money right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Oh right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: I think like how could that now be pulling you back more to feeling just radically alone [inaudible \u2013 35:57] or like an outsider?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s an excuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: No, no. But I\u2019m\u2026I guess what I\u2019m saying, though, is that in a way I should feel relieved. That\u2019s kind of what feels different this time a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">We have a house. What I was saying yesterday. Let\u2019s say\u2026I mean the reverse mortgage is going to happen. She\u2019s qualified. It\u2019s a very easy; I mean it\u2019s just going to happen regardless of the amount they give us. If nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing else, bills are going to be paid. We\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F1\">to have breathing room. Right. Forget about buying another place. Let\u2019s say that didn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re going to have breathing room to be able to pay things off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">[36:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">B.) Let\u2019s say the reverse mortgage didn\u2019t happen for whatever reason. Well, I can put the house on the market for $900K, $950K and see what happens. Someone might probably buy it. In other words, I\u2019m not sure why\u2026or I am maybe possibly sure why that\u2019s not\u2026it\u2019s not comforting somehow that much. Whereas <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201631\">in the past it was. In the past, when, again, because I was stupid, right, something would just happen and I\u2019d suddenly have a little bit of money. A friend would help me or some scholarship or my uncle. But nothing would happen beyond that. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">Just that I\u2019m\u2026something in me is freaking out. I think that the money thing is one way or the other going to get resolved. I\u2019m freaking out already at the\u2026I\u2019m pre\u2026what\u2019s the word?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: Pre-emptive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Pre-emptive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m pre-emptively freaking out at the fact that the money thing is one way or the other going to get resolved. And I\u2019m still going to be watching Netflix and having these same struggles with creativity. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\u2026and I think that\u2019s maybe good. Because maybe you need\u2026that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D1\">to say; it\u2019s the rock bottom of the rock bottom. Maybe you need that.

So even if things are going really well on the external, what\u2019s happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201731\">inside you that it\u2019s still hard to get going to commit yourself? I don\u2019t know exactly, even still, what that means to sit there and write what happens inside your experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">There\u2019s a very very very early unconscious level in this I think. I mean you\u2019re speaking to the conscious rational stuff, which is getting more and more rational. You get that it\u2019s going to work out with money. You\u2019re going to figure a way. You have all these ways. You\u2019re problem solving now. Find your <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201751\">way through. It\u2019s not going to be the end of the world. So what else is there? What\u2019s the thing that is still unconsciously haunting you? You know like who\u2019s [inaudible \u2013 39:24]? What\u2019s happening alone in your bed at night that it is terrifying to be alone for a long time? Does writing mean being alone? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201752\">The Internet becomes a way of filling up being alone. Exactly what you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">THERAPIST: So what happens when you shut it off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">[39:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">CLIENT: Right yeah. Because then you have to try to make real connections with people. Or a real connection with yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Like us here. What happens if we stop talking about money or about this, going to get a job, or this business plan? Then what happens when you don\u2019t have the Internet in here? You know. What\u2019s there? Will you be abandoned or left alone, will you be smothered? All early, early\u2026I\u2019m talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F1\">even infant level kinds of things. Anxieties and fears about what\u2019s eating away another person that way\u2026at the most important stage of their\u2026start to get access to. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">CLIENT: I mean I think maybe that\u2019s what it is. I mean like...why do I hate \u2013 not hate \u2013 you know I avoid going to certain shows. I don\u2019t like to hear about certain things. Why? Because it\u2019s like a jealous; it\u2019s like a\u2026it just reminds me of feelings of like unfairness or why aren\u2019t people noticing what <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201811\">I do? You know what I mean? Why aren\u2019t people championing what I do? Why aren\u2019t they whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever? And I become more and more aware of that. It\u2019s not healthy. You know, that\u2019s not healthy. I\u2019m not able to go to a show and be like, hey cool man; this is really awesome. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201812\">always a part of me\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">Part of that\u2019s normal. The musical side or the writer\u2019s side. Or if I go to\u2026I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m listening to the music and I\u2019m kind of deconstructing it as a musician. But that\u2019s very different from being bothered; that everyone else is really crazy about this music. So what? It\u2019s like I take it personally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201831\">you know. That goes back to what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s like this old like if you like them so much, that means you\u2019re automatically neglecting me, which is a bizarre, irrational conclusion to draw. You know what I mean. People like a lot of bands, you know. On this particular night, they\u2019re seeing this <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201832\">band. They love it, or whatever. You know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20182-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20182-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561752\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20185\">[43:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20187\">But it becomes like very childish to me.

That was built in to your relationship. It wasn\u2019t just she would admire somebody you knew; fundamentally, you were <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201891\">admired too. It\u2019s a comment on you. So of course you carry around inside you. If someone loves this band, it\u2019s a comment on how much they don\u2019t love you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But also then, the second part of that is that it reinforces her voice.

That\u2019s what happens, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">So now then when you\u2019re trying to write a novel, that\u2019s pretty intense. You\u2019re trying to write something serious where it takes consistent engagement on a particular\u2026like a zone you have to be in right. So well if on some deep level, you\u2019re already have the normal things that people have. Like will <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201911\">it be good? Will it get published? Whatever. That\u2019s a lot already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">But then on top of that for like, eh, even if it does get published, right\u2026like when my book came out, once I saw it, I was excited for a good day or whatever, and then, whatever. So there\u2019s that. Then I\u2019ll write it. Yeah, maybe it\u2019ll get published. But people will like it, but you know, there are a <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201931\">slew of other writers that are definitely way\u2026that they are way crazier about, or whatever. There\u2019s some, you know\u2026which is rational in the context of my mom, but really irrational. I mean that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s like saying, you know, I want money but there\u2019s always going to be someone that has more money than <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201932\">you, less money than you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20195\">[45:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20197\">So there are going to be people that are better writers, worse writers, or different writers; that different kinds of people with different kinds of taste. I mean that\u2019s nonsense to start putting yourself in some kind of weird hierarchy of\u2026that\u2019s the last thing an artist gives a shit about. But if that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201971\">your childhood and if you\u2019re, you know, constantly being compared and this and that and put down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20199\">THERAPIST: RJ, you\u2019re very good at challenging cognitive distortion. Like you know how to speak about all these things rationally. But I don\u2019t think they touch the feelings inside this that are with you. The self-loathing; the feeling that you\u2019re not good enough. That it\u2019s not going to be good enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201991\">when you write. That someone else really is going to be a lot better. It\u2019s a very degraded set of feelings about yourself that I know you\u2019re not\u2026one level is not rational. These are the feelings that are giving you hives, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D\">THERAPIST: And you have so much more to get to know about. [Pause.] Until tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F\">CLIENT: 2:20 tomorrow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A3\">CLIENT: 2:20. Okay. Thanks Claire. See you tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A5\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
