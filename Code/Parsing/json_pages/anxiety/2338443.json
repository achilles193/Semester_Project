Oh man. It's like I'm not afraid, but I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: How do you do with giving speeches?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: If I can translate what I write on paper and make that...if I can project it, that would be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: But I have a hard time with doing that. You know, it's almost like you probably realize that I have a hard time explaining myself, you know, or at least I feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Oh okay. So wait a second. You know what I'm about to say. [Laughter.] You're assuming that I have a hard time...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Maybe understanding some things when I...no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">[01:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Where did you get that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I don't know. Because I feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Okay. Explain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: You know so I'm thinking if I feel like I have a hard time explaining myself, then other people are going to have a hard time understanding what I'm saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Have you gotten feedback that you're difficult to understand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Where did you come up with that then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: I don't know. Well, because I think...okay, like a lot of times if I'm asked a question I know the answer to it, but trying to explain it, you know. A lot of times I feel like I put my foot in my mouth. You know, so I'm really trying to figure out a way that I can...oh, I don't know; put my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">words together. You know what I mean? To say what it is that I know I need to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Okay. Where do you notice you struggle the most?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Can't get it out. [Laughter.] You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">[02:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: I can write it down and you can tell me to write something and I have no problem. You know, I can write and once I get going, oh, I can go. Right. But then when I try to, you know, and it's really I'm at the point now where I say okay, well you have to speak, you know. I have to get it together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: So is that why you decided to join the speech club for your upcoming conference presentation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Well I want to be a good leader.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: You know what I mean. And in order to lead, I have to be able to, you know, get my words out that I have to be able to say it. I have to be able to think on my feet and I need that because I cannot do that. [Laughter.] You know. So I feel like I have the energy. I feel like the drive is there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200591\">you know. I want to do it. But it's getting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">You know I think I told you before that sometimes I feel like \u2013 oh how is it? See what I mean. [Laughter.] And I just have to laugh it off because it's like I know; I know what I want to say, but you know. So it's like if I can take what I'm thinking and just say it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">[03:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">And my son tells me this all the time. You know, he always says, Ma, just like you're talking to me, just say it. He said you make you everything difficult. You know and I'm trying to figure out how, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338443\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Well, okay. So let me ask you a question. So does this just happen to you when you speak publicly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: No. You know it's like sometimes I can be engaged in a conversation and what I need to say I can just say it. But then there are those times where it's like I draw a blank and that's when I told you before about my memory. I feel like I forget stuff and it's like I know I know. You know. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">why can't I think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">[04:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: So you draw a blank and then what happens?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: And then like the person is still talking and I'm so set back on what it was that I missed a few minutes ago, and then it'll just pop up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Alright. So when you give it a second and think about it, it comes back to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Have you ever seen President Barack Obama speak?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: What do you notice about the way that he speaks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: I notice that he takes his time and I notice that he says uh, a lot. And I said well he is probably the only person in the world that can get away with that because he has to be very very careful about what he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">Now, and...[laughs], and I notice that he's very articulate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: He is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: You know. He doesn't really; it doesn't take him a long long time to get it. It's like he pauses, he thinks for a minute, and then he can just go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: So by your own admission, he says \"uh\" a lot and he pauses. And people wait for him to finish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">[05:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: So before he was \u2013 obviously he's been a Senator, he's the President, he was a law professor \u2013 so he's used to public speaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: So even in public speaking he says \"uh\" and he pauses. He pauses a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: A lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: He's a, you know, sometimes he's a slower speaker. I mean, but he's a very good speaker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: Good speaker. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Alright. So why do you think you can't pause to get your thoughts together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: Because it's almost like when I'm reading. If I read to slow, it's like I can't comprehend what I'm reading. But if I read right through, then it's like I can get it. And then the only problem about that is, is if I run across a word that I don't know the meaning of, I have a habit of stopping. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200911\">I have to grab that dictionary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Alright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">[06:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: And then I have to be able to take that word and I have to like substitute a word in there that I know will fit and still mean the same thing and then I'll go back and read it and use that word again, and then get it. And I feel like it takes me so long to get through...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: You are making a decision to do that because why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: To make sure that I have the right understanding of what the author is trying to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Alright, but if you just read it, you could get the word by the context clues. You could get the general meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: I think so, but then it's that thing in the back of my head that tells me unless I get that dictionary, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But in some ways you stop to teach yourself the word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Alright, so you...and that's one strategy. It's like old school, they were like, okay, if you don't know the word, go get the dictionary.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338443\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: So you stop to teach yourself the word to substitute a synonym or a similar sounding word in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But you could read it and get the general meaning of the sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: You wouldn't maybe know exactly what that word meant, but you could kind of figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">[07:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But you're choosing to look it up so that you can really know what it means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: But either way, whether you stop, get a dictionary, use a synonym or keep reading, you're going to get the meaning of the word. You are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Okay, when I read and I don't know a word, I'm too lazy to get the dictionary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: [Laughing.] I don't believe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I absolutely promise you it's the truth, right. You know, sometimes I'll ask my husband what does this mean or whatever, and he'll go, oh let me look it up. If he doesn't know, I'm like ugh, forget about it. Right. Perhaps I'm just too lazy, but most times I can still get the general gist. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C31\">But in some ways, the reason why you stop is you're using this to question your intelligence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Alright. Just like when you speak and you pause, what's really tripping you up is you're using this to sort of validate this idea that you're not smooth or you don't know what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">[08:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">THERAPIST: But that's not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">CLIENT: But it feels like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yes, but that's your stuff. Right. Your audience. If you're talking about a topic, right, in class and you pause...here's one thing I learned about teaching. Right. So let's say I'm teaching you something and I say you know what, hang on just a second.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I get a piece of paper and I look over on my notes. And then I go back to teaching. What do you think of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">CLIENT: I just think that maybe you know, you just forgot something and you went back through your notes and it reminded you and you can go ahead and keep on going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Do you make an assumption about my intelligence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">[09:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Do you make an assumption about anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: I figured that out too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Right. So in the beginning, as a very young teacher, I used to think I had to have it all in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yes. So this is not an issue of how articulate you are per se, or it's not an issue that you don't know your stuff. It's an issue that because you constantly question yourself, you slow yourself down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">CLIENT: You told me that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">THERAPIST: So if I read a word and I don't understand what it means, I have some confidence that even if I don't know what that one word means, I'm going to get the general jest and I don't have to know what that one word means. And if I really want to know, I guess I'll get myself up off the couch <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF1\">and go get the dictionary. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">[10:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">THERAPIST: But I don't question that I'm not going to be able to get it generally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">CLIENT: You know I've been like this all my life because even as a kid, you know, and I'm reading something, I always felt like I could not comprehend what I was reading. You know, I don't know why I always felt like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Well, so here's a...is it true, you know? Is it absolutely true that when you read something you have a hard time understanding it? If you are honest with yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338443\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: If I'm honest with myself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: If I'm honest with yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: I think sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">THERAPIST: Alright, tell me about, because some of this is you questioning yourself, and I wonder if some of this is a true issue that you actually aren't comprehending. So tell me about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">CLIENT: Because I'm wondering too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">THERAPIST: Okay, tell me...

I'm drawing a blank here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">THERAPIST: Self-doubt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">CLIENT: Oh well yeah, that's pretty good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Okay. Can we come up with a name for self-doubt? Like what's a funny name, a crazy name.

We call it Oh Really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20131\">CLIENT: Oh Really. I mean because it's almost like \"really?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20133\">THERAPIST: And what do you mean when you say that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20135\">CLIENT: Okay, given the position I'm in now and if you had to put it on a scale, from where I was to where I am now, and now I'm starting to think I have a hard time comprehending, it doesn't go together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20137\">[13:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20139\">THERAPIST: Oh wow, can you say that again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">THERAPIST: I think you should say that again.

Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013F\">CLIENT: Given where I was to where I am now, and thinking I have a hard time comprehending, doesn't go together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20141\">THERAPIST: So it's not true. So you would say it's not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20143\">CLIENT: No, it's not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20145\">THERAPIST: Okay, so we're going to call it Oh Really or Not True?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20147\">CLIENT: We're going to call it Not True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20149\">THERAPIST: So we're going to call your self-doubt Not True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Yes. The self-doubt is real and I don't want to minimize that. But that's what the difference between your reading something and not comprehending a word, it's almost like you feel like to be smart you have to absolutely understand everything 100%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20151\">THERAPIST: That is not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20153\">CLIENT: Because it's like, okay, when I come in here and I talk to you and everything, I feel like you got it.

I think, I mean, seriously. You know, the intellect and I mean, it's fascinating to me, but I feel like why can't I remember so I can be, you know? It's like, I feel like when someone comes up to me and we're engaged in a conversation, and I can just pop <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201711\">right in and I know, you know, oh, yeah, I can conversate with them. I know what they're talking about without self-doubt. Like you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">THERAPIST: What are we calling self-doubt again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20175\">CLIENT: Not True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20177\">THERAPIST: Not True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20179\">CLIENT: Right.

Okay, and I like you a lot, which is, you know, and I think that we have a good rapport which helps, but what you see between us sort of is not only built on our genuine relationship, but it's a practiced skill. Alright. There are skills that you have in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201811\">your life you've practiced a long time. Give me an idea of some of those skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20183\">CLIENT: That I've practiced?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20185\">THERAPIST: For a really long time; that you just kind of do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20187\">CLIENT: Hmm, that I just kind of do. Take care of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20189\">THERAPIST: Okay, exactly. So you know, whether it's doing CPR, whether it's handling crises, people look at you and go my God, how can you do that? You keep cool in a situation. You're the person in your family people go to with solutions. Right. So you're going to take that skill set and translate <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201891\">it into a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2018B\">So for me, what are you watching here besides our work together? A practiced skill set. Alright. So what do I do for a living? I talk to people and I teach. So I talk all the time. Alright. If you watched me do a math problem, you would probably weep for me because I am...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2018D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2018F\">THERAPIST: I am terrible at math.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20191\">CLIENT: Me too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20193\">THERAPIST: I am abysmal. Alright. So I can relate to you in terms of understanding. I never felt like I was very bright, Yvette, especially when it came to math and standardized tests because I just did not do well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20195\">CLIENT: That is how I feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20197\">THERAPIST: Yes, right. But if you look at the things that you do with your family and if you look at you nursing, you are an automatic. It's not that you don't work at those things, but you're good at it and it's a practiced skill set. You know you're sort of comparing what you see and hear, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201971\">we're working with your vulnerability, and I've just kind of told you some of mine, but you're watching a skillet that I've been practicing for a really long time. And when you take what you're already good at and you put that in to a career, people will look at you and go wow. And you know it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201972\">your professors already look at you and go wow. They want you to go speak and they constantly validate how bright you are. The only person having a hard time believing it is you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338443\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20199\">[18:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B\">CLIENT: Is me.

And then I ask myself that repeatedly, \"Why can I not see what everybody else sees?\" I think I had that conversation with you before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and what do you think the answer is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C9\">CLIENT: I'm thinking; that's what I think. I think it's because I feel like my memory is just not, you know, it's just not there. It's like...if you ask me right now when I first walked through that door today what's the first thing that you said to me or the first thing I said to you, I couldn't tell you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Uh, I can't tell you what the first thing I said, so why, I don't...I can't. I have no idea what I said five minutes ago. None.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CD\">CLIENT: Oh. Oh for real?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CF\">THERAPIST: And I can tell you because it happens to me when I'm teaching and I'll say, I'll stop and I will completely forget something and then I will say to my students who know me well, I'll say, \"What was I talking about?\" And they'll say you were talking about this. Maybe you do have memory problems. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CF1\">I don't want to say you don't. But the weight that you put on them, you attach a label to it and the label you attach is \"I'm not smart,\" or \"I'm not smart enough,\" or \"I don't understand a word, I'm not smart.\" And that then puts you in to this psychological process that takes your concentration away <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CF2\">from what you're doing, and then you feel bad. And then Mr. Not True shows up. Instead of going, oh, that's no big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D1\">[21:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D3\">So when I forget something in a classroom because it's a practiced skill, I don't even pay attention. It's so no big deal, it's like a big joke. And it doesn't mean, you know, that I don't know what I'm talking about. It just means I forgot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D5\">CLIENT: But all the time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Well, so and when President Obama pauses and says \"Um,\" nobody says well he's an awful public speaker. They may not like what he's saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338443\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">CLIENT: No, I think it's because they understand that he has to because he has to be very careful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Well, that may be the case, but people don't say he's not a bright man because he stops and pauses. But when you stop and pause and you can't remember something, Mr. Not True shows up and you make the assumptions because you're not bright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">CLIENT: Well yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">THERAPIST: But it doesn't mean that. So if Mr. Not True, you know, if we took him and removed him and it just was you couldn't remember something, or it was just, you know, you had to stop and think about it and it didn't mean that you weren't bright, how would that change your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E1\">CLIENT: Oh, if I removed them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E3\">THERAPIST: If you removed them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E5\">CLIENT: Ah man. Whew. I don't know. It would probably take off like...but then...but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E7\">THERAPIST: How would it change your life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E9\">CLIENT: [Pause.] I mean it would change in a good way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EB\">THERAPIST: How would it feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201ED\">CLIENT: Oh, it should feel really good, you know, I'm thinking. It should feel great. And I want to like drop him off at like the nearest bus station. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Can you close your eyes for a second?

I think. Actually I would feel like I did it. I would feel like that was easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20205\">THERAPIST: And would that feel like confidence to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20207\">CLIENT: Confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20209\">THERAPIST: So what does confidence feel like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2020B\">CLIENT: Confidence feels like I just mastered something that I thought was going to be very very difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2020F\">CLIENT: When it wasn't difficult at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20211\">[24:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20213\">THERAPIST: So if you or maybe it was difficult and you still did a good job anyway. So if you walked through the world with a sense of confidence, what would it feel like to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20215\">CLIENT: I could accomplish anything.

Isn't that a sense of confidence?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20219\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2021B\">THERAPIST: You have confidence in many ways, you just don't acknowledge it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2021D\">CLIENT: So how can I acknowledge it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2021F\">THERAPIST: What would it be like if you did acknowledge it? Like you feel like if you work hard enough you can do anything. Well how do you know that's true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20221\">CLIENT: Well, I went to the career center yesterday and I took the strength assessment test.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20223\">THERAPIST: Yes, I'm aware of that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20225\">CLIENT: Okay, and as I was taking this test, I liked the way the categories were broken down and as I move from one section to the other, I said, ah, hmm. I said, okay, I see where this is going. You know, it's like the question that it would ask and I instantly, the very first one was accounting, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N202251\">I put no. You know. Totally dislike accounting. Anything that had something to do with math, handling other people's money, stuff like that, I run from.

And when I got to college, I had college algebra again <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2025D1\">at a community college, right, and I did okay in it, but I had to start back at intermediate algebra when I was in college, alright, at a community college, to be tutored because I had to take statistics as part of psychology. And I had a tutor in math every step of the way even in my doctoral program <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2025D2\">in grad school. I've had math tutors my whole life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2025F\">CLIENT: I think I'm going to be just like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20261\">THERAPIST: But my point is you have exulted me to be this highly intelligent person, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20263\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20265\">THERAPIST: And somehow you're not an intelligent person because you struggle with math when you really don't; you just haven't practiced it in years. You know, or you compare a set of practiced skills that someone has and say well I can't do that, so I'm less. But some part of you has confidence because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202651\">you keep doing all of these things and being successful. So you have a lot of guts within you and some part of you knows you can do it and do it well or you wouldn't keep doing it.

You write business plans and books and you know decide...if you didn't actually think you could do it, you wouldn't be doing some of these things. But you have to learn to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202711\">take it in you and make yourself feel good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20273\">The other thing is, you can't learn something to mastery if you don't integrate it in to yourself. So the reason why Barack Obama can pause during a speech is because he trusts himself to give a good speech whether he pauses, forgets something, says \"Uh,\" right, he trusts himself to give a good speech <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202731\">because he has had years of practicing that style.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20275\">[31:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20277\">CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense.

Now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202AB\">THERAPIST: Wait. Can we hold pride for a second? Just hold proud. Just hold on to it before you kick it away. Let it rest there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202AD\">CLIENT: I was getting ready to kick it away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202AF\">THERAPIST: You about missed yourself; was about to kick away. Mr. Not True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B3\">THERAPIST: So what was supposed to happen is you have this great GPA and you should go wow. And then the next semester you'd be able to trust that if you continue to work hard and learn everything and learn, that that becomes consistent. Not perfect, but consistent over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B7\">[33:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202B9\">THERAPIST: Right, so when you write, are you a good writer? Honestly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202BB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N202BD\">THERAPIST: Okay, thank you very much. Yes.

It begins to build confidence. Alright, so when you get the odd Bor something like that on one assignment, you don't go, \"Oh, I'm a terrible writer,\" you just go that's odd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202CB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N202CD\">THERAPIST: And you don't let it knock your confidence. So all of these experiences of success should help you build confidence because nobody but you are doing these things.

We happened to...we have a class together. And we always speak to each other. I speak to everybody, it doesn't matter. And this one particular day we happened to come in to the school at the same time. And we just started talking and then she said I tried to \u2013 what was that she told me? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202FF1\">She said; no, she asked me about an assignment and I had to ask her what class do I have with you again? And when she told me that, I said, oh, okay. And then we just started talking, you know, and she started sharing some really intimate things with me and stuff and I just listened, you know. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20301\">THERAPIST: How often does that happen to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20303\">[36:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20305\">CLIENT: A lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20307\">THERAPIST: Right.

I think I'm a good listener.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20317\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20319\">CLIENT: And I try to be as honest with people, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2031B\">THERAPIST: Why are people attracting to you?

They say, like you just said, how do you do that? How do you speak to everybody? How is it that you're always happy? How is it that? And then I'll tell them well, because I don't put my burdens off on anybody. You know, if <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203451\">whatever it is that I may be dealing with at home or I don't bring school home, you know. I just think there's a place and time for everything. And the people that I encounter, you know, why should I bog them down with stuff. I don't even know what they're dealing with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20347\">THERAPIST: But Yvette, some part of you knows you're really good at it, or you wouldn't keep doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20349\">CLIENT: Well, I just think that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2034B\">THERAPIST: No, it's a skill.

Alright, it's not something everyone can do. It's part of who you are. So, that's why I'm saying you should enjoy it. Use it to mastery. It's that skill set you're going to put in to a profession. So when you say I'm going to go back to you and I and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203531\">you say you can just say things or whatever. So some of that is me \u2013 I'm social. Part of who I am \u2013 and some of it's a practiced skill set and you have equally honed practiced skill sets that other people connect to that you're really good at, and that's what you use to build your confidence and make <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203532\">yourself feel good. We all have things that we can do individually that other people cannot do that makes us special. We each have unique gifts, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20355\">So you recognize your gifts, but you have to really \u2013 what's the word I'm looking for \u2013 you really have to celebrate your gifts. Practice them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20357\">[40:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20359\">CLIENT: Celebrate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035B\">THERAPIST: Celebrate, accept, practice, use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2035F\">THERAPIST: You know, hone, right, and you have been. So it's time to recognize it because Mr. what did we say self-doubt was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20361\">CLIENT: Mr. Not So whatever. What is he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20363\">THERAPIST: Whatever.

He's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2036B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's handicapping you because you read something and you think you have problems with reading comprehension and you don't. Right. So how do you know the difference between not really understanding the material and just not understanding a word? And when Mr. Self-doubt \u2013 we had a name; <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2036B1\">see neither one of us can remember the name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2036D\">CLIENT: I know. Can't even remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2036F\">[41:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20371\">THERAPIST: Right, but what...it's not the same. You have to trust your brain. It's amazing when you do. You have to know what your brain does well and doesn't do well, but when you trust your brain and trust yourself, you know, you kind of know what you're good at, what you're not good at, and you feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N203711\">good about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20370-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20370-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338443\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20373\">CLIENT: And it's funny you say that because I felt like that before.

You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20375\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20377\">CLIENT: I felt like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20379\">THERAPIST: Is that true?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2037B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2037D\">THERAPIST: Good! Trust your brain. Enjoy how bright you are. I mean enjoy it. Don't doubt it. It doesn't mean you're good at everything. Right. I've had to get comfortable with the fact that I'm just really not that good at math except when it comes to money. I can do math in my head. You put a $ sign <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2037D1\">behind it, I'm like oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2037F\">CLIENT: I can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20381\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And clearly I have gotten whatever it is I need to get okay from my mathematical experiences, right, and I'm doing something that highlights my strengths and minimizes my weaknesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20383\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20385\">[42:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20387\">THERAPIST: Alright, so I have enough about what I do that makes me feel good professionally, right, and confident professionally all while understanding that I'm not good at everything, and I'm okay with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20389\">CLIENT: So Dr. Helm, let me ask you this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2038A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2038B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2038C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2038D\">CLIENT: Now, at the point where I am now, okay, so it's okay to not know everything that there is about math, even at the point where I am now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2038E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2038F\">THERAPIST: How could you ever know everything there is to know about math?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20390\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20391\">CLIENT: Okay, well maybe I didn't say that right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20392\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20393\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20394\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20395\">CLIENT: Let's see, how can I say it? Okay, let me use this example. A friend of mine called me.

Now, back when I was helping her with her math, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203951\">I was actually in class and had math class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20396\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20397\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you were practicing the skill set.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20398\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20399\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039B\">THERAPIST: So it was right in front of your face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039D\">CLIENT: It was right in front of my face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2039E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2039F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A1\">[43:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A3\">CLIENT: Now she calls me and says I have these two friends, you know, that need help with their math and I told them how you helped me and how you broke it down where I could understand it. You know, and I asked her, I said, well what kind of math is it? She couldn't tell me. I said well find out from <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N203A31\">them what kind of math it is and then I'll see what I can do. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A5\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A7\">CLIENT: She said well I told them that you'd probably charge like...I said, nope; I'm not going to charge them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203A8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203A9\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AB\">CLIENT: You know, because I don't know if I know how to help them for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AD\">THERAPIST: But some part of you believes that you might be able to do it or you wouldn't do it; you would have said no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203AE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203AF\">CLIENT: Right, and see what I was going to do was I said to myself now in all honesty I said, okay, no matter what math it is, they should have a book. The book has examples, and I'll follow the example, and apply it to whatever the question is and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B1\">THERAPIST: Okay, and that's my point. That some part of you knows that if you get that book and you look at it you will figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B3\">CLIENT: My comprehension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B5\">[44:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B7\">THERAPIST: The same part of that knows that if I got that book I would be useless in that. I can't, huh uh. It doesn't matter how many times. Huh uh. But you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203B9\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N203BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203BB\">THERAPIST: Yes! I am absolutely serious. But you know you can get that book and you can figure it out. That's confidence. Right. See you have to take the lid off of it and drink it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N203BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N203BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2338443\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BD\">CLIENT: I have to take the lid off and drink it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203BE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203BF\">THERAPIST: And feel good about it. Right. You know, if you asked me to tutor someone in something else that I was good at, I'd feel the same way. Oh yeah, just give me the book. I can figure it out. But you can do that with many things. Feel good about the things that you're good at. You are not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203BF1\">to be arrogant. You are not an arrogant person, but you can feel really good about your brain. It's important to you, you value learning, you're smart. Well you might as well celebrate your brain. You might as well get to know it really well, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C1\">[45:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C3\">When I say that, you know, you're going on to grad school I'm sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C7\">THERAPIST: Okay, so one of the things that going from undergrad to grad school teaches you is it's a further practice of skill set \u2013 writing, reading, it takes you...you learn how long something takes you to do. You learn how to integrate or pool together information well. Alright. So you like stretching <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203C71\">your brain Yvette.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203C9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CB\">THERAPIST: That's one of the reasons why you said yes to tutoring math because part of you is intellectually curious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203CE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203CF\">THERAPIST: Alright, but that's what you want to build on. If you didn't think you could do it, you wouldn't. So you should feel really good about that. That's part of your confidence. You don't really doubt yourself as much as you think you do. But self-doubt prevents you from really enjoying just how <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203CF1\">good you could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D1\">CLIENT: Okay, so, okay, if I stop self-doubting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D3\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D5\">CLIENT: Arrogance is not going to follow that, is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D7\">THERAPIST: I don't think so. I don't think you've been arrogant in the first 40 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203D9\">CLIENT: No. And I don't...oh Lord. I...oh, I would hate to be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203DB\">THERAPIST: Well why don't we practice and see what happens. I'll let you know if arrogance follows. [Laughter.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203DD\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203DF\">THERAPIST: Why don't we just...your homework assignment, why don't you just enjoy your mind this week. Enjoy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203E1\">CLIENT: I'm going to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203E3\">THERAPIST: Enjoy what it can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203E5\">CLIENT: I've never done that. I'm going to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203E7\">THERAPIST: You should enjoy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203E9\">CLIENT: I am going to do that. I never thought to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, well you should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203ED\">CLIENT: You know it's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203EF\">THERAPIST: Some things that you do you don't really have to work as hard as some other people; and other things you have to work harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203F3\">THERAPIST: Okay, well that goes back to your special gift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203F5\">CLIENT: Hmm. Dog. I never thought of it that way. Okay. That's what I'm going to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203F7\">THERAPIST: So that's your homework; to enjoy your brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. You wouldn't think that somebody would tell you to enjoy your brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203FB\">THERAPIST: Enjoy your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203FD\">CLIENT: Enjoy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N203FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N203FF\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20400\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20401\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm going to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20402\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20403\">THERAPIST: Okay, let me know how that goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20404\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20405\">CLIENT: I will.
