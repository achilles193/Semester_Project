[Pause] I guess I\u2019ve been feeling I guess a little bit more I guess relaxed about work. The experiment that I\u2019ve been working on for a while, we\u2019re taking a pause halfway to kind of make sure, until we get the results back or whatever to come back. So I\u2019m feeling a little more <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">relieved because it took three or four hours a night because I\u2019m in another building and when I came back I kind of felt rushed or I had to do things immediately when I got back to the lab so I\u2019m running there. And, let\u2019s see <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Wait, sorry. I got it about taking you\u2019re feeling a bit more relaxed and waiting on the experiment that you\u2019re doing to get sent back to proceed but what about being in another building for three or four hours?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Oh, I guess the reason I was a kind of stressed a little is the experiment what I was doing is called a sort and it\u2019s on this machine that\u2019s in another building across the street. And so I have to leave the lab for three or four hours and then when I came back I was kind of bombarded in a rush <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">because people wanted to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I see so you don\u2019t have to do anymore of that for a while until you get the data back. Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Right. And, let\u2019s see, yes. [Pause] I guess I\u2019m still pretty annoyed and kind of avoiding Marlowe (ph), I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just, I don\u2019t know. To me I guess he\u2019s just I don\u2019t know I think I\u2019ve built it up in my mind but I can\u2019t trust anything he says and I just don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t know. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">seems insecure so everything he kind of is saying I feel is formed or kind of, what\u2019s the word, premeditated or something, like he\u2019s going to tell a story or something, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">It\u2019s not, I don\u2019t know. I also feel like it\u2019s hard for me to kind of put up with it or kind of listen, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s something about it, about me, I don\u2019t know, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Well I gather it feels, it doesn\u2019t feel genuine. It\u2019s sort of purposeful or in a way manipulated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right but also I think my initial response is to avoid or kind of ignore him or something but then I think I should be nice or I should be, I don\u2019t know, I should talk to him. And then I guess that\u2019s what I I guess I don\u2019t like having to be nice or kind of when I have a sick feeling of, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m blaming him for something or I don\u2019t know. After the e-mail exchange we had two weeks ago about just, I don\u2019t know, I forget what happened but he had gotten mad at me later and then I guess it kind of diffused. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And, I don\u2019t know. But, I\u2019m trying to think, something about I just really don\u2019t want to think about it or deal with it because I\u2019ve had enough and it makes me angry. I don\u2019t know if that means I\u2019m mean or kind of insensitive or something but, yes, I guess for some reason it feels kind of not, not like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">demonesque or not like [a bad way] (ph), but something like hanging out with him kind of distracts me and makes me angry. And I really don\u2019t want to deal with that so I just don\u2019t keep to myself whatever. But I don\u2019t know what it is. Also I think it\u2019s he\u2019s extremely negative and so <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562414\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: He\u2019s extremely negative and then -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh he\u2019s into that, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I kind of, I don\u2019t know. Like the other day we were, I was asking his help, I think it\u2019s was the e-mail on something he worked on. So someone was asking me because it was something he did for the [] and someone (ph) was asking about it. So I said would you just read over my response <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">to make sure it sounds okay? And he said yes, it\u2019s fine. But then he said something like I don\u2019t think anyone could do what, like replicate his project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">He was very negative and so something that we had a project that we want all [] (ph) offices to do and we had kind of piloted it in our labs so he finalized the protocol in front of everyone and wanted everyone to do, but then he says I don\u2019t think this is going to work and all these other things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">It was already set in motion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">I don\u2019t know I guess I got mad at him. I said if we can do it, they can do it. It made me really upset that he was just, I don\u2019t know. Is this going to work? I don\u2019t know so I was just but [pause] anyway <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yes, he reminds me of [inaudible at 00:11:36]; he\u2019s got to tear you down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what it is I guess. [Pause] My first I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being stubborn or something because I don\u2019t want to work on it or kind of it\u2019s not easy so I don\u2019t want to deal with it or, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: You mean, work on the final attendance (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Right, kind of keep trying to sort of in order to make, I don\u2019t know. Thinking it was going to go away or I kind of feel like I\u2019m kind of just I\u2019m by myself and kind of building [inaudible at 00:14:36] against him that are kind of brewing in the ceiling of not trusting him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: I guess that\u2019s a way that hiding your feelings about it separates you from me? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. Maybe the fact that, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of hard for me to describe or I really don\u2019t want to get into it or I don\u2019t want to get angry or, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t think that. [Pause] Maybe, I don\u2019t know, I guess my feeling is that I\u2019ve kind of been stubborn about, I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">just kind of been to myself and kind of doing [inaudible at 00:17:06] like not me or my conflicts I don\u2019t think are going to be easier to me. It\u2019s not pushing myself or kind of, I don\u2019t know, [inaudible at 00:17:31] or something, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I see. If you were pushing yourself or taking chances you would be kind of diving right into talking about it and kind of figure out or something why you\u2019re mad at him in the way that you are and what\u2019s going on with that and that sort of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right. [Pause] I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And that oh, go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Oh no, go ahead. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: That feels, I imagine, sort of as though you may be frustrated with yourself and also feel like you\u2019re letting me down somewhat?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m letting you down I just feel like, I don\u2019t know. Things haven\u2019t really changed and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m being stubborn or kind of the same kind of thought process itself mean to push ourselves. I know the usual things that I do and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">more like it\u2019s easier and more comfortable than doing other things or the other options. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562414\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">I just kind of have a feeling of I\u2019m willing to try different things and kind of I don\u2019t know, kind of [inaudible at 00:21:08] for myself. So I\u2019m not always thinking the same things or kind of going through the same emotional processes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I guess I have a sense that it\u2019s all over the place for you, kind of more actively taking charge of your thoughts and that I think often are the times you don\u2019t say what comes to mind. And I guess that\u2019s typical when it comes to, for example, this with Marlowe (ph) in that you said you always <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">try to go there and at the same time you worry about it and don\u2019t want to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess I was feeling the need of justification of some reason or I guess in this instance kind of being not together (ph) and I always feel that I\u2019m wrong or I\u2019m just being mean or I\u2019m just being or blaming him for something or, I don\u2019t know, or maybe immature or something like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">that. And I guess I can\u2019t, or it feels dangerous or wrong or something or something low, not hatred to spew or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you fear sort of retaliation. I mean mostly I guess in your own head but potentially from someone else as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know I guess it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t think it feels wrong to, I don\u2019t know, chicken out or have these feelings and I don\u2019t know like I\u2019m being immature or something or not play nice or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Almost seems in a way as though you\u2019re feeling as kind of whatever crime you\u2019re committing by being so mad or so critical of him is kind of worse than whatever crime he may have committed that is part of why you feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Right. I guess I\u2019m just kind of like why is it so irksome with him, messy or kind of [inaudible at 00:27:03]. Why do those feelings arise but I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re not closing the blinds. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: No, no, not at all. Sorry. You said on Wednesdays that I haven\u2019t quite caught up on Tuesdays. Better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I guess my theory has been that that anxiety that goes along with something like your anger at Marlowe (ph) sort of in a way puts you in these different parts where you\u2019re worried about how badly it must reflect on you, I mean that\u2019s the part we\u2019re talking about now, to be angry with him <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">the way that you are. It means you\u2019re really immature or mean or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">But I don\u2019t think those sort of very harsh feelings for yourself make the anger or him go away. Could you [inaudible at 00:29:10] equally bad about it but I don\u2019t think they make it less. I think then you kind of, there\u2019s some part of it that feels still very angry at him and critical and the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">part which feels guilty and ashamed for being such a problem for feeling that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">And I think it\u2019s a very disconcerting experience I think, really just feeling that anxiety and parts like that. I think it sucks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m justifying it but just kind of, I don\u2019t know, just looking back at when things were fine with Marlowe (ph) and not spending a lot of time with him, it seemed I was more, yes, consumed by whatever we talked about or just spending time with him that was, it kind of sucked energy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">out of and now kind of having this being annoyed at him or whatever, yes, it masked this [inaudible at 00:31:56] feeling energy or something, like I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t know. Marlowe (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562414\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Sorry, what was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Like I didn\u2019t like doing things on my own or I don\u2019t know. But I didn\u2019t need him or something like that because maybe our relationship kind of seemed like he was always lecturing me or telling me his opinion about things. So it was very like him kind of dominating or something. And he even described <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">it as I\u2019m his little sister or something and which is fine but maybe just the dynamic was kind of heavy and something about proving that I don\u2019t need him or something like that or I\u2019m better alone or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s some way that you felt kind of dominated. I mean in a way sure a big brother little sister relationship could be nice. But it doesn\u2019t sound like, sounds like there was at least an aspect of it that really did not feel nice at all, like you were kind of subject to him or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I think part of it was he has such strong opinions. I mean I just also described his wife as really into yoga and all these things, which is fine. But there\u2019s kind of like an attitude of, I don\u2019t know, especially from him more than her, like elitism or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">And he\u2019s more closed-minded and things like that. So yes, thinking about it kind of felt, I don\u2019t know, heavy or something like that. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And a bit oppressive maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right. And I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s all in my mind. I can\u2019t, for some reason I can\u2019t keep myself separate from it. I allow it to affect me or something. I can\u2019t just say oh that\u2019s how they are, that\u2019s fine, and accept it. It kind of affects me so then it makes me become emotional or something. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I think there\u2019s something charged for you when the relationship feels heavy like that. I mean I guess just sort of in the way you\u2019re describing where, I\u2019m sorry to actually sound like, let\u2019s say he had this ridiculous sense of clothes and wore things that just looked crazy or something like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">that. You\u2019d say okay, whatever, it\u2019s a little goofy but fine it\u2019s there and it\u2019s one piece of who he is and whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">But that\u2019s somehow, what I gather what you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s not like that with this between you and he. You can\u2019t sort of stand outside really very easily.
