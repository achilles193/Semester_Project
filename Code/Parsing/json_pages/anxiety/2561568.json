Sorry. I tend to run so hot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: It gets really cold in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Right. My apartment is like that, too. How\u2019s it going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I had a funny experience yesterday that I thought was really symbolic of a lot of things. I had a date and before the date I was online. I was eating a sandwich and I saw some article this guy had written. He asked four girls that he had gone out with why they weren\u2019t interested in him. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">so weird. It was so weird how things trigger just that little thing.  It totally triggered \u2013 I suddenly became superstitious that I shouldn\u2019t read that because I have those \u2013 I don\u2019t know what. He had those feelings of do they really like me? Do they not like me? Why do they like me? So I read it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">I didn\u2019t even really relate to the guy, but there was something about it that made me anxious a little bit. It was really funny and then right after I read that I felt like things \u2013 it\u2019s just a shitty part of being an over-thinker. Little things went wrong, like when you\u2019re going to a phase where you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">feel like you\u2019re dropping everything. I started connecting all of that to \u2013 I don\u2019t know what. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: To some feeling that . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Feelings of inadequacy or there\u2019s something wrong with me. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know because I don\u2019t really feel that way anymore, but this thing triggered it for some reason. So here\u2019s the funny part \u2013 so then I get there and then I was fine. I wasn\u2019t being all nervous; I was just being <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">me. I forgot about that. I get there and this girl was fucking all over me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a date where a girl is pretty aggressive right off the bat in this way. It was just funny. It was just, to me, such a poignant reminder that here is this girl who keeps telling me that I\u2019m so cute and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">whatever \u2013 all this shit \u2013 and all these complements and everything and is very sweet. It felt good to be able to take that, really take it.  I wasn\u2019t saying thank you but feeling like I\u2019m not cute or something, but still it was weird that \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It was just a poignant thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: She was all over you, not just physically, you\u2019re saying with her complementing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, a lot of it was physical, but no \u2013 she really liked me. Whatever. All that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: She was just like \u201cwhat are you doing to me?\u201d (pause) I don\u2019t know. \u201cI just want to sit here and stare at your face.\u201d I don\u2019t know. Things like that. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet. You seem like you\u2019re actually a really nice guy.\u201d Things like that, so it wasn\u2019t just a hook-up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I [think you were saying first] (ph?). It sounded really much more [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:04).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I think so, because later she was like, \u201cAre you sure you like me?\u201d I don\u2019t know. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t do this all the time. This is kind of crazy.\u201d She came home with me. Whether she does; who knows? To me (chuckles) it was just poignant that it was so night and day. Yeah. I can\u2019t think of a . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Disparity between [what you were feeling.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And it was almost like a melancholy, poignant \u2013 like wow, man. Years and years and years of the reality in your head not being the reality that\u2019s outside your head.  And then another few years of getting it, but having to fake it. That\u2019s what we talked about. \u201cYou said that you used to be criminally <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">shy. You\u2019re totally obviously not shy now.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, there were years of hard work. There were some good things that happened and some bad things.\u201d Being in a band, being a poet, those are all good ways to get . . . but your parent dies and that\u2019s a rough way to stop being . . . because they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">force you to . . . or at least with me. It was just \u2013 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561568\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Not to mention being here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Well, I didn\u2019t get into that with her, but yeah. (pause)  It was just very interesting. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Tell me more about the feelings that come up. It sounds like you\u2019re not necessarily identifying with the exact feelings right when it\u2019s happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: No. My past self \u2013 but that\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s the poignant part of this. Why am I even reading them? Because that isn\u2019t my track record. What girls have not wanted to . . . Well, Samantha? I don\u2019t know. Do you know what I mean? Any girl I\u2019ve gone on dates with, I don\u2019t remember any that \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">you know. Maybe more recently with this \u201cokay, stupid\u201d thing, but that\u2019s so . . . nothing is invested in that. I\u2019m not invested in it. So, of course, it\u2019s the fucking Internet. You meet someone \u2013 ahhh, it\u2019s whatever; and either they\u2019re kind of whatever or you\u2019re not . . .  But girls that I\u2019ve really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">gone on several dates with, that\u2019s never . . . Do you know what I mean? Even that, even the fact that I would read that article says more about this bizarre thing that is like what am I identifying with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s for us to get to know. I think you\u2019ve done all the CBT you can do to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: The what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: CBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: The yogurt place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: No, cognitive behavioral therapy. In other words, telling yourself how to think differently about it; reminding yourself how irrational it is. You\u2019ve had that happen over and over and over again where you just get this data that it\u2019s irrational, that\u2019s not what\u2019s actually happening, but it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">doesn\u2019t touch it \u2013 the feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Doesn\u2019t touch . . ? That was the thing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That\u2019s why this was weird because for some reason it triggered something, but then it didn\u2019t. Do you know what I mean? In other words, I didn\u2019t carry that with me the rest of the night. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Into the date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. In other words, it didn\u2019t really affect me. It was more intellectual, ultimately. Initially it triggered a little bit but as soon as I kind of went \u201chmm,\u201d then I think it was more like a slight worry. As soon as I hit the road and I got there \u2013 but I know what you mean. That\u2019s the poignant <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">part is that I remembered that that\u2019s what it used to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re saying that it didn\u2019t, then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Hell, no. No, no. That\u2019s why it\u2019s poignant, right? It\u2019s poignant because I\u2019m observing it and it\u2019s like a sad scene from a movie. The same thing with the heart attack thing. I couldn\u2019t say it; I didn\u2019t want to hear it. One of my favorite episodes of The Office is the one where (chuckles) Dwight <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">does a fake fire drill and Stanley has a heart attack.  I watch it over and over and it doesn\u2019t give me anxiety, but that\u2019s all relatively recent in the last year or two. It\u2019s gotten better and better and better, but it\u2019s really in the last year or two where it\u2019s totally where I don\u2019t even think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">it. So yeah, that was interesting. (pause) And also because with this girl \u2013 I like her. It was really fun. I think she\u2019s really cool, but I can go either way. That feels good, too, in a way. She\u2019s nice. I guess I\u2019ll see her again. Whatever.

It took me so long to share my music with people, be more serious about poetry, things that I was doing seriously, but just not in an actionable way in the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Just sharing your full self with a person instead of being so shy \u2013 you said \u201ccriminally shy\u201d \u2013 to actually be more of yourself and she still likes you. (pause) Maybe not even being Don Juan last night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Don Juan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Seductive.

No. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: But you haven\u2019t talked about it explicitly \u2013 the step of actually not having to do that anymore and she\u2019s still interested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I was overplaying that in the past. Don Juan. I don\u2019t know if I was doing that. I think what I was doing was I was being myself, but I had to force myself to be myself. I didn\u2019t do anything different last night that I wouldn\u2019t do six years ago. I really didn\u2019t. There was always <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">\u201coh, you seem so calm\u201d and \u201cyou know a lot of people.\u201d Whatever. Whatever skills I have, I had; but I had to force myself to be myself. I had to coach myself to be calm. Don\u2019t be anxious. It was work. It was a lot of work, so in that way it felt kind of fake. But yeah, it wasn\u2019t like I had different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">lines that I used. I was just doing what I do now. (chuckles) It was just much harder because I seemed relaxed, but I wasn\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s what made it feel like you were turning something on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: But not that it was inauthentic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: No. I never did things that were. I knew enough to know that that\u2019s not going to work. I know that, but it still feels inauthentic if you feel like you\u2019re just forcing yourself and you feel nervous. You\u2019re being you, but obviously the person doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re more insecure or you\u2019re this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">or you\u2019re that. I think maybe the other part that it wasn\u2019t me, but the people I would go after. It seemed a little bit like . . . I guess it\u2019s like that now, too. Obviously, you\u2019re initially attracted to the way someone looks, but I am more open-minded now about appearance.  This girl wasn\u2019t stunning. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">She\u2019s pretty, like her fashion sense and something about her that\u2019s alluring. It\u2019s a little bit of that stuff, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I think when I say Don Juan, it sort of picking up on this \u2013 and maybe we never quite put this in this way and you may not feel like it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s always sounded like years ago it was compensation for having then felt really insecure deep down inside; it was a kind of bravado and cockiness <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">sometimes in some circumstances. It\u2019s different than internally just having confidence, like the bravado that covers up an insecurity. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561568\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: But the funny thing is that bravado really, in the big picture, really isn\u2019t bravado. In other words, for me that\u2019s bravado, but really just talking to someone and having \u2013 do you know what I mean? But yes, I know what you mean. I would force myself to somehow talk to that girl. I would somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">find a way. Yeah, I don\u2019t do that anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: But it wouldn\u2019t feel like just muscling your way through there.

What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: What are you talking about? Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: You would come in a lot of times saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what I did last night,\u201d like how you engaged with someone and slipped her your number.  Even while feeling these other things, it didn\u2019t have the feeling of you were just muscling, trying to actually have an ordinary conversation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">It felt sort of like over-the-top conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.

I don\u2019t know what seductive things, but yeah, that part felt great because that\u2019s the part that\u2019s, again, all from my dad\u2019s side and my grandpa. Life is absurd. If I think someone is beautiful, it feels good to somehow muster the courage that \u201cLook, here\u2019s my number. I think you\u2019re stunning.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">I think it\u2019s more the conversation. That part is almost like high school, almost like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to fucking do it. I\u2019m going to ask this girl to dance with me and I\u2019m going to look her in the eye.\u201d It was more like after that, when she starts talking and we\u2019re talking, that\u2019s the part, to me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">that\u2019s the fake; that\u2019s the important stuff. The other stuff I feel like was just daring myself to be like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just not going to be scared of these fucking people.\u201d It\u2019s that \u2013 I don\u2019t know.  Do you know what I mean? To me, it\u2019s the conversation when you get into like, \u201cSo, what\u2019s up? What <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200713\">do you do?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Then it would be having to kind of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Because then I say real things, right? Am I a poet? I would feel weird. I would feel nervous saying \u2013 I didn\u2019t say I was an artist. I would always circle around it; \u201cI\u2019m a grad student.\u201d Everything was just labored. They didn\u2019t know that, but it was fucking exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: So maybe all of it, even being brave in a bar \u2013 if you want to call it brave instead of bravado \u2013 could feel that it just comes from a different place, as does the conversation. It\u2019s coming more from [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:00).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I had bravado last night. Once I feel comfortable or I feel that chemistry, within appropriateness and whatever, obviously, you have to feel something to take that dare. That\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of fun. You\u2019re taking a bit of a risk, but now I don\u2019t really think; there is no thought, really. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">just either feels right or it doesn\u2019t and I don\u2019t dwell on it either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Did you tell her you\u2019re an artist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. For the last year or two I\u2019ve been \u2013 yeah. I don\u2019t make qualms anymore. I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, I went to Harvard.\u201d I don\u2019t feel weird about it. You seem douchier if you do. I\u2019ve even overheard people say that. They don\u2019t like it when people way later slip it in that they went to Harvard.  That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">where you went to school. Don\u2019t try to act like \u2013 do you know what I mean? Just say what it is. Yeah, I was like, \u201cMy book came out.\u201d Whatever.

So . . . (pause) I don\u2019t know. (pause) The only thing that I think is tricky is that I do worry that I\u2019ve lost the ability \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I ever had the ability \u2013 to decide.  I can\u2019t decide like, \u201cThis girl. I\u2019m going to date this girl.\u201d I\u2019ve realized I don\u2019t have that. I\u2019m becoming <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">okay with not having that ability, but that\u2019s the problem with if you bloom late in life then you\u2019re constantly like shit. I want to experience more things. Then that possibility problem is like well, damn. That means I could really probably find the kind of girl that I want. That\u2019s the only thing I don\u2019t like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: I think when you\u2019re talking about difficulty deciding, it relates even more to where you don\u2019t yet feel like you know yourself well enough; like it\u2019s not coming yet from a place all the time where it\u2019s just trusting.  Like if you\u2019re feeling like you want to date this person, then you do; <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">and if you don\u2019t think that you don\u2019t, then you don\u2019t.

Now I\u2019m the opposite. Now I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m confused. It\u2019s like yeah, I should date this girl. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. If a part of me says, \u201cI like her but I don\u2019t know if this is going to be a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">long-term thing,\u201d a part of me will say, \u201cIs that because you still have these idealized \u2013 you don\u2019t want a Samantha-type whack job.\u201d That\u2019s the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: Is it that or is it that you really realize that this is not someone who you would fall in love with? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Right. I can\u2019t tell. Yeah, I can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s happening everywhere, right? Even Assyria is that idea and idealization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: But that doesn\u2019t feel like this, though. This feels more like I\u2019ve got that under control because I see that. I\u2019m like yeah, I\u2019m not going to get there and things are going to be . . . But when it\u2019s a human being, you\u2019re talking about intimacy and dating and effort and energy. Then you might <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">hurt them or whatever. I don\u2019t know. When it\u2019s just you deciding whether you take this job or that job, you can think that out and that\u2019s a little different; but with dating that\u2019s one place where, because of all this stuff, even though now I feel great \u2013 let\u2019s say on a date \u2013 then I can\u2019t quite . . <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">. Do you know what I mean?  It\u2019s like this is great, but . . . I don\u2019t know how to explain it.

I don\u2019t trust my own what kind of woman I want or whatever. I don\u2019t trust that because I don\u2019t know if that exists. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing the same old thing, but now in a different way that I think is healthy but is really just the same. When I think of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">the kind of woman that I really, really would want, that\u2019s hard to find \u2013 a woman that\u2019s cosmopolitan, maybe has an EU passport but is also pretty American. (chuckles) That\u2019s a tall order. That\u2019s not easy to find and it\u2019s certainly not easy to find in Darien, so really then what am I . . . ?

Because everything else is coming together, I want to give myself time in this phase. (pause) Exactly because of that \u2013 that I don\u2019t quite trust, now that I have a better idea of the kind of person that I would really think about getting really serious with, I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">just jump into something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Any old relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t date; also I think you\u2019re still working on why that person is [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:08). You\u2019ve been saying a lot lately that \u201cwhenever I\u2019m [ ] I\u2019m thinking why am I relating to this?\u201d Like going to San Diego for that wedding. You were going out to San Diego and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">you decided not to go that weekend. I think it\u2019s like this is the next direction, thinking why did you even go on a date last night? Why did you go back to your place? Why haven\u2019t you called her yet? Why have you not called her yet? Why is it that woman? It\u2019s a little uncertain what the real motivations are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: It\u2019s always a little uncertain what people\u2019s motivations are, though.

Yeah.

That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. I worry, but that sounds kind of like an idealized kind of . . . That\u2019s not an easy type of person to find.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Is someone like [Julia?] Is that kind of . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yes, exactly. Someone like Julia, except not Julia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: What do you mean? Except more or less what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: She was so reserved. Sex was weird for her. She didn\u2019t have a ton of issues, but she was a little too dramatic. It was hard to have a real deep conversation. It was hard for her. She was just a little too stoic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re wanting someone who can make real emotional contact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. What the fuck is the point? Otherwise I could just sleep around or just go on dates. If I\u2019m going to spend my time without feeling like I\u2019m wasting my time on a relationship, it\u2019s got to be a much deeper connection. Everything else about her was perfect. She lives in Berlin and has this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">wonderful little family in this beautiful town in Germany. Their lifestyle \u2013 just everything \u2013 I love that; but it\u2019s got to be someone that\u2019s not going to be weird about sex or just be able to have really deep conversations.  The other thing I didn\u2019t like about her was that she would often be a contrarian. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B92\">I do not fucking like that. I\u2019m an intense person. I have opinions. I fucking love to judge. You can\u2019t take that too seriously. For me it\u2019s just a pastime and it\u2019s a hobby and it\u2019s funny a lot of times. Other times I am intense. I have strong feelings so I don\u2019t like it if someone immediately says the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B93\">opposite. You\u2019ve got to engage and just talk because I don\u2019t do that. I just kind of listen and I\u2019ll jokingly maybe disagree or I\u2019ll just \u2013 whatever.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Than with Julia. Would it work for you now with her [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:10)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: Who knows what would happen now? With her, I think the only thing that happened was I too quickly confessed my love for her and all that shit. I was already in a bad place, so I think \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say I was needy because that\u2019s not fair to me. I don\u2019t think I was being \u2013 but yeah, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C11\">in a tough place. That never came up, that it was kind of casual. She was my girlfriend, so that\u2019s what you do \u2013 at least I do.  In a weird way we did, but her problem was she then totally pulled back and just closed down and whatever happened. Before that, it was way more. I felt a great connection for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Contact. In other words, deep emotional conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. We really . . . But I think that was the problem. I think it just freaked her out. Maybe she thought we were just going to be hook-up friends. Who knows? Because we hooked up the first date. She took me back to her place, so maybe in her mind it was never going to be as serious as <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">it was to me; but she kind of went with it because she was into it but then she wasn\u2019t. Do you know what I mean?  We were both, I think, not in the right place and she just handled it worse than I did. That\u2019s the only difference. I would have at least, as hurt as I was, if she continued to talk to me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C52\">that would have been a little different, but it was just so shitty the way that it happened. I was going through such a tough time that this one lifeline was just gone, so it was just bad. (pause) I think the real question is: is the girl that I\u2019m now thinking of, have I concocted this thing because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C53\">it\u2019s difficult? I\u2019ll either never find that or . . . Do you know what I mean? That\u2019s my pattern, clearly. I never commit to anything and the one or two times I want to, there are a million red flags saying that you shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m becoming okay with. Maybe I just don\u2019t want to right <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C54\">now. Maybe I like being alone most of the time and I just, once in a while, want to hang out with somebody. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Like maybe you don\u2019t want to get married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Right now, at least, maybe. It has to be someone that just so blows me away, but usually I\u2019m just like okay. This is really fun, but now I\u2019m ready to be home alone with the cat and I\u2019m just comfortable.

That\u2019s what I\u2019m totally saying. That\u2019s the sad part now. I see that. Of course, yes, it is about her, but I totally made it about me. I allowed those stupid voices, instead of stopping and saying, \u201cWait a second. No woman or man is going to fucking uproot themselves and come <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E91\">to this fucking God-forsaking, drizzled, grey hell because they\u2019re not attracted to you.\u201d  It makes me cringe when I think of it now. It\u2019s ridiculous. (pause) That one really hurts. That one, it\u2019s hard. That\u2019s a tough one. I think of all of them, the Meredith one is going to be one of those regrets <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E92\">that I just have and I just have to deal with it, because she was great. She was a really cool person. There were issues, but again what I\u2019m saying is that if I had handled it differently, maybe it still wouldn\u2019t have worked out, but it would have not worked out in a more . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a different path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: A different pathway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: [Because with her anorexia. There is no sex drive with anorexia.

I wasn\u2019t there for her. Obviously, that\u2019s a serious thing. I thought I was being there for her, but I wasn\u2019t.  That one just fucking sucks. It just sucks. (pause) That\u2019s almost where I try not to even think about it. It drives me crazy because, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F11\">really, she was perfect. It\u2019s hard for me to take that. She was young and gorgeous and amazing. She was amazing. Yeah, she had fucking flaws, but we all do. Her flaws, obviously, didn\u2019t stop her from totally committing and wanting to get married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s married now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">CLIENT: She has a kid, yeah.  (chuckles) That part was also hurtful, but yeah. (pause) That is one thing that I was like maybe it wasn\u2019t going to work out because that happened so quickly after we broke up. To get pregnant so quickly after a break-up, that is odd to me because that\u2019s a very serious <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F51\">thing. That still makes me pause for a little bit. Regardless, that has nothing to do with it. It just was a totally mishandled . . .
