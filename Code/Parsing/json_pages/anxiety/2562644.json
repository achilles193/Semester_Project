I got your message.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Sorry, I was (inaudible at 00:06:13) on the way here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I was just delayed on the way. (pause) I guess on the way, like I was just thinking I was talking about how I\u2019m so I got my period yesterday and I realized that for a few years beforehand I\u2019ve been feeling unusually low; just unhappy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And I\u2019ve been (pause) you know I guess I\u2019ve been dealing with sort of other things that I always have to start (inaudible at 00:07:44) extra time at night, so I was a little bit more sleep deprived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Then I thought about that for a bit but it didn\u2019t really make sense because sometimes that happens and it doesn\u2019t bother me so much, or at least not to that degree. But I was feeling more tired than not warranted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">And we have guests staying with us for the weekend Cadence and Erica; Karl\u2019s brother and his wife. But I really like them and I mean it was it\u2019s always a little bit fretful having somebody in the house, but (inaudible at 00:08:23).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">I mean there were still things with that. Like I realized that I was like that since basically since Kathleen had called, I know that I\u2019ve been worried about what she could have been saying to other people I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">And I you know, not that I (pause) (inaudible at 00:08:58) speaking, I know that Cadence had certainly, and pretty much Erica had I knew they liked me. I know that they like me, but it was still I just about I just felt sort of an uneasiness about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And eventually we talked with them a little bit about what had been going on and (pause) it just sort of ended with, well if you figure out how to deal with that, let us know because we\u2019d like to do that too. They\u2019re having the same type of issue. Once I think about it, it\u2019s not so surprising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I guess (inaudible at 00:09:49) more than the sum of these parts I just felt. We were really (inaudible at 00:10:01) for no good reason. And like yesterday I did student feedback and in my section. I wanted to do this with both of my sections. I have one on Monday and one on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">And I\u2019d been thinking about some changes I wanted to put in place in my Monday section (inaudible at 00:10:30) incredibly no motivation. It\u2019s funny, you know, you get these sort of random assortments into groups and my Wednesday they have the same lessons on the same ideas about my Wednesday group. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">I pretty much in and throw it out the window and say okay you guys talk, and they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">In my Monday group I follow it to the best of my ability and it\u2019s still they\u2019re just waiting for me to learn from them effectively. So I\u2019ve been thinking about changes to put in place anyway, and I wanted to hear mostly what the you know, I wanted to hear what they were thinking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">And I knew that I was to expect certain variations and views because they\u2019re the ones who I\u2019ve seen all of their work, but they do by now. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">And the other thing is it\u2019s not, you know, in asking for feedback, I was jetting on, I knew (pause) quit while I was going to out switch read it. And I knew some of the things I was going to get already and I did that and I put the changes in place that I wanted; that I expected. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562644\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">I expected to hear that and I had a plan to deal with it, but it (pause) what I wasn\u2019t really expecting is, it\u2019s not the sort of thing I would normally take personally. I know it\u2019s about what\u2019s going on in the classroom, and I know perfectly well that like as I said, I know these things by now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">So I know which one would say that really do have to go over everything that\u2019s on the Web site. I can look on the course Web site. I can see that you really need to. And I know which one is the important for the three who are saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really great when you go over the X, Y, and Z that are on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">course Web site.\u201d And I don\u2019t know what to expect that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">But I was sort of internally flipping out like (pause) on the other hand part of me was just shrieking and screaming, what do they expect from me? Am I supposed to be like am I, you know, supposed to be like, you know the stories and trying to figure out to handle all of these different views. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">And then on the other hand, you\u2019re such a crappy teacher. How like you really should just hand in your resignation and walk out of the door right now. And the thing is that\u2019s none of that is like you know like normally I would have been showing those opinions to Karl and laughing over it, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">instead of then he wandered over to take a look. I was shrieking at him not to look because does he want to see everybody being so critical of me? Does he get pleasure out of it? And I was like what is with me, you know? [Crying] Sorry, this is [Crying] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(pause) He has none. Always when I woke up this morning and realized that I had my period I\u2019m sorry; bringing in the gross details, or at least\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Feel free to tell me whatever you need to tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Sorry, I know it\u2019s just me. I hate bodily fluid stuff. But I\u2019ve always had really, really heavy periods when I was a kid and very painful. And I don\u2019t really know why it took so long to realize that I just had to take the doctor\u2019s advice and go on the pill. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I had a really unsympathetic doctor at that point. It probably didn\u2019t help that she wasn\u2019t the best at dealing with that sort of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">When I did thought it took like all of a month or two for everything to calm down. They were shorter, more manageable. The other thing was though that I had a lot less I also had I don\u2019t know whether it was with the pain or with what, but I did tend to get that was the period when I had the sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">of heaviest anxiety also. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">And I had no idea what it was at that time and, thanks to the unsympathetic doctor, she sent whole rashes of tests about nuclear lung scans and stuff, but couldn\u2019t recognize the symptoms of an anxiety attack and help me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">So I don\u2019t really think that the unclear lung scan and things were really helping the anxiety either. But I think that the thing is they did tend to go hand-in-hand to an extent, probably because I don\u2019t really know, but I think it probably didn\u2019t help with the really, really painful crap that in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">fear of it. I don\u2019t know, it couldn\u2019t have been helpful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And I\u2019m so (inaudible at 00:17:04). The thing is I haven\u2019t had this since I guess I was, you know, maybe I never really liked getting my period or anything. I don\u2019t know many people who find it pleasurable. Not that I\u2019ve asked.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562644\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">But this is the second time that it\u2019s happened basically since I\u2019ve since my breast feeding has slowed down a bit and my period has come back. And I\u2019m on the mini pill, but it\u2019s not the same. And so my periods are more regular. They\u2019re heavier again. Much heavier; that\u2019s why I\u2019m late. I had to stop on the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">And (pause) I feel like I\u2019m sort of back to the same place emotionally. The thing I sort of thought it was my imagination, but this is the second time it\u2019s happened now, since I\u2019m at the place where I could just I was feeling happy and then for no good reason; nothing happened. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">All of a sudden it just sort of, I slipped into this huge emotional dip. I don\u2019t know. I mean I (pause) could be making it up, but it does sort of connect back to where I was before I went on well beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Beforehand and dating to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: High school. It was (pause) I can\u2019t remember whether it was grade 11 or 12, but I went on the pill in the first place, and I was very nervous about it. I\u2019m not really sure what I thought would happen, but I think it was because it was a birth control pill and I thought that somehow it meant <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">that I was somehow having sex even when I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend or anything, right. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">Just the word association made me feel like (pause) everyone thought I was crazy. Everybody thought I was crazy, but it just felt so shy of it. (pause) That\u2019s just it. It\u2019s just this emotional thing like it makes everything more difficult to handle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">Like I had these plans in place for dealing with, you know, what needs the (ph). I hate that word. It was like I was working the whole time, but I used it to in part to think about this Monday group and how I could change things and develop a way of, you know, it\u2019s a little bit more work for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">develop two parallel plans for two sections. But you know there\u2019s no point in teaching unless they\u2019re the same, but they\u2019re not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">And I was trying to develop that and ways to deal with it. (pause) Then all of a sudden yesterday it was just like it was this, I\u2019m such a terrible teacher and I\u2019m, you know, the one who\u2019s holding these kids back. And at the same time, but what can they possibly expect from me. Am I supposed to be able <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">to learn for them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">Listening to my brain I felt like I was a terrible, terrible bitch. It was I was like dealing with having a stereotypical adolescent in my head. And it helped so far from I mean it was me but it felt so far from me, like just (pause) in a way it felt like (pause) in some ways I mean, differences <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">and similarities of course. But so much it felt like listening to Laura talking about her jobs and her work and things like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">Where normally I\u2019m the one listening to her and thinking, you know, there are going to be difficulties. In every job you have to learn how to deal with them and make the best. Or I don\u2019t really know why she took the job that she has right now when she knows that she would be working for somebody who <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">she really doesn\u2019t respect, and you should have some measure of respect for your boss or people that you\u2019re working with to think it\u2019s so much (unintelligible) so much easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562644\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">Like I don\u2019t necessarily agree with my professor I\u2019m working with right now, but I have but I can work with him in a very respectful way. I don\u2019t like his cynicism about it but I understand how it came about and I (pause) I have a basic measure of respect in working with him.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">When I\u2019m listening to her talk about her work it\u2019s very often just first she says it\u2019s all fine and she likes it and then she goes off and sort of complains about that his person and that person and the way they act and the way this person acts and how especially how he expects me to do these sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">of menial sorts of jobs and things after him. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">And that\u2019s sort of how what it\u2019s like listening to him now because usually when even when I like I mean sure I talk about the students that (pause) normally have a sense of humor. I thinks that the difference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">I normally have a sense of humor about what\u2019s going on and I think it\u2019s kind of, you know, you\u2019ve just got to laugh when somebody writes to you to ask you before, like where in the introduction to like [Crying] in the book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: In the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: At the epilogue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: [Crying] I was sort of just remembering about that e-mail and I was laughing and (inaudible at 00:25:46) about how can I can I write something bad and turn to Page 8? [Laughing] What am I supposed to do here? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">But this morning I had gotten an e-mail from a student asking about his mid-term grade and I was staring at this one line e-mail for and I had told them I was going to be getting them their exams back tomorrow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">I was staring at this one line e-mail like practically going like this. (pause) I can\u2019t tell from the tone of the e-mail because it\u2019s right and left and it seemed snarky to me. He\u2019s being [Crying] relax right back. Sorry, I\u2019ve got to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">But alternatively, I\u2019ll be handing the exams back tomorrow, wait that long or whatever. It doesn\u2019t really matter but (pause) it\u2019s just this. It\u2019s like somebody took a slipshod on me and turned it from reasonably cheerful and gradual sense of humor to emotional, practically difficult with a tendency <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">to break down in tears every five minutes. Like do you know? 00:27:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: I mean I don\u2019t know much about the (inaudible at 00:27:27) of these things. Do you know when your period comes back again if there\u2019s sort of a hormonal surge or some sort of hormonal shift? I would imagine there is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I think there is. I know so little about it. I\u2019m not as bad as a bunch would probably know more actually about the science behind it since that\u2019s what my husband does right now because I know as much about science as about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">I think there is. I mean there is there\u2019s a hormonal change of some kind that goes on, but I don\u2019t know whether what it does or how or anything like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m saying that in part because I don\u2019t want you to be alarmed. It sounds like you\u2019re like oh, my gosh, I feel like my personality has changed overnight and not for the better. And I sort of you know clearly forgetting your period back there is some sort of emotion. I really don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">know much about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">But I\u2019m imagining that that\u2019s a big piece of it and it may be at some point that you want to go back on the pill too. But I kind of want to just delay your anxiety like it\u2019s okay. You know you\u2019re having some sort of physiologic shift. It\u2019s going to be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562644\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been sort of (pause) you know on the one hand I\u2019ve been trying to tell myself that like it\u2019s (pause) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just taking something to control the hormones, also control that, then that\u2019s probably what\u2019s going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">I think (inaudible at 00:29:22). You know my tendency to sort of look at everything too much, that sort of brings back the hamlet line of thinking too precisely on the event. It\u2019s like (pause)\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s not like you\u2019re looking at it too much it\u2019s that you\u2019re worrying. You\u2019re very worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s like part of it is, is it me or is it just like, you know, when you pick back the scab that\u2019s what\u2019s really there, or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: You do have this fear that, you know, pulling back a few layers and there\u2019s going to be like there\u2019s this crazy person there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: And when you\u2019re not feeling good or right it\u2019s like you\u2019re just that feeling intensifies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was reading (pause) and I don\u2019t get a chance, it\u2019s funny, I guess I\u2019m an academic who reads. I don\u2019t get a chance to read very much. But (pause) it\u2019s a very few people I read who write today. One mostly writes in the niche field of knitting humor, but she just came out with a book that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200891\">only mentions knitting a few times instead of being knitting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">And what I\u2019ve heard, a little essay in there was struck me was about how she was she\u2019s a humor writer so it was funny. But she was writing about how she was feeling terribly low and down about how her I don\u2019t remember what exactly one of her halfway funny lines was specifically when she told her <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">husband before she went to bed that she would understand if he left her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">And then she woke up the next morning with this terrible, terrible cold or the flu or whatever and she said to him, you suddenly recognizing that this happens when it\u2019s like when her one of her symptoms of getting sick is that she gets really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">And I read that and thought, on the one hand it\u2019s sort of like she wrote, it was like honey I say, but there\u2019s sort of somewhat prickled the mind when she said that. And I also did sort of where this kind of (pause) when something does sort of kick me in a way, it just reminded me. It sort of felt similar, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">this kind of (pause) falling to pieces when one it feels like when one thing kicks me I sort of feel like well I can\u2019t keep everything. I can\u2019t keep one thing together so I can\u2019t keep everything together. I can\u2019t keep anything together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">What use am I? I might as well throw in the towel or just (pause) should go and sign to some monastery on the top of a mountain because they would all be better off without me down here. Oh woe is me. It\u2019s like yes, it\u2019s kind of (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Where\u2019d you go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: I was just thinking about how (pause) I was just sort of trailing through other times when I\u2019ve been either (pause) some kind of (pause) mostly I was thinking about when I gave birth to Genevieve how (pause) after that when I was staying and I was so (pause) I guess in a way I\u2019m sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">still puzzling over how I didn\u2019t react to it at the time. How I didn\u2019t do anything about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562644\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">(pause) Sort of thinking about my (pause) the times you know, when I came back from the hospital I was feeling reasonably secure after going in, you know, this new person had come out of feel like after her. And it was feeling reasonably secure. I didn\u2019t take very long at all to sort of match me over <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">into insecurity about it, and feeling that oh well, then I guess I can\u2019t really do anything at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">And (pause) I was remembering when we talked to our rabbi about it, one of the things he said then was the mention of hormones was that he said, you know there\u2019s a lot of hormonal issues that are going on also right now, and you don\u2019t want to mess that or play with that. That can have effects also. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">And so you need your space while you\u2019re sorting things out like that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">I\u2019m not saying that like there\u2019s nothing going on otherwise or whatever, but it was just no wonder with me being hard on myself sometimes because things that (pause) I wonder sometimes if I have a tendency to tell myself, well it\u2019s just feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">When first of all I don\u2019t think there is such a thing as just feelings. And second of all of maybe there are other factors at play also and calling those just feelings when it\u2019s stuff that\u2019s physiological that maybe that pushes it more into the realm of just feelings and then I get messed up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">It sort of reminds me of moments when I was saying that I know it\u2019s just feelings. Well it\u2019s just about feelings; that\u2019s what it is. As I was talking about how I don\u2019t really like he works in the performing arts and he\u2019d been sent on a site visit to review some piece of performance art where a woman <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F1\">was describing a woman who was pumping on stage pumping milk and thinking about, you know, he has two daughters right now and they pump and that seemed to sort of (pause) weird and wasteful when it\u2019s part of the very real nutrition process for infants. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">And I was saying it struck me kind of, from what he was describing, was kind of strange. I really don\u2019t say how I really don\u2019t like pumping because it\u2019s (pause) feels so strange when I\u2019m pumping and Genevieve is right there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">Just I, you know, when Genevieve is right there I sort of have to have somebody else around because I am pumping, felt that she should be eating, you know, the way it feels to me, she should be eating as I\u2019m pumping it, and I can\u2019t pick her up if she\u2019s crying, or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">It\u2019s an uncomfortable experience for me. And I know that, you know, the food is going to her anyway and so it\u2019s just, you know, it\u2019s this feeling that you get. And like this (pause) that\u2019s what it all is with the way these things work. You\u2019re supposed to feel like the milk is supposed to go to her because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">that\u2019s what lactation is. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Well the problem for you sometime is the conclusions that you draw from the feelings you\u2019re having like oh, I must be crazy. The one like Kathleen, the one like Laura; that you don\u2019t allow yourself the feels that you start to judge them and put them in categories, and usually not very favorable <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A71\">ones at that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) You know it reminds of (pause) I was with her once in the grocery store and she was acting sort of very chipper. And she asked me, am I acting unnaturally chipper, because I\u2019m trying to make because I don\u2019t feel happy and I\u2019m trying to make myself be happy by acting happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562644\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">And it was like just sort of felt very weird to me. (pause) And, but what\u2019s going on with her and what sometimes goes on with me is that it definitely, definitely goes on with Leah, I think it does go with me (inaudible at 00:44:28) is this (pause). You know, that you\u2019re not really supposed to have bad feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">But if you\u2019re just in a crappy mood one day then well you really should be you should sort of (pause) if you have the bad feelings then it\u2019s the bad characteristics, then you\u2019ve got these bad characteristics in you.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s not a good way to think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Where do you think the two of you get that from; those thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: (pause) I don\u2019t know. I think wanting to send them to me and I think I kind of get it from Leah because we\u2019re definitely I mean I definitely (pause) have we\u2019re very close to stressing she\u2019s definitely more active of the two of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Dominant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: Dominant [Laughing]. And I talked a lot about everything and, you know, so (pause) I\u2019ve always had lots of (pause) I mean thinking just very recently, before we had our kids, she all of a sudden felt like she I think it\u2019s a very common and I\u2019ve noticed it in a lot of my friends. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B91\">I\u2019ve been meeting for ages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">But I had two friends who took up knitting while they were pregnant. Like I think there\u2019s something in me. I was like oh, I\u2019m making something. It\u2019s kind of nice. Maybe I should make other things learn how to make other things too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">With her it wasn\u2019t that, it was I have to be betted domestically. I want to be able to, you know so I feel it\u2019s the word shrimp that comes up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Typical.

It\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going to be okay. You\u2019re having a tough day. You\u2019re having a tough week. I imagine there\u2019s something hormonal. And like I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I might Google it and find out when you get your period back after, you know, being pregnant, whether <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C71\">there\u2019s I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s not a shift in hormones. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">And if you really want to sort of just touch base with; call your OB GYN. I\u2019m imagining that\u2019s you know your feelings that are real that I want to talk with you about, but imagine the intensity right now is because of that shift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">You know, you\u2019re going to be just fine.
