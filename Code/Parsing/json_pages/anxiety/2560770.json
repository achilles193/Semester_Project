I\u2019ve been kept busier with those two things and then, on the flip side, there\u2019s not too much to report with progress in the university side of things since their application process for this year is still kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">of in an infancy. They\u2019re not doing too much with regards to planning, student allocation of where you\u2019ll be or anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve already applied for that and just haven\u2019t heard?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: It hasn\u2019t even opened up. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve even started accepting people who applied this time around yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Are you getting a little nervous about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: No. I would just say I want to kind of get on with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Impatient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m chomping at the bit to get on with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Is that how you\u2019re feeling about going to school in general? You want to get on with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m looking forward to it because the planning period and the amount of time I have to put things in place is more manageable, so I guess I\u2019m more looking forward to it this time around. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you\u2019re maintaining your positive attitude about going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) I\u2019m just trying to think . . . There\u2019s not a whole lot else that\u2019s going on with me. Like I said, for the better I\u2019ve been kept busy, particularly over the past couple of weeks. I work at the one place most mornings and some weekends and then the other place Monday through Friday in the afternoons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like you\u2019re getting a combined full-time job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Combined, they\u2019ve been a little over 40 hours a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like full time.  Tell me what it\u2019s been like working two jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Since it happened kind of quickly, it went from me just sitting at home looking for work to, like you say, having 40-plus hours a week. It certainly was an adjustment. Some days are very long. Some days I\u2019ll be starting work at the one from about 5:00 AM until 11:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s at a Pete\u2019s Coffee?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then the other one will be from 2:00 until 6:30. They\u2019re all manageable. It\u2019s luckily in the sense that the Pete\u2019s Coffee is about a five-minute walk from door to door. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: From home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. My routine has been waking up at 5:00 coming back, taking a nap, getting changed, and heading off again; so there\u2019s never been a completely overwhelming \u2013 it only happened once and I have since gotten that issue fixed. Once I worked from 5:00 to 12:00 and then 2:00 to 6:30, which was a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">very long day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: So you haven\u2019t had to do that since?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I did that once and I let the guy know what my situation was. They\u2019ve been understanding, so it\u2019s been good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re working how many days at Pete\u2019s Coffee?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: In order to qualify for benefits, which is the reason I took the job, I have to maintain an average of 20 hours a week over every quarter. I\u2019ve been arranging that. This week I\u2019m working two mornings and both Saturday and Sunday. I\u2019m getting just about 20 hours which is primarily the reason, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">the inspiration, behind taking the job. I didn\u2019t apply knowing that I would get benefits. I applied for it before I knew I had anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560770\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it\u2019s a very flexible schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: It can be and from what I\u2019ve experienced so far, they are understanding because a number of people are in my situation where they\u2019re working a couple of jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: So what\u2019s it like actually being there and in that situation doing the job?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Primarily, it\u2019s nice to be doing something. It\u2019s nice to get up with a purpose, a little bit of structure to the day.  Even having co-workers and having that social interaction is nice. At Pete\u2019s Coffee I think most of the employees are give-or-take five or seven years from my age, which in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">the grand scheme of things is not a huge age difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Do you mean younger than you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I think actually most are older than me. At the other place I think it\u2019s even closer. I think I probably am among the older ones there, but most of them are recent university graduates or towards the end of their university careers, so it\u2019s being around younger people which has been good; getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">out and meeting new people. I think particularly with the one at the Community Center, they are people who may be looking for similar careers. I think quite a few of them are looking to do social work and things like that, so it\u2019s people with similar interests career-wise as myself. It\u2019s a share of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">commonality to begin with, which is good. Even at both places, it has been nice that people seem to be embracing the community.  Each is kind of a small community within itself, self-supporting little communities, which I haven\u2019t been involved in for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Correct me if I\u2019m not interpreting this right, but it sounds like you\u2019re feeling comfortable in both interpersonal situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Sure. And I think one thing I have which has been beneficial with both, but particularly with Pete\u2019s Coffee, is most of the places I worked before was a start-up company for one, and then the other was a small mom-and-pop shop in DC. That was a part-time job I had in DC, whereas this is a large, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">well-organized structure.  Both of them are. They\u2019ve given me appropriate training, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before. Most other positions I had been in, they\u2019ve kind of just thrown me in and learn on the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember you talking about that with regards to the place in DC that you were at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Sure. I think it has definitely been good. I\u2019m not seeing myself spending a career at Pete\u2019s Coffee, but the store manager started off there as someone who just made coffee and in ten years worked his way up to being the store manager. I\u2019m kind of being exposed for the first time to a structure <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">where you\u2019re brought on and trained properly and well. There is a definite potential for career progression if you choose it. It\u2019s kind of the first time that I\u2019ve really experienced, as I was saying to my [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:42), it\u2019s kind of a real company as opposed to something that\u2019s just thrown <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F2\">together and trying to figure itself out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: When you say a real company, you mean that they have a particular structure, they have particular procedures, and you know how things work? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560770\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I\u2019m being trained. There is, like you said, procedures for everything. There are proper standards and they\u2019re put in place and everyone is held to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t want to assume that I understand what\u2019s comfortable about that for you, so can you explain?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s comfortable, I think it\u2019s just been a good experience overall being exposed to that because I think, certainly, if I\u2019m going into a university program or going into the educational system it\u2019s set up in a way where there is structure and routine and training involved.  I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">think it\u2019s just been beneficial from the point of view that it is a better-structured organization as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I think I see that it\u2019s like you\u2019re getting practice in working in the kind of system, the kind of organization that you will be in \u2013 both when you go to school and afterwards when you\u2019re working in an educational system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: In a way I think that\u2019s true. The overall environment there is something that, even though it\u2019s a relatively casual workplace compared to when I was in an office before, somehow the overall structure of it is far more professional than I\u2019ve experienced before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Do you feel more secure there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: (pause) There was always the worry of who is going this month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: It was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes. I certainly don\u2019t feel like that. Whereas most people don\u2019t really see themselves staying at Pete\u2019s Coffee forever, I think for a lot of them this is not just a filler job.  This is more long-term; they take it seriously. They want to do well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It sounds also like you know where you are. You know what the procedures are. You know what the expectations are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: That\u2019s\u2019 definitely true. This is my third week there and I\u2019m just now finishing up their training ritual. But when you go in, each day you\u2019re able to see where you\u2019re supposed to be that day and you know, based on what you\u2019ve learned, what is expected of you and you know where you fit into the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">\u201cmachine,\u201d I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: So you make some pretty delicious coffees now, I take it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have learned how to start making the coffees. One thing that surprises me is how much goes into the overall running of everything. There is so much more to it than just brewing and making coffee. With both jobs I think I\u2019m enjoying, to an extent, simply getting out of the house, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">neither job, I would say, is something I dread going to every day. I\u2019m okay in that case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s got to be an improvement over at least what it was like towards the end in DC.  You mentioned that interpersonally in both jobs you really feel comfortable. There is a sense of community among the people in both places. Is there anybody that you\u2019ve connected with that you feel might become a friend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: At Pete\u2019s Coffee, since for most of them there is a bit of an age difference, we\u2019re friendly in the store. Last week they went out to a blues club, but I already had plans for that evening. It was kind of like a store staff outing. At the Community Center I think there are probably more opportunity <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">there, since most people are finishing up college or done with college, so my stage of life, my age.  A lot of them are in my shoes as well. They\u2019ve finished university and this is something they\u2019ve taken to kind of fill the gap and are looking for the next thing or maybe they have something on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">horizon and they need this to fill the time. Certainly that, I think, provides more opportunity. I work particularly with a group that assists the kids in their tutoring program. There is a whole afternoon of activities planned.  Some people work with them in sports, some work with them in music or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F3\">other things, but I was assigned more to the homework side so particularly with people who are working in that area, we\u2019re friendly there and maybe there is potential to socialize outside of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560770\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: In both workplaces, you\u2019ve just come in. You\u2019re the new person that\u2019s come into the group. In each group, how do you imagine they see you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: (pause) Certainly, insofar as the one position, the Community Center, I\u2019m not new to tutoring or I\u2019m not new working with kids.  It was something that I\u2019ve done a lot before. I was more comfortable jumping in right away and getting started, whereas with Pete\u2019s Coffee I didn\u2019t know the procedure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">I didn\u2019t know how to make the drinks. I didn\u2019t know how to work the machinery. Certainly I\u2019m more viewed as the new person at Pete\u2019s Coffee than I am at the Community Center for that reason because I did need more of an initiation period, I guess. But everyone at Pete\u2019s Coffee has been very kind and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">patient.  Everyone has just said afterwards that it takes a couple of months to get fully up to speed because \u2013 I only learned this on my third or fourth day \u2013 apparently this is the second or third busiest Pete\u2019s Coffee in Virginia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Really? Which one is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a 24-hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Ferry and Parkway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the busiest?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: One of the busiest in the state. Everyone seemed to know and tell me and reassure me that even once you\u2019ve been trained and you know what\u2019s going on, especially at the peak times, working at that speed takes a couple of months. You may know how to do something, but like I said, it takes a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">while before you know how to do something in super speed.  To get people in and how, you have to do it there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: A challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: It has been. It\u2019s very, very fast-paced. Last Saturday two people apparently never showed up, so we were two people understaffed. There was myself and another new employee on the floor training. It was like the two of us were, combined, one employee because we were only trained in certain things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">by that point. That was a hectic day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: It sounds like, correct me if I\u2019m wrong about this, but even though in that setting you\u2019re working at super speed and you\u2019re expected to, that you\u2019re feeling up to the challenge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the training has, certainly from my perspective, been good. There is that understanding that you\u2019re not expected from day one to make the most complicated drink in 20 seconds. You\u2019re not expected to know everything from day one that you work there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: So they\u2019re reasonable then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I definitely get the sense that everyone there understands and knows that everyone starts from essentially the same point.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560770\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: They both sound like nice places to work. I asked you a moment ago about how the people there see you. What I was particularly interested in is how they see you as a person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Again, I think I was a little more, maybe not withdrawn, but standing back and observing at Pete\u2019s Coffee to begin with. I guess maybe I\u2019m warming up to the whole environment as time goes on. I probably went into the Community Center with more confidence because I felt I knew what I was doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">and I didn\u2019t really feel like I needed to stand back and learn the ropes and observe. I felt comfortable enough just jumping in and doing because I feel like I\u2019ve done it enough before.  Maybe I was seen as a bit standing back and maybe a bit more cautious because I hadn\u2019t had the experience working <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F2\">in an environment like that before. Particularly at Pete\u2019s Coffee, there are some personalities who work there who seem to make an extra effort to talk more to me or bring me into the group, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: How do you feel when they do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: One lady in particular, I learned that she\u2019s from close to London, which is the school I got into in the Europe. She\u2019s originally from there.  She\u2019s kind of a loud personality, so she has kind of involved me. She is very bubbly and brings everyone in. She seems the sort of person who makes you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">feel comfortable. I think with everyone there, there are no pretenses. Everyone is laid-back. I think it\u2019s part of the company culture where everyone is open and very welcoming.  I think it\u2019s, again, probably part of the whole culture, not just the location I work with, but the whole structure that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">lends itself to that because not just the store manager who is training me, but it\u2019s kind of understood that it\u2019s everyone in the store\u2019s job to do that. (pause) I certainly feel more comfortable in there now, but there was never a point when I felt uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: In both places?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Before you went to college, were you ever in a situation like this where you were living at home, you were going to high school, working \u2013 even though you wouldn\u2019t work this much? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: No. I worked some summers, but again, that was at my high school at the campus. Going in there I knew the teachers. I knew the other counselors who I was working with; so no, not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: So your first experience with work was after you graduated and you started working at this company in DC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I guess that was the first experience of going to an office environment when I didn\u2019t know anybody from the onset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And if I\u2019m hearing you right, right now in these two situations you\u2019re feeling a lot more comfortable, a lot more structure and security than you felt in the company in DC. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes. Another benefit, it\u2019s probably also part of the case, is that the more you do it the more comfortable you get doing it. I did it in DC, so now doing it again is just part of becoming more comfortable with just jumping in and getting going. Just going in with a good attitude, I think, is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">all you can do when you\u2019re going into a new place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So a good part of your week is now spent working and working in pleasant environments. How about your leisure time these days, weekends . . ? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560770\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: A lot of it, especially the last couple of weeks . . . I went out to see a play the other week. It\u2019s been an unusual couple of weeks because my cousin was here so I wasn\u2019t doing too much because I had someone visiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: How old is he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: She is 35. She\u2019s ten years older than I. We had another family member come and visit, so it\u2019s been kind of unusual in that sense of things, not a normal couple of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve been tied up with family when you\u2019re not working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yes. Certainly being in these two positions now will lend itself to doing things outside of work with one group or the other.  I\u2019m not sure if I have done it since I last saw you, but there is a group who meets to watch soccer games, like a supporter\u2019s club of the soccer team I support downtown, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">which I went to. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been in a couple of weeks because the job has scheduled me during the hours that I would. That was one thing I did. It must have been about a month ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: So there\u2019s a team in Woodbridge?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s an English soccer team, but there is a group of people who go to a certain pub downtown to watch the game. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re a member of this group?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes. I went the one time and since then, for one reason or another, being scheduled for work or being tied up with family arrangements, I haven\u2019t been able to get down there again, but it was a good experience.  It was nice watching with . . . I was joking around with my friends who are fans <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">of other teams that it was nice watching with somebody that I don\u2019t argue with during the game. Again, that was something that meeting up with people, I guess it\u2019s just the fact that from the onset you know you have one thing in common to talk about so you can kind of start from there. I got talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B72\">to one guy and finding out more about him. Again, that was a good thing. Hopefully I\u2019ll get one weekend day that I can head down there again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: That sounds like another third situation \u2013 you talk about the two work situations \u2013 that sounds like a third social situation where you\u2019re getting your feeling accepted and comfortable, part of the group. They kind of welcomed you into it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: I went down there and everyone was kind of wearing the jerseys so, as soon as somebody sees you wearing the jersey, without even talking to that person just by seeing the jersey that\u2019s an automatic connection talking point just to kick something off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Things have changed dramatically for you in the last month or two. When we first started meeting you were home, sitting home and feeling like you were kind of getting more and more stuck at home without anything to do outside. Now it seems like you\u2019re filling your days and your weeks with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">activity, whether it\u2019s work or the soccer group, filling your time with activities where you feel comfortable and accepted by the people that you\u2019re with. How do you feel about that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: I definitely think when I came back I didn\u2019t have a plan of where I envisioned things, but this is more along the lines of what I had intended to try and achieve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: When you came back from DC?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, not just sitting and mulling around, but doing things to get me out of the house. I guess the different things have fallen into place nicely. It happened that one of the jobs that I found was the tutoring job, which will be a benefit when I go off to grad school.  Certainly the Pete\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">Coffee position just kind of fell into my lap \u2013 and with the benefits. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. That had been, not a huge worry, but a bit of a worry thinking what I would do about health coverage and, certainly, this takes some of that weight off, the burden off.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560770\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: How did these two positions fall into your hands?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: The one at the Community Center I just stumbled upon on Craig\u2019s List, which is one of the job boards I looked at and Pete\u2019s Coffee, I think, I had been talking about looking for part time with a friend and they said their cousin or something worked for Pete\u2019s Coffee.  She just applied through <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C71\">the website and they called her a couple of days later and she has a job now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t sound like these jobs fell into your lap. You had to choose to go out and apply for them and get them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yes. I just mean it seemed to fall nicely into place, in that they seem to fit together nicely most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I wanted to make that point because I think it\u2019s relative to a broader issue that we\u2019ve talked about, which is your uncertainty sometimes as to whether or not you\u2019re up to the challenge, regardless of what the challenge is \u2013 and here you took the initiative.  You may have found these possibilities <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">by a friend telling you or whatever, but you had to take the initiative to go out and apply and get yourself hired, so I don\u2019t think you should underestimate your role in getting these jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s certainly more of an initiative than I have taken in the past. Certainly last year, I think we\u2019ve discussed, I was so set on one thing that I wasn\u2019t going to bother looking for possible social groups or work while I was waiting for that one thing to happen. This wasn\u2019t sitting back and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">waiting around this time, which is good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: What do you think made the difference? Why do you think you\u2019ve been more pro-active this time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: I think probably because I recognize that doing that last year did more damage. It didn\u2019t serve me well at all. Obviously when the time came in September, I didn\u2019t feel like I was ready or able to do it. So I guess I just felt like I didn\u2019t want to feel in that situation again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: In other words, you\u2019re learning from experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: (chuckles) It\u2019s better than having the same thing happen over and over again, which I was starting to get into that pattern. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s where you get wisdom, learning from your experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s happening now after a couple of trial and errors. It was just the fact that I didn\u2019t want a repeat of last year\u2019s events this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: It sounds like, again correct me if I\u2019ve got the wrong impression, but it sounds like you\u2019re feeling pretty positive about the short-term future and the longer-term future at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: I think so. Obviously, ideally a year ago this is not where I saw myself, but I recognize this is where I am right now and it\u2019s not a terrible place to be. There are people, certainly, far worse. I\u2019m lucky enough to have two jobs, one of which will provide benefits, whereas a lot of people are <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">in worse positions and clamoring for what I have now.  At the end of it I still intend on taking a position at a grad school for next year. That\u2019s the next step that I already have somewhat taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560770\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Do you know specifically when the application process is going to open up for getting housing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: Students will just be applying to the schools now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Just applying to get into the programs? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yes. I think that just opened up in mid-October. I have a profile of mine somewhere that is with the central governing body that regulates the teaching qualifications; and my program will tell them to switch my number or whatever over to next year. At that point, I think I\u2019ll be able to start <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">moving forward with housing. Normally when something changes on my profile I get notification by e-mail. When I was accepted and they gave me a deferral they sent an e-mail each time saying, \u201cSomething has changed. Check your profile.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re expecting to get an e-mail notification when you can apply for housing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll stay on top of it. I won\u2019t want too much longer before touching base because I don\u2019t want them to forget that I sat here waiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Right. You\u2019ve learned to be more pro-active.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Probably every couple of weeks just as a reminder of who I am, that kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Sounds like a good idea. We need to stop for today. Okay. I\u2019ll see you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: I gave you the right one, didn\u2019t I? My parents ran out of checks so I lent them a check of mine.
