So of course I left here and was that Friday, I don't know what the fuck day, it's Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: That was Monday. So I left here and Kelly and I texted, you know, and I was totally myself, she was like \"how are you, what's going on\" whatever, and I said \"how was your weekend\", whatever. I was like \"well I saw a bunch of my friends and there's some people looking forward to meeting you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\"> So, she was like \"Yay, you know, exclamation mark\". So I definitely spent the rest of Monday just, like I said in here, just kinda like (pause) perfectly happy with that situation, but realizing it has nothing to do with that situation. So...(pause) I mean I'm still being, like, after she said I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">so like happy (laugh) I was like (laugh) leave it at that (ph). So I haven't texted her since Monday, figure I'll leave her, obviously tomorrow, but (pause). So there were a few things. One was even before I felt that relief, when I got to the Starsucks (ph) there at the Center (ph), I did feel a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">bit, not better, but I felt like I was kind of coaching myself better.  I just found that I was somehow feeling, I can't explain it exactly but I sensed a little bit more, I was like, \"alright, whatever man\". Oh, I, especially (inaudible). When I was like \"oh, that's what it was\". Because I was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">\"when some friends, people (inaudible)\". She didn't respond to that immediately. We were going back and forth and on that one I didn't hear, so then I was like \"Oh shit, did I say too much, like I have friends that want to meet you.\" So that part, then I was good, I stopped it. And of course then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">heard from her like five hours, whatever, she's like \"yay!\". So it's just, I gotta just chill out with that. The more I realize it's not having anything to do with (pause). It was good too because I was happy but I didn't get too happy, you know what I mean? Because now I know this is nothing to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200176\">with anything, my excitement, or my whatever anxiety...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Despair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Despair...have nothing to do with this girl and and texting, you know?  I mean I really want it to work out but that has nothing to do with being so sad or so happy. So now it's good, it felt kinda, I can't explain it, but something in me was like \"alright\". Maybe because I saw it for what it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">was, made me feel better, just that made me feel better. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: All of the hope and wish and fantasy doesn't get solidified as about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I reminded myself, so right now, it's great, I heard that. But again next week she could decide she doesn't want to be with me. Next year, in two weeks, that's never gonna end, you know what I mean? Like I need to somehow, really get over that because someone could be getting back to you non-stop <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">and then all of the sudden for some reason they're not. Things do happen and I don't mean that in a negative way, just mean it in like (pause). I think it's important in life to be able to handle either way, good stuff and bad stuff, as level headed as you can be.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098454\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Then what if it didn't work out because of her? The old stuff in your wants to kinda take that as incredibly personal...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Instead of, you know, you've alluded to the timing of people meeting, seems like that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, things (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Like things don't work out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Jobs, bosses, any kind of interpersonal anything. Just can't (pause). And it's also a flip side of, you also have to allow yourself to enjoy when things are going well without getting too euphoric, you know what I mean? You can't be in a constant state of bracing yourself for (pause). So in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">that way it was good, I felt like Monday I was myself, I was texting her, it was all good and I felt you know (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: So you think it's shifted a little?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: A little bit, I mean it's not day and night, but a little bit . (pause) So the more you see the absurdity of your behavior, that helps to not, with me, helps not to act that way as much, you know what I mean? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: You're also starting to talk about this image of a man as a particular kind of pillar of strength and stoicism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I just wonder, it sounds like it feels so much a truth inside you, that it almost doesn't occur to you to start talking about it and it may be something that just somehow what you grew to believe. So to know and say that out loud...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Look at it and figure out where it came from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right, it's just, I mean that's definitely just as much a fantasy as all the other fantasies of my life, you know, about like women, (inaudible) or music, you know what I mean?  It was funny because I was actually, Monday night I went to Dave's so we could finish the record you know. So it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">totally subconscious but I think while I was there I felt so much more, I mean I always feel comfortable with Dave, he's one of my best friends but I felt extra comfortable because I was like \"yeah, I wouldn't want this life.\" He's completely broke, you know, his girlfriend shafted him over the summer, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">like what (inaudible). It's like I'm looking for something that's not there, I'm looking for someone to be a brother figure or a father figure or you know what I mean? He's just a friend of mine so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Honestly does it feel extreme (ph) to see the real Dave, instead of a fantasy of Dave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah giving him, what's the word? I can't think of the word, when you give someone credit but you, fuck, what's that word? You designate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Bestow? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: No you, like being cool or being stoic I give those qualities to him, I hate that. (laugh) Anyway, I give him credit for these things that may or may not be there but regardless they're not things up on a pedestal and they're not things that I don't have I just think I don't have them. That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">the whole other thing is that. Of course I forget all the times people have told me how well I handle things, and I'm always calm and I give such great advice . I forget all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: So what is it, when you think about him, what have you given him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: When you say giving him these...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Attributes? Damn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: What qualities? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: That whole cool, kind of aloof, it's as if things don't bother him and because of that he's...that part of me feels like that's why he's more attractive to people than you are. He kind of just doesn't care at all, all this shit, and it's nonsense, of course he cares, he was a wreck, his girlfriend <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">dumped him over the summer... Again it's the idea that even though we're the exact same age I think he's older, you know what I mean? He's somehow more something, I don't even know what it is. So... and that's generally what I do without a lot of my guy friends, not all, but generally, that somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">they're living life more or something, they're in it more. I don't know what that means. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098454\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Hmm. So they, I mean we don't talk as much about men as women but men can have that kind of idealization too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Totally, yeah totally. Like women, certainly guys. It's not with all women (ph), it's not with all my guy friends I have some guy friends that I don't think about that but yeah some friends I think it might be connected to some music things or artistic things or not that it involves them, nothing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">I mean it's not artistically....He's the one that's always saying you know \"I can't believe how amazing these songs sound. You somehow write songs all the time.\" It's more that he somehow, or somehow that makes me feel somehow worse or something. Then I feel like \"yeah I do do all of that and look at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">me?  Should I be doing better?\" Maybe there's a little bit of that, you know what I mean? Or there's the sense of, that yeah, somehow he's more together... I don't know, I don't know what it is? With other guys it's more antagonistic (ph), not with friends, but if Dave and I are out and we see acquaintances, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200573\">it's more like \"these fucking hipster dufuses\" (sp), they just seem so kinda carefree, they're so excited because they're doing some bullshit thing, you know what I mean? It's something about that, again I know that I'm projecting because who knows what the fuck those people are going through? But I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200574\">definitely projecting and also because I seem the same way to them. Right? It's nonsense. \"What are you up to? \u2018Well I just played in The City'...\" Right, they could be saying the same thing but, you know, it's just the way I feel.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Discovering that they too (ph) are projective objects, they're not actually whole people, but certain people who fit certain criteria of the fantasy get sort of pulled into the fantasy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just thought of one story, about when Dave was going through a really hard time, we were hanging out like every night and went to this shitty bar and all the sudden, I hate it (ph), but went to this shitty bar there. It was fun, we were having a good time, but I was also kind of in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">bad place, I wasn't feeling quite as good as I feel right now or as I've been feeling, or maybe it was just that day, I don't know what it was but we ran into this guy we know and he and Dave started talking and I felt left out and so when they were done talking and the guy left and whatever I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">pissed and I went off, was like \"fuck\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Went off on Dave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Not on Dave, but I went off. I vented, I vented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: But not to Dave about Dave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: No, no, no, not about Dave, cause it wasn't about Dave, I just felt like that guy was kind of ignoring me and wasn't including me and you know I was like, fuck this, you know, all this stuff.  (laughs) Dave was like \"oh man, I'm sorry, it's just, you know we were talking about my ex because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">he knows her\". They were talking about something that just was personal kind of and you know, include me in what? (ph) He's wasn't being an asshole he was just talking to Dave about something serious that Dave's going through and he knows his ex and I guess he had hooked up with Dave's ex years ago. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200632\">There's some history there so I took something that had nothing to do with me, you know and I made it about me, and I just, that's my mom's side, you know, that's, I don't like that. That was a good...It doesn't mean I love that guy, I still think that guys a little bit whatever, but the point is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200633\">he's not going out of his way, he always says hi to me, he's a nice guy. It's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098454\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: His intention was not to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, deliberate. Every time I've seen him he goes out of his way to say hello, come on, he might be a bit of a dope or whatever but no more or less than me if you look at it from the outside right? They don't know me, that guy doesn't really know me well. You know what I mean? Like I always <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">have this sense that I'm the one, again set outside, when I go to the bar, well that's not always the case but...And in certain settings I'm the one whose the outsider and it's like the cool kids in high school and they've somehow let me in but I'm not completely in.  I still do feel like musically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">I still feel that way a little bit, you know I, but now I'm getting better at reminding myself that it's not personal, that's a small town and it's cliquey, you know, and indie rock is cliquier than other cliques and it's just people and their cool little friends and their cool little bands. That started <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200673\">actually motivating me, now I feel like that instead of it like making me so angry, now it's just motivating. It's like well I don't know, I just played a great show in the city on a Saturday night so, I don't...But (pause) Anyway that's the bottom line a lot of times, or not a lot of times, there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200674\">just certain situations where that voice comes up and I just feel kinda like yeah these people are all being nice to me but (pause)...like I'm a second tier person, you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like one of the things you're doing is pulling apart the difference between how you feel and what someone's intentions and actions are about. That just because you feel a certain thing doesn't mean that's what actually the intention or what's happening...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Not only that but I'm realizing now that that's the sad part. Right now I'm realizing not only just because it's a 99 percent of the time that seems to be the case, that's what the sadness is about. Like, pretty much every fucking time I'm wrong. What if I come in here and say \"yeah I was feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">blah blah blah\" and then I was right? That's like never happened, you know. So I mean I do think I'm kinda good at reading people but in terms of when I really feel something, that's nine out of ten its way off, way off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: It's kind of definition if you boil it down to what paranoia is.

I was like \"oh my god, people like me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: You had friends...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: It was because I didn't go to their parties, I didn't hang out with them, I didn't you know. Same with my first year in college, you know. Not to mention more and more I realize now that these are people I don't necessarily want to be friends with anyway, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Which is a totally separate thing, right? That's what you're saying, right? If you can make it through to \"it doesn't really matter\" then there's some space to actually think about who they are as separate people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah but I want to be friends with like alcoholics and just because I think, or a part of me thinks they're somehow cooler than me? I mean, they're not cool. I see that now but...  It's crazy, it's crazy. I definitely see it more and more, I mean, for example when I go with Dave to certain bars, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">it's not Dave that gets the special treatment, I get the special treatment. The bartenders know me, you know, they treat me nice, they ask me how I'm doing, you know, they'll give me a special coosi (sp) for my fucking beer that they don't give other people so (laughs) I mean, that's my fault for not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">being able to see things for what they are. In the past I'd be like \"yeah they just want tips\", I've kind of, there could be some truth to that but, you know, at the same time (pause). You know, I remember one time I was thinking that on my way home, I was like \"what am I saying?\" My tips for my Buds? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F3\">They're selling fucking fancy drinks left and right...I go there to drink Bud and they're always fucking nice to me, they're always like sweet, they're, so they're that bad? These people are that bad that they're just, you know what I mean?  Like when I really stop to think about it, I was like just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F4\">for the extra few dollar tip on fucking Budweiser's, I was like come on man, that's like beyond cynical, you know? It's actually the opposite, they're doing that to the other people, that they don't know that well, who are getting expensive drinks, who are kinda douchey (sp), that's who they're doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F5\">that to, you know? It's the exact inverse, you know what I mean? When I go there, they're happy because I'm a nice guy, I go there with nice friends, we have nice chats, we talk about music and just life. It's like, it's very, that's my mom's side, you know, that's very, no matter how nice you might <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F6\">be, I can't let you, you know? Like here, it's like, oh well, at the end of the day it's about money, it's her job, it's like everything I find a way to, or if I let myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: But it's really hard for you to imagine and believe I might care about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, or that any, when I go out and see people I know, if we're not tight, tight friends that deep down I'll feel like, you know?  I don't know, I'll just be suspect a little bit of stuff.

I felt like he was, \"did we talk about?\" Yeah, so even there, you know, it's like \"dude he's not my dad, you know, he's not my dad.\" He's a, he has a very, very busy, full life.  And also I'm the one that left, right? I mean I was his star guy, and I left. I had good reason to leave but, so, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">he was being friendly, but not overly friendly. And again it was like \"so what?\" It was that idea that I was feeling, but yeah that's it, \"I'll never publish another book again, like what am I saying?\" You know it's like this very infantile...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: That's the feeling of a child...that's if you're parents don't love you, in your mind, if that's what you experience, if you don't feel love, that is the end of it, as a child and I think you do carry that feeling with you about men into relationships now. It's best if he doesn't, if she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200891\">doesn't, then that's it, that proves it.  As though in some way in the fantasy that they're each you're mother and you're father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Looking still for that validation, confirmation, you never got.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it's like \"what am I saying\", I already did get published so... I already have a foot in the door in general, like now I can go to a different publisher if I want, like yeah I'm not out of nowhere, this is what I've...you know not only that Jason is still Jason, if I have him a manuscript <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">that's just as good as what I wrote before he's gonna be like (inaudible) you know what I mean? It's just, you know, I wanted him to like take an extra interest in the real stuff that he did a little bit when I first got there, the first time. But even that, even if I'd have stayed those things can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F2\">be forever, you know what I mean?  That was initially, I was excited, he was excited, he probably wanted me to feel comfortable and all that. But the guy's not gonna adopt me or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: That may be sad? (ph) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Funny thing though, is like I was thinking, like the one hump I'm still not able to get, I think I'll get over, I don't know why it's taking so long and it's excruciating, is that I still can't take advantage of my time to be more productive, it's just not happening. Like lately with work, our <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">meetings, we've had a couple of meeting, those got canceled and I'm literally doing like nothing. I'm fine with that, it's all good, but I feel stupid for not taking advantage of that time. I mean, you know what I mean? I don't know what that is about anymore, I don't, I don't understand it, I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200932\">understand it. You know what I mean? To me that's very strange, like no one's bothering me. I have a department, like things are in the right place, you know what I mean? I have a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: In your external life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: But not inside?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098454\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so that's what I'm assuming again but although that's odd to me. I feel like a lot of, that should make me want to write in a way, to get stuff... I don't know, I don't know what it is.  It's really bothering me. I don't understand it. I even kind of try sometimes, like I'll open a file <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">or I'll sometimes I'll like try to like write an e-mail to myself, like little tricks to try to get me to write and just, I don't know. And it can't be that I have nothing, there's like nothing, cause there's just not, there's a lot to write, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: There was a time a few weeks ago where you, we had just been talking about the feeling that you don't yet have the story of what you want to write and all the sudden you started writing for a couple days. Do you remember that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: You actually came in here with more detailed memory then I've ever heard for the next couple days about things from the past. It sort of felt like something had opened up. It doesn't mean I feel like what you wrote has much substance yet but you started writing something then stopped again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. It's not, it's just not getting into, I feel like with writing there has to be something regular about it.  Otherwise, it's actually more frustrating, I'd rather just not do it, you know what I mean? It's not like music to me, you know? There has to be something, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">it really is just a zone you go to a place and you can't just keep, it's to....I don't know what the word is. It's too like schizophrenic to keep like a little bit here and then not, and then a little bit and then not, and then just like all over the place. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So what stops you from just setting aside in your schedule, in your planner, several chunks of time where it's your writing time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: That's what I'm saying. I don't understand anymore, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Have you tried that? Where you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: I mean I'm at Starsucks (ph) all day doing nothing right? So yeah I'll be like \"okay, how about writing a little bit?\" It's like I don't go, \"gosh I should be writing here all day.\" I know enough to know that a page, I'd be happy with a fucking page you know? Doesn't happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But what if you said, not all day but at 9 am, from 9 to 10 I write everyday? Then I stop writing at 10?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: What would happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: I have no idea. I think why, I worry, I've tried that in the past, I don't do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What happens?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: That's what I'm trying... I don't know, I don't know what the deal is. I don't know what, I don't know if I'm scared to do it, I'm, my brain is too full so I don't know what to start with, I don't know what to say. I don't know. Like I'm all over the place, I don't know if I should write a poem <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">or just write a straight-forward, like history or you know what I mean, of my, or write a novel...like I think I'm just all over the place when it comes to that. Either that or those are excuses not to write, I have no idea, I don't know, I don't know anymore. It doesn't make any fucking sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: What are you most wanting to work on right now? What's the next step?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: I think the easiest thing to finish would be, not easiest, but I feel like the next book of poems should be done by now you know? Just should be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098454\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It has some? It's partly done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I've got like 50 pages. Most poetry manuscripts are like 40-60 pages but the problem is a lot of those I don't like anymore. I feel like I'm changing and I, so there's that, but also just I feel like I don't know why I'm not able to just write a straight-forward, just to document things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">Do you know what I mean? That's really weird to me that I can't do that, just for myself. Be like \"okay, my mom's family got on a boat from Beirut to Armenia on this date and this is what happened.\" Not for literary value just to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Like so not even concerned with the quality of the writing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and I'm not able to do that, I'm not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">THERAPIST: So what's, what happens? You go to do it and what happens?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">CLIENT: I feel like the sentences are stupid and I feel like it's boring, I feel like who cares. I don't, I mean I don't know if that's exactly what I'm thinking but something just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It's extreme self-criticism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think that's why I've never been able to keep journals or anything. I can't just be free, like I love looking at other people's journals, you know? They're so...you know? Lists and sketches and just doodles and everything, you know, who cares? I cannot fucking do that. I can't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF1\">do it. I've bought so many journals and just, there's nothing. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">THERAPIST: It does sound like being almost constricted in your freedom of expression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, remember I've said before like it literally feels like a block, like something is, like, yeah. Yeah, because I know myself, I know there's plenty to write, plenty.  There's something about not allowing myself to just write shitty pages, write shit that I'm not gonna keep, you know? Then <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D31\">write a poem, then not write a poem, then write a couple pages of something else, like who cares? That's the process you know? That's what I do with music. When I sit down I play something, then I play something else, then I come back to that then I...that's no problem but for some reason with writing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D32\">it's like fucking pulling hair, pulling teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I wonder if that comes up sometimes in here too? That it sometimes feels it can feel like you're supposed to have the right answer or the right idea or if you say something that isn't quite what you mean or that changes once it starts coming out of your mouth, like it's not...You get very <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D51\">all the sudden self-conscious and self-critical about what it is you're saying that wasn't quite right. You don't get to just play, try ideas, discard some and just see what comes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: It's not free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">CLIENT: No, that's true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Like I think a little bit about that when you, you know we've talked a little bit about, it's this, but then you say on the other hand I...like it's one way of sort of having to make sure that I get it, or that you get the complete picture so that there are no misinterpretations, following <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD1\">that line into it's intensity and what's in there and like if that isn't the perfect end picture of you, you get worried we have to, you know, make sure we get the whole thing. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: It's true. (pause) I mean, all I can think is, the only thing that all of these things have in common is that, you know, you're vulnerable if you do any of those things. Right? If you sit down, you just write, write, write you know, you're vulnerable. If you come in here and you follow something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF1\">all the way to the end you're vulnerable. That's the only commonality I can see, you know what I mean? So that's what I'm saying maybe it's a fear thing, you know? I'm scared to write a great book, I'm scared to just I don't know, I have no idea cause I can't think of what ...It'd be different if I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF2\">was like \u2018I can't think of any ideas, I don't know what to write\" you know? That's not the case, you know?  So all I can think is that something is finding a way to get me not to accomplish that so then, then it can say \"see\" or something I guess so that I can be like \"ah, you suck\" you know or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098454\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Although that's a kind of safer place to criticize from than what if you write it, or what if you go down one of these pathways and you find something you don't like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: What if it feels terrible or what if it feels really vulnerable, you know if you really invest in line, not knowing where it's going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Well I think that's the thing too, I think with writing maybe that's the thing, especially with prose that, you know, maybe something in me doesn't want to go to that place, you know what I mean? Who wants to sit around writing all the details of how their father died or about all these bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E71\">things about them, you know? It's just a lot, it's a lot you know? So maybe there's just something in me that finds a way to (pause)... That's probably the same with exercise, you know? I'll be all healthy and stronger, whatever, that doesn't fit with the voice that says \"yeah a bigger (ph) and ugly <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200E72\">loser, you know what I mean?
