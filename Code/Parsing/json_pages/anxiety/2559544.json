[0:05:00] It's the end of the semester, so I'm trying to write a grant application. And my professors are kind of busy, and they have events. And they want me to go to school tomorrow to attend them.

I know this is professional, but, I mean, sometimes it feels odd because you know pretty much everything about me (laughing).

But (pause) yeah, no (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FF\">THERAPIST: You're not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20101\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) I mean, it's possible, right? I mean, because people have preferences, people have opinions. [0:08:01] So... (Pause) (Sniffing) But I think what you said last time kind of really helped me (chuckling), so (sighing)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20103\">THERAPIST: What are you referring to in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20105\">CLIENT: Just the thing about how Victor (sp?) is part of a narrative for me, so I felt... I mean, I became conscious of ways that... and started to kind of at least try to think differently about not seeking out something that feels like a rejection, that just feels like deliberate torture (chuckling), <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201051\">deliberate punishing myself. [0:09:05] I mean, I'm not conscious when I have been doing it, but now I'm trying to be conscious that... and you said I think about him when I'm feeling low, right? So I guess I'm trying not to seek that out. I think... yeah, if I feel low, then I seek out stuff that makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201052\">me feel even lower (chuckling), something like, oh, yeah, I didn't get this. Well, there's another thing, that huge thing that I didn't get, and that's so sad. And so I try not to... you're climbing down the stairs, and then you take... you jump down even further (chuckling). So instead of jumping down <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201053\">at least just stay there, and then climb back up. [0:09:54] Climbing back up would be the next step, but at least not going further down. So, I mean, it's tempting to think... it's really, really tempting to think about him and make myself feel low. But I try not to, I guess. And I guess what you said <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201054\">last time... I guess we'll have to talk about love, but I suppose we can do that in the future (chuckling). But (sighing), I mean, just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20107\">THERAPIST: In the future? You don't want to talk about it now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20109\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Well, you know, if it comes up, if it's something that's... I mean, yeah, I'm trying to think how much of a priority it is in my life. I started saying things like, I don't believe in love (chuckling). [0:10:57] (inaudible at 0:10:59). I said yesterday something like, I believe in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201091\">God, but I don't believe in love (chuckling). But... (Pause) Because earlier before the whole Victor episode I didn't really think about love. I didn't invest much time in thinking about it in my relationship with Chris (sp?) because we were on autopilot. And we both had our dreams to achieve and work <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201092\">on. So that relationship bit was just kind of there, and living together makes it actually harder to be a couple, right? [0:11:58] Because, I mean, I guess that's what Victor made me aware of. He wouldn't see me more than once a week, and earlier he would... it seems like he invested a lot of time thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N201093\">of what to do and how to have a good time with someone you're romantically involved with or even just fooling around with (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B\">So we didn't do much of that. We busy, busy, busy, and then Chris would say, let's go away. And we'd go away, but we'd take our heads with us. So we would both be preoccupied and miserable. We'd do something like go watch a movie at the... during the vacation. And we both would hate it and just pile <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B1\">on (chuckling). So we don't really think about how to make it better and that I certainly wasn't happy. [0:13:05] And Chris, I guess he wasn't happy, but he didn't care. Like, it's not a priority to him that things feel a certain way or look a certain way or make him happy, you know? Maybe it does. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B2\">I don't know. But it doesn't seem like that from his behavior, right? That he would judge an experience on the basis of how it makes him feel, at last in the relationship. So (sniffing)... (Pause) I mean, I guess with my first boyfriend I had moments of (chuckling) feeling in love. [0:13:54] Like, your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2010B3\">first love is always like that when you remember it. I'm glad we were in the south, and we had sunny days (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2010A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2010A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559544\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">THERAPIST: It doesn't feel like you have sunny days here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">CLIENT: Not this year (laughing). It's so cold! But I don't know, I just... I guess it makes a difference. For me it makes a difference, having a campus... having had a campus and having lived in it for four years and away from my parents, oh God (chuckling). So (inaudible at 0:14:35) skipping classes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F1\">and could instead and just hanging out, [me and Jeremy] (ph) (chuckling, sniffing). So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">THERAPIST: That was his name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). [0:14:57] Yeah, I mean, things got messed up because of my parents, but, until they did, it was all right, I guess? (Pause) (Sniffing) I mean, I wonder if I have, like my dad... I have a roving eye (chuckling). I'm kind of concerned about that also. Even when I was with Jeremy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201131\">I mean, if another guy looked at me or expressed interest, I was intrigued by that. And I was... I mean, Jeremy was too jealous, and he would throw a tantrum (chuckling). [0:15:56] So that kind of made me not explore what was the other possibilities. But actually I did one summer. I was... I had an <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201132\">internship, so (coughing) I had moved to a different state (sniffing). Yeah, and this guy in my office, he was better-looking or taller or stronger (chuckling). And I had no friends and no other community, so I kind of had a crush on him? So... but nothing happened because he wasn't attracted to me <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201133\">(chuckling, sniffing). So... but Jeremy got wind of it and got very upset (chuckling). [0:16:57] So then I just was like, why can't I stay faithful to Jeremy in my heart (chuckling)? (Pause) I guess I wasn't... because we were in the south or because we were part of a church, I didn't really think (pause), <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201134\">like, it's time to move on. We've exhausted that relationship, so we... I should move on (chuckling). I felt tied to Chris... Jeremy. (Sighing) And he was... (Pause) Because he taught me to drive, and he was like a father figure (chuckling). So it felt like I couldn't really break off with him, even <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201135\">though I guess I may have wanted to. [0:17:59] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">It just seems like... yeah, so, I mean, that was my earlier... earliest experience of love (chuckling). I mean, but I guess with Victor everything was just very different. And another thing that keeps... that makes me think about him is my friend at school (chuckling). She is having this kind of relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201151\">right now, and any time she talks about her boyfriend, which is all the time (chuckling), really reminds me of Victor because of the things that she says, you know? I never felt this way about anyone else, and (chuckling) I invited her to a picnic on Sunday. [0:19:01] And she merrily sends me an e-mail <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201152\">saying, we woke up at 1:00, and we don't feel like going out at 3:00 (chuckling). And I was telling Chris, what is she doing? Why is she so proud of the fact that we woke up late together, woke up at one (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20114-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20114-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559544\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Why do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: I don't know. Being in love and spending an awesome night together, I don't know (laughing). And being lazy and decadent and (sniffing) waking up is quite an achievement (chuckling). For those of us how have... stick to routines, go to bed at 12:00 the latest and wake up at 7:00, right (ph)? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201191\">[0:20:01] (Pause) I guess I'm just (sniffing)... with Chris it's just, like, the innocence is there, and I really just... I actually treasure it. I value it just because I think that's what makes you young or... as an artist that's... that childhood innocence makes you see things. (Pause) Otherwise <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201192\">you get jaded (sniffing). So I value that, but (blowing nose) I guess now I'm wondering, just how important is chemistry and just how important is that thing about staying up all night and waking up at 1:00 (chuckling). [0:21:00] I only did that with Victor (sniffing), so I'm not sure if it's important <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201193\">to me. And I do think about him when my friend talks about her boyfriend. And I guess maybe instead of analyzing what I felt about him I just kind of call it love? But maybe it's not love if you're saying he's part of a narrative that is put in place to make me feel bad about myself (chuckling). So <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201194\">I'm not making a lot of sense (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Really, you don't feel you are (clearing throat)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, my thoughts usually look (ph) disjointed. I don't know if all that I've said as a thread. It just feels a little awkward (chuckling). [0:22:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: I think it's confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is confusing (sighing). (Pause) (Sniffing, chuckling) I mean, love is complicated, right? So there're so many aspects, there're so many ways it can go wrong. So... and you change over time, so when you go back (chuckling), it's not even linear. So just... I don't know. (Pause) [0:23:04] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201211\">I guess we can... I can put it in a question form (chuckling). That's the... it seems to me, the form that I'm most comfortable with here... or one of the forms. So my question would be, do you think I love Victor (chuckling)? I mean, it's not even important, I guess, because he's out of the picture, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201212\">I suppose. But I guess a conclusion or resolution, and the answer has to be no, so (laughing)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: So it's not a question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: No, it is a question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: But there's only one answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah! [0:23:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">THERAPIST: So it's not a question...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: I mean, you can say a different answer. I just will say you're wrong (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">THERAPIST: I see. So, if you have a sense of what the right answer is, why do you think you need to ask me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: Because I still think about him (chuckling). I have to tell my friend, don't talk about your boyfriend (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: Because it reminds me of him. (Pause) (Sniffing) [0:25:00] (Sighing) I mean, do you see a pattern? I guess there is a pattern between Jeremy and Chris (chuckling). And I feel like maybe I have a way of destroying relationships (chuckling) by depending too much and by making them my father figure, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201391\">even if they may not be. (Pause) [0:26:00] [0:26:56] I guess maybe it's hard for me to distinguish need from love. Like, I'm thinking... I mean, I'm looking for apartments and not really feeling too strongly about moving out (chuckling). And I'm feeling like, can I really live away from Chris, and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201392\">the meaning of that statement, if it's... there's probably very little romantic connotations in that statement, but more about (sniffing) the need for companionship, the need for the intellectual grounding, the need to have my finances taken care of (chuckling). (Pause) Yeah. [0:27:57] But, I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201393\">if you say this out loud to someone then you say, wow, you love me, if you're saying I cannot live without you (chuckling). Then, if you tell him no, it's because I need you to pay the bills (chuckling), I need you to make me work, I need you to... I need to eat with someone, cook for two people instead <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201394\">of one, I need to feel safe at night.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20138-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20138-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559544\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: So maybe the question is, do you need him as a child, or do you need him as an adult?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: What's the difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Does it not feel like a difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">CLIENT: No, I just mean, like, what do you mean by an adult?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: Well, a child needs their parents [as their parents] (ph) to survive...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:28:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">THERAPIST: To take care of them in a very basic way because they're unable to take care of themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">CLIENT: Hmm (sniffing). And what's the other one? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">THERAPIST: They don't need them to survive (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">CLIENT: What do you need them for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">THERAPIST: I don't know, what do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">CLIENT: I don't know. (Chuckling) Companionship? I don't know (chuckling). (Pause) (Sniffing) So how much of it is me being a child and him being the adult? And how much of it is both of us being adult? I guess that is (sighing)... [0:30:01] (Pause) [0:31:00] I mean, if you say a child needs to be taken <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201511\">care of because he cannot do it himself, that makes me kind of feel bad because maybe I want to be childlike in my innocence or curiosity about the world. But I don't want to be childlike in the sense that I cannot take care of myself, you know (chuckling)? (Pause) (Sighing) [0:31:53] But... (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201512\">I don't know, I feel like there's been different... things in my life have required me to have to play different roles, maybe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">Like, when I was a child I couldn't be a child because of my dad, because he was a child. So I had to put up with his tantrums. And suddenly... maybe I wasn't an adult, I didn't have an adult-like demeanor. But I had to have adult-like understanding and patience. And then I could be a child again when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201531\">it was just me and my mom. And then when we came here to the US I had to be an adult again and get a job and be responsible and teach my mom how to drive and take care of her. [0:33:09] But then I could be a child again in some scenarios where a father figure boyfriend would step in and teach me driving <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201532\">or take care of me, you know? So I feel like, yeah, when people accuse me of being childlike or behaving childishly (chuckling), I feel I put up a defense, and I say things in my defense. No, but I was responsible. I came here 15... when I was 15, and I had to take care of my parents. And that must <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201533\">mean... that proves that I was an adult. Then they're like, no, but you throw these tantrums. That means that you're a child still. You haven't grown up. [0:33:59] So I'm like, okay (chuckling), I guess in that aspect I am a child. So I feel like there hasn't been a uniform progression towards adulthood <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201534\">(chuckling). So (Sighing) I guess that reflects in relationships.

But that's what I imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I wish I could be aware of what I'm putting out, so I don't put it out (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: Well (clearing throat), but there's a part of you that wants to be childlike so you're taken care of. So part of you wants to put it out that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">CLIENT: Well, that's what I'm wondering what... like, maybe I can change that. Maybe I should try out not wanting to be taken care of (chuckling) and see how I do. Maybe I don't need to be taken care of. Do I put... like, not just in our conversation, but generally do I put that out? Like, do you see it? [0:35:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Do I see it in here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: Yes, at times. When you ask me questions, they feel... there's a question, there's sort of an innocence. Well, what do you think? How do I feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: There's a childlike quality to that, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: And then also the way of-this is related at times-not taking yourself seriously, assuming the adult... with the questions, assuming that the adult in the room has the answer. And I'm the adult in the room. There're not two adults in the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah, hmm. (inaudible at 0:36:30). Why do I do that (laughing)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: I should answer as the adult in the room?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: No (chuckling), just someone who's farther away from my head. (Pause) Is it because I lack confidence and I'm insecure, or something else? [0:37:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: I'll answer that. I think there's a piece of it that's true, and I think there's a piece of you that is longing to be taken care of, that feels very sort of gypped of your childhood and that you want pieces of it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: I mean, that's not a good idea, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: It's a terrible idea. It's absolutely terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: And, I mean, it ruins relationships, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: It destroys them. Everything is purchased at a price, you know? So you get that, but there's a price that you pay. And everything is a trade off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: And I think you're aware that giving up on this... I mean, I don't know, I think adults can act childlike. I think we have childlike parts in us for sure. But giving up on these... or not even giving up but lessening your attachment to them... I don't think they go away. [0:38:02] I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D1\">you're aware of what you'd be giving up, and you're not sure it's worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2018C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559544\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: I'm not even sure if I understand (chuckling), like, being aware of being childlike. I'm not aware of it (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">THERAPIST: When you ask me questions like, what do you think? What is love? What is your feeling at the moment when you ask those questions (clearing throat)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">CLIENT: I don't know. Just curiosity, like, I want to know. I want to add to my knowledge. I want to know what your experience is. I want to see the world through your eyes. I don't know if that is childlike (chuckling). (Pause) [0:38:56] But yeah, other times, when I ask other questions, I do have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201931\">that feeling that I'm completely lost and help me, throw me a flashlight please, or just pull me out (chuckling). Maybe that's too needy and too unadultlike, when I can rely on my own eyes and ears to do the work. I mean, I feel like maybe it's not just childish. It's also like loneliness in the sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201932\">that yeah, I mean, I want to see it through your eyes. It's not necessarily about I don't trust my eyes. I just want to be part of yours, to be part of what you see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: So it's childhood loneliness, maybe (chuckling)? [0:39:58] (Pause) I mean, I guess I see that people, adults, they're more certain of themselves, and they know what they see. And they know how to evaluate it, and they don't ask that many questions. But I don't like some of that. I mean, I find <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201971\">the confidence and the ability to analyze sexy? But I don't think I necessarily like the idea of not asking any (ph) questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I was thinking about that, that children have a curiosity that I think is sometimes lost unfortunately in adulthood, a particular kind of openness to the world...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:40:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: That we call childlike because it's more prevalent in children, but I think it's something that is sort of very unfortunately lost. And I can appreciate why you would value that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: I mean, I value it as an artist but also in my... with my... Chris and I usually value that. We... his uncle, he's, like, 60-something years old, and he's very curious. He's an intellectual, and an activist. And he's very curious. He's always asking questions of young people about the world, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F1\">and... but, I mean, he doesn't come across as childlike (chuckling), and neither does Chris. But he really cultivates curiosity. So I just have to figure out how to cultivate it without coming across as a child (chuckling, sighing). (Pause) [0:42:00] Yeah, just... I don't want to be jaded and give the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F2\">impression that I have everything, that I've seen everything, that I don't want more. No thank you (chuckling). I'm very... yeah, I'm apprehensive of that kind of a stance. (Chuckling) I mean, it seems sexy enough. You shut your door, and you go in, and you're by yourself. But I feel like... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Cecelia (sp?), we're going to need to stop for today.
