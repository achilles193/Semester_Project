(Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">[0:19:00] [0:20:01] I started crying last night. Jeremy is working on a music track.

So I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200732\">to bed and sort of felt the weight of the longing for you (pause) and didn\u2019t think much of it. [0:21:03] But I just called Jeremy on his phone, and I was going to ask him\u2026 I don\u2019t even know, I think I was just going to ask him to come to bed one more time?

[I was wondering if you\u2019d find it interesting] (ph). [0:34:57] There\u2019s not any huge insights. It\u2019s just\u2026 (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: His name is Thomas Ogden, and I think the paper is called Three Forms of Thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll get it. (Pause) I used to read a lot about anything that came\u2026 it described what I felt about you? Five or six months ago I used to read a lot [to know] (ph).

[0:37:04] It can be hard to bear to let yourself really know some <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">things about what it\u2019s like. And that\u2019s one reason free associating can be helpful, is because, when you let your mind go like that and just say stuff that seems random or off topic or probably not connected or it\u2019s really not that important or kind of inappropriate or whatever\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It becomes clearer later how, without realizing it at the time, you\u2019ve said things kind of indirectly that you couldn\u2019t quite let yourself say directly. [0:38:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can do that.

[0:39:03] But I think we would probably hear more of what you have to say (inaudible at 0:39:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And also [congratulations.

Not you or me, but both of us and the whole thing is too distracting and seductive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s difficult to talk about what that\u2026 some of what that feels like. I mean, you do talk about what that feels like. But maybe there are some things that are also hard to say, and not the\u2026 maybe things you consciously decide are too uncomfortable to say. But I suspect it\u2019s much more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD1\">so things that are there but don\u2019t sort of get to the point where you\u2019re aware of them\u2026 [0:41:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: And aware of being uncomfortable about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re consciously withholding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:41:18)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m aware of there being a whole lot of space that\u2019s usually filled up with stuff when I\u2019m not here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right.

[0:43:07] Sort of like, sometimes when we start on rehearsals for the Afro (sp?) weekend, we were rehearsing in the pitch dark. That probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F71\">doesn\u2019t surprise you.

[0:43:57] I don\u2019t sit like this when someone\u2019s lying on the couch, because I usually face more that way. I have my notes open. I can see you and sometimes will turn.
