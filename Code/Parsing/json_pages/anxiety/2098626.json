Sorry about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: If they won, they would have played San Francisco and I would have been in San Francisco for my the Super Bowl, instead of at my grandma's 90th birthday party. So now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I guess you'll be there during the Super Bowl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, but they won't be in the Super Bowl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So I had a real slop (ph) day yesterday. Just stayed in my PJs and slept on the couch and watched the inauguration all day. And I went out to get Chinese food, which I threw up this morning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Nice, yeah. Which is probably a good thing, because I ate too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That's a pretty delayed throwing up. I mean, I know you, like, spit up some phlegm in the morning but usually you don't throw up, like, dinner in the morning, do you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Only when I order Chinese food, because I eat too much, so it's still in my stomach, you know, 12 hours later, 8 hours later, whatever. It's happened once before. And (ph) I woke up yesterday, I had no nausea whatsoever. So I was a little surprised because I figured I was dehydrated (yawns) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">from drinking. But I decided against taking the Adderall yesterday because that would have probably motivated me to do something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Wait, wait, wait. Back up. You decided (laughter) not to take the Adderall because had you taken it you would have felt like getting something done and you didn't want to feel like getting anything done so you didn't take it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Sort of. It's not that I didn't feel like getting anything done. I didn't feel like doing anything, you know. Kids...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: And you were worried you might start to feel like doing something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: If I took the Adderall, yeah. You know, like I'd go to the office and do something, you know, which I probably should have done. I'm going straight to the office from here. And I had motivated and made that decision before I took the Adderall. (pause) But I definitely can tell the difference. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">Not too long after taking it, like right now, from how I felt, you know, an hour ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Good, I'm glad it's helping. It could be really (inaudible at 03:44)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: You know, it's like I'm just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: ...different, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Am I just, you know, too tired and this is giving me energy or is it really helping my focus and stuff like that? I thought about something that (pause) I was able to focus on a little better. I can't remember what it was. (pause) I think Ian (sp?) was bothering me while I was trying to do something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">I can't remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">(silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I did want to see the kids yesterday though. I was going to text Jess to see if they went and see when they were going to get back but I never did. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: For the weekend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Just for..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: For the day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: ...for the day, yeah. Ian's (sp?) little friend moved. (phone rings) Jeez. They always call me when I can't take the call, you know, have to leave a message. And then when I did speak to them, you can't even remember the conversation. Like, nothing was accomplished, you know. So I kind of ended <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">up talking with Jess about what's going to happen with the house and she still suggested I move into the house and that she take my apartment, which now has one less room. I'm like, how are you going to fit in there, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098626\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: So is that your condo?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: No, that's the multi-family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Where she is now? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Right. What she wants to do is, because my rent's going down to $1200, she's not going to be able to get $1200 rent anywhere that isn't a slumlord or in a bad neighborhood. So she wants my $1200 rent, you know, and for me to move into the house that's getting foreclosed on or short stay alert <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">(ph). I don't know why she wants me to move there, you know, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Right. She just wants to cover her own ass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I've been dreading talking about it and it wasn't so bad, you know. Just about what we were going to do as far as selling, you know. And I said I was going to do something. Oh, see if they have an investment modification program. Maybe I'll call them today or tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: This is the bank?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

They're just so I don't even know what they're talking about. They're arguing over stuff and taking hot shots at each other. The disenfranchised trustee is, you know, both trustees gave me affidavits to what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">the finances were or at least Riley did the guy who jump sized. So she thinks that he should be brought up on perjury charges because he no longer supports the litigation. I don't want to explain to her that, you know, he didn't lie in the affidavit -he just doesn't want to enforce it, you know. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">really need to either go into some sort of mediation or hire their own lawyers and sit with each other individually. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">I mean, I have to figure out how to extract myself from this situation, you know. Riley has not been communicating to me at all about it. He just in one email said he no longer supports the litigation. And of course the email that I wrote out with our options. Luckily I didn't talk about our trial strategy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">but the disenfranchised woman ends up emailing it to the defendant. I am picking a trial date on Tuesday. We have a closing that morning. Probably not going to be able to meet with you on Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Which Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: This coming Tuesday, the 29th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: [About a week] (ph) from today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: So we're off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I'll know better today but I think I've got a closing that morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: OK, do you want to send me a message later today? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, if I remember. But I pick Ian (sp?) up today. Jess's taking some knitting class or something like that, you know. She complains that she has no time to get work done and she's so overwhelmed and, you know, I don't know. But taking a knitting class in the middle of the day? She takes all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">of Friday off with Lucille.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Wait, every week or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. They've got a (inaudible at 10:01) class at the school that they go to. She's been trying to apply for the preschool and get (pause) what's the word? They have a preschool program. I think they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: This one out there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Trying to get financial aid. (pause) (sighs) Yesterday was interesting because, you know, I felt crappy all day, you know, and it wasn't so much bummed about the game. I mean, I'm sure that affected my mood some but just, you know, felt lonely, nothing to do. Just, you know, (pause) I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098626\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">(silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: And I helped Ian (sp?) build his pinewood car, this car (ph) that I had no fucking clue what I'm doing. Went and bought some stickers for it (ph), numbers and flames and skulls and stuff like that, little decals. He has a bunch of paint but I don't think he has the right paint to, I don't know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">paint wood. I don't know. They kind of don't give you a whole lot of direction, you know. They're just like help you cut it and then they're just like, \"All right, the way in is,\" you know, whatever. So there's no, \"OK, here's what you need to do now\" or anything like that, you know. I don't think it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">[art time's leader] (ph) kind of a scatterbrain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: You really do the thing where you feel (inaudible at 13:04)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: There's not a clinical term for it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: There's some clinical terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I just wonder if this thing was official (ph) jargon or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: (laughter) You also do this other thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Back to the first thing I do. Sorry for interrupting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: The second thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: That's part of one of the symptoms of ADD, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you don't interrupt randomly. You interrupt specifically when I'm trying to tell you something. (laughter) I guess I think it's funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: So I do this thing. What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, where you feel you have this fantasy that you're completely helpless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Fantasy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. \"Oh my god, I have no fucking clue what I'm doing with the pinewood derby car. They don't give us much direction. The scout leader is kind of scatterbrained. I don't know if we have the paint to paint on wood. It's this Saturday, five days from now, whatever.\" I mean, there's this thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">called the Internet where people, you know. I mean, you could look up in 15 minutes sort of a detailed instruction, if you want, about what to do, I'm sure. Or figure out where to buy the paint or, you know, you could probably watch a video on YouTube showing you exactly what to do. And you don't need <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200892\">me to tell you this. Like, you've used Google and YouTube before. And part of you (ph) is like, \"Oh my god. I'm completely overwhelmed. I have no idea what to do. I have this responsibility that's way over my head. I completely can't handle it. It's only five days away. I'm going to let my kid down. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200893\">I'm anxious and confused.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">So it's, like, striking to me. (pause) Or you could ask one of the other parents. Or you could call the scout leader and ask him or her where to look. Or you could I mean, any one of those things would probably work. And again, I'm not saying this to, you know, I'm so smart, I have all these ideas. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">You could think of this (inaudible at 15:43) but (inaudible at 15:46).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">(silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: It wasn't about my anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I mean, clearly you are feeling anxious when you are feeling overwhelmed. Absolutely. In that sense it's your anxiety. I don't think you're actually (pause) I'm not sure that's really mostly what this is about. I'm not at all questioning how you feel. You know, do you feel overwhelmed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">do you feel anxious and do you feel helpless. I absolutely believe that you do.

I don't know. Is there something else? I'm not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Just kind of something beyond my comfort zone, you know.

At the same time, you're a smart, competent guy. You could probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">get pretty good instructions. It's (ph) a fucking pinewood derby car.

I'm sure Ian (sp?) is probably excited about how it looks <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">when it turns out. He feels mostly excited about just doing it with you, you know, (pause) and I'm sure if you, like good (ph) instructions, thought about it a little bit. I mean, 20 minutes or something before you get (inaudible at 19:22) and worked with him on it, that, you know, you'd do more than <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200992\">an adequate job. Maybe it wouldn't be the best one there or the fastest one or the best looking one but it would [probably be] (ph) fine.
