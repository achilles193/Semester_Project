[laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: Oh, wow. Yeah. I mean, I think that happens to a lot of people that know me, friends or whatever, you know, if they haven\u2019t\u2026 they know I\u2019m a writer, but then when they do read stuff I\u2019ve written I think it\u2019s a different\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m not one of those writers where I try to make like super colloquial, or like\u2026 I stylize it kind of, you know, but\u2026 But yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve never seen you so exciting in writing so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">THERAPIST: All of a sudden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

I even came up with\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t crystallize this before, but like for my Ph.D. I wrote to Walter and I was like\u2026 See, I kinda haven\u2019t known exactly what is my\u2026 the critical side of my\u2026 what the fuck am I writing about, trauma, the esthetic, I can\u2019t seem to coalesce it. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F1\">as I was writing the e-mails I was like, why don\u2019t I just write a fucking literary history of Assyrian-American literature? Has that really been written? No. The like chapters or this or that. Or the integrated into some other bigger\u2026 But there\u2019s just like a history of Assyrian-American poetry. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F2\">like, why the fuck didn\u2019t I simplify this before and just do this? It\u2019s like, yeah, a lot of it\u2019s not great poetry, but who cares, it\u2019s a legitimate literary history. I mean, you know. Anyway, so that simplifies that. I mean, as long as they\u2019re okay with it, which I think they will be. But that\u2019s much <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F3\">more straightforward, you have all the resources are readily available. It\u2019s not like a translation or\u2026 And it also doesn\u2019t force me to be overly like this dry academic. Like I can integrate this other stuff about trauma or whatever just into an interesting history.

Like that\u2019s not my strong suit, I can\u2019t take like one book by a poet and write a 60-page\u2026 it\u2019s just not in me. I feel like I\u2019m bullshitting, and I\u2019m just not saying anything really interesting I think after a couple pages. So I\u2019ll be good.

And there are so many articles now, even like studies now about how it fucks up with people\u2019s relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so destructive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s like what do you do though, like do you just not\u2026 It\u2019s like we all have to learn\u2026 It\u2019s like McDonalds or something, you have to learn, you know, \u201cOkay, I can eat McDonalds once a week, or once a month, but I can\u2019t every day nibble on\u2026\u201d And I\u2019m trying to do that, a lot of times <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB1\">I just don\u2019t\u2026 like it\u2019s not on my\u2026 You know, you have a bunch of tabs open?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not on there. Even if I log in, I\u2019ll just log in and log back out. I thought about deactivating it for a while. I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s just fooling yourself too.\u201d I\u2019m just going to log back on at some point. I mean, you know. So really I think it\u2019s just about mental toughness and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF1\">separating yourself from it. Just using it as a tool and then forgetting about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s the difference, of thinking of it as a tool, as opposed to kind of [unclear].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: [Mirror?], or this bullshit idea that it is a community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not a fucking community. Because then that\u2019s what communities are, right, gossiping, people talking about each other, who\u2019s popular, who\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a community, it\u2019s a bunch of whack jobs having a sandwich. Like it\u2019s all random complete haphazard nonsense being run by this like jackass <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C71\">dropout wizard. I mean, it\u2019s insane. I even read an article yesterday where unbelievably there was going to be a way initially, the idea was that when you log on to Facebook it would log you into everything, like all your other\u2026 it would be just a portal. But\u2026 [pause] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">And today my band, it\u2019s our last day at the practice space. I haven\u2019t seen my guys in quite a while. They want to get together and like kind of have a last practice or whatever, and I just can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not feeling that. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s too sad and weird, and I can\u2019t take it like light <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C91\">hearted, \u201cLet\u2019s just jam.\u201d You know, like. Because it\u2019s a bummer, you know, it\u2019s a real bummer. So I made up some excuse, and I was like, \u201cNo, maybe I\u2019ll meet you guys afterwards for a drink or something.\u201d Because what are we going to do, we\u2019re going to go through the set? And then it\u2019s like, \u201cSee ya.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C92\">Like, I just can\u2019t do it, it feels weird. I want to record before I leave, but that\u2019s different, because we\u2019re getting together for a specific outcome. But this kinda like symbolic last practice in the space and\u2026 you know, I don\u2019t like things like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562560\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And can you say [why you don\u2019t?]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t like it\u2019s a little bit pretend. It bothers me that I\u2019m having to break up this band, it bothers me that we didn\u2019t get to practice all these last few months, it bothers me that\u2026 especially with Stu. I found this one guy who I have such musical chemistry. And it bothers me that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD1\">kind of\u2026 you know, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to pick up at some point, but I can\u2019t count on that now, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. You know, it\u2019s just a bummer. So I don\u2019t want to go there and joke around and play and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] these are really, really hard feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: And I can\u2019t play while I\u2019m feeling that. I mean, that\u2019s a joyous\u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel right, you know. To me at least. I can meet them afterwards for a drink, because then it could be a little more\u2026 that\u2019s not a goodbye. I\u2019ll see them before I go to Assyria or whatever, but the practice space, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">me it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m just bummed about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you could say that to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: In some ways I did. I mean, I still\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s it\u2019s just so sad I can\u2019t bear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think I will at some point, but it was like I\u2019m already just\u2026 there\u2019s been so much\u2026 I kinda did, and I\u2026 like I made up some excuse. I mean, I also don\u2019t feel 100% great anyway. But I made up some kind of excuse. But then, yeah, I did say like I really miss you guys, like this has been <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD1\">such a hard few months. And, you know, I\u2019m just hoping that Assyria will reenergize me and at some point I\u2019ll be able to be here the way I want to be here, instead of the way it\u2019s kinda gone the last, you know, whatever. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s one of the great losses about this [unclear].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s like other than this and my really good friend, and, you know, family, whatever. But yeah, it\u2019s a good one. It\u2019s a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: But again, yeah, I just\u2026 it is kinda like this, where it\u2019s like I can\u2019t not go to Assyria, because I found this great guy [completely?], and he\u2019s not going to give up his job to\u2026 You know what I mean? Like what was going to be the end result of that anyway? It just it does feel good. Like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E51\">not like this, where this is practically leading, there\u2019s a practicality that I see tangible. You know, yeah, maybe we\u2019d record or whatever, but it\u2019s\u2026 It wasn\u2019t going to go much beyond. The only the way these guys would drop everything is if suddenly there was definitely money involved that they could <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E52\">live off of, and that\u2019s not\u2026 you know. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">So I don\u2019t know. What I\u2019m hoping is that with Stu, like things are so different now, there are so many musical projects of people that just send each other files, and you know, like things are so different that\u2026 you know, that would actually be fun. I can just him one song, he can send me back stuff, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">we could just kinda play around and just, you know. It\u2019s a way to not lose our connection. [14:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">And I was kinda serious with them that\u2026 I was like, \u201cIf you guys ever want to come to Assyria while I\u2019m there.\u201d I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t like doing one of those European tour things where you can barely break even. Like we will make money here. Like you\u2019ll go back at least with a few hundred bucks.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E91\">So if they really wanted to do that that would be pretty\u2026 It\u2019s a big\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t expect them to, but\u2026 Or even if like Stu was like, \u201cYeah, look it, I\u2019ll come there for a week and\u2026\u201d You know. But yeah, I just couldn\u2019t go there and like have beers and like jam. Like that\u2019s too bummed to do that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E92\">Yeah, it\u2019s just too sad to do that. [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562560\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">I e-mailed Diane to see if I can get my mom a cat, like Cecelia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And so you got Sophia one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, same one as I got. And matter of fact, it was weird, because Cecelia was an adult. Once in a while she has the breeders, the moms and the studs, or whatever the fuck they are, that she then\u2026 you can adopt them at a much less\u2026 you know, they\u2019re expensive cats, whatever. And I saw one that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">looks almost exactly like Cecelia, except he\u2019s a boy. So I don\u2019t know. My mom said she doesn\u2019t want one, but I feel bad about that too, I feel like my mom really loves Cecelia, you know, she really loves her. And I think it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m going to be gone, and this cute little\u2026 that was giving her a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF2\">joy. It just bums me out, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">So I might just get her one and just tell her, \u201cListen, if you really can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Because that\u2019s how Diane is, like she\u2019ll be like, \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle it, I will take the cat back.\u201d Like, \u201cDon\u2019t take it to\u2026 don\u2019t just give it to anybody, or take it to an adopt\u2026\u201d So I think I might do that. You know, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">300 bucks, whatever. Yeah, it\u2019s 300 bucks. But I think it\u2019s been really good for my mom. And I think she can totally take care of it. She says she can\u2019t, but you know. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: She just has a new one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, she\u2019s already\u2026 I\u2019m going, and she\u2019s being great about that. But then on top of that this little critter that, you know, like at least if she had that. And I feel bad that I can\u2019t leave Cecelia with her. I mean, not that I\u2026 I can, I won\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t want to. [pause] I don\u2019t know, I mean, so far it feels like a good\u2026 like it was good to get the kind of tumultuous stuff out of the way, the February. I don\u2019t know, like I\u2019m hoping\u2026 Like I feel more excited now, I feel like untying loose ends, I feel\u2026 I don\u2019t know.

You know, you\u2019re good at something. Like the best compliment I got today from <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202151\">a writer was about the one that you didn\u2019t\u2026 about this on the Penguin site. It\u2019s about one of my favorite\u2026 like he\u2019s really my favorite poet. He\u2019s like my\u2026 the one I\u2019ve learned from the most, and if anyone knows his work really well can see my kinda connections. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20219\">CLIENT: So what she said was she was like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d She was like, \u201cYou have a way of writing that\u2019s very touching but never ever cheesy or contrived somehow. And it\u2019s like, you know, so\u2026 And I get the same response to my music. So why would I kinda care anymore what\u2026 like I\u2019m obviously <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202191\">good at these things. It doesn\u2019t matter how good, or good as who else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021B\">THERAPIST: You are good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, you\u2019re good enough. Which I\u2019ve always said to myself, that there\u2019s got to be room for me in this world of poetry. But that\u2019s different just\u2026 like you said, just writing a post and fucking\u2026 Like even now, thinking about like my next book, it doesn\u2019t seem anymore like some kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D1\">of massive herculean\u2026 It just seems like just, you know, a month or two in a coffee shop and I\u2019m going to have a book. I mean, it\u2019s not rocket science. Luckily for me it\u2019s not. And I\u2019ve always said to a few people that if other poets knew\u2014musicians too\u2014if they knew how quickly I produce things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D2\">they everyone seems to like, and I did them in like 10 minutes or whatever, I\u2019d get my ass kicked for not being more whatever.

Like a working pretty finalized manuscript but then I\u2019m open to their edits or whatever. I think that\u2019s realistic. I mean, I have more than enough pages, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202291\">a lot of the\u2026 for me, I don\u2019t\u2026 they\u2019re not good enough for me yet.

I mean, it\u2019s definitely better than that first\u2026 you know, that first book to me is already kinda\u2026 it\u2019s a rush of like second avalanche of stuff that just came out. And I\u2019m proud of it. But this one feels very controlled, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2022D1\">like tight, and just\u2026 something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2022F\">THERAPIST: A different phase [overtalk].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20231\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And especially with all those long lines and\u2026 that\u2019s not\u2026 it just was an experiment that happened to work out. But yeah. And this one has a bigger theme, it\u2019s not just an Assyrian-American bullshit, like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202311\">got a much bigger kind of idea to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">THERAPIST: I can\u2019t wait to read it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">CLIENT: Me too.

And the only reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202351\">I say that is because if it\u2019s happening to them, I\u2019m no better than them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s going to happen to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">CLIENT: It\u2019s gonna happen to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Tenfold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So I think that\u2019s something that I\u2019m\u2026 And there\u2019s nothing you can do to prepare for that, the actual reality of it. Luckily <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D1\">again I think this writing, creativity, it just helps you to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">THERAPIST: What an outlet it will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">THERAPIST: From the moment you arrive you\u2019ll just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

For each one of them to be like, \u201cDude, you gotta brace yourself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202491\">because you get there and something just happens.\u201d Like you see that fucking mountain and just there\u2019s something.
