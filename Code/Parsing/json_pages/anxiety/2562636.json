Thank you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: (pause) I feel sort of like a slot machine in the sense that there\u2019s, like, a lot of things spinning where it could stop anywhere. Probably sure that\u2019s exactly the right place to stop. I don\u2019t think we win anything if we stop at the right place, but try. Certainly no money falls out. So I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">I\u2019ll try to just pull out some of the things and then see where we end up. I don\u2019t think this is important to talk very much about, but I\u2019m never quite sure what\u2019s important to tell you. So, Tanya and I had an intense conversation. She would call it a fight because that describes how she felt during <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">this weekend. Because I still don\u2019t have a job moving forward. Still being paid by my advisor. And the uncertainty of what will happen in the future is unsettling to her, which is fine, I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So I feel sad and anxious at this moment. And I\u2019m having a hard time, like, finding the things that I had intended to talk about or want to talk about. So it\u2019s \u2014 now I\u2019ve said that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Can you tell me about the sad anxious feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: So I feel sad. I don\u2019t know how to talk to you about it other than to say I feel sad. We\u2019ve had that part of this conversation a few times before. I think that\u2019s in some ways a response to being here and safe and all of that. Like, I\u2019m sad some percentage of the time anyway, but it\u2019s important <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">to do other things. So do other things. And I think the anxious is \u2014 is \u2014 I can think of two places that it\u2019s coming from, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on or if they\u2019re even relevant. One is that I feel like there are other things to do here also, but I\u2019m sad and so, I\u2019m, like, anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">about not getting to the things that are important to get to. As if the sadness itself weren\u2019t important in some way. And the other is \u2014 so we talked last week (chuckles) you sort of \u2014 you said very broadly, \u201cwell, you need to decide what you want.\u201d Which I appreciate the directness of that. Is correct, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">but, sorry \u2014 did you \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I was just clearing my throat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Sorry. But \u2014 and so, I\u2019ve thought a lot about that topic in the last week, but (chuckles) one of the things about desire for me is that I am anxious about talking about it, I think. So \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yes, what does it mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: What does it \u2014 when you said, \u201cI\u2019m anxious about talking about desire\u201d because what does desire mean to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. The answers to that are very complicated. The other sort of really interesting thing that you said last time that really stuck out last time, was something like, if I am going to maintain any commitment to commitment, I ought to get something out of that in the sense of, like, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">ought to be satisfied or pleased or content, or something positive in the doing of it. Which was, I thought, really interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I meant that very sincerely because to feel simply just imprisoned by your commitment is not really a great way to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. Thanks. But so, in thinking about both of those topics (inaudible at (00:08:15) so I sort of really was taken aback when you said that. So I think there\u2019s probably a whole lot more interesting implications to that, but I can\u2019t hit them all right now. So I think one of them is that I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">a general relationship with responsibility of that kind. Like, sometimes I get some satisfaction out of doing it, but (chuckles) you know, so on a performance evaluation, for example, you mark the box that says, \u201cmeets expectations.\u201d Well, I usually feel like I\u2019ve failed if that\u2019s the box that gets <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">checked. As opposed to, like, \u201cexceeds expectations.\u201d That seems problematic, I think, in this same sort of family of, well, we maybe ought to get satisfaction of doing the thing. That was \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562636\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Especially when the expectation is a great high expectation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It\u2019s made graduate school complicated. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: But I\u2019m actually thinking that there\u2019s a way in which that\u2019s a diversion from the point, in that, like, those are the things that I\u2019ve thought about some before that it relates to. But taking it as a more general sort of suggestion, it\u2019s been interesting in the context of desire and in terms <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">of doing the work that I have been doing in the last week. (inaudible at 00:10:44) if you\u2019re going to spend all your time doing it maybe you ought to enjoy it. But I do actually enjoy the work that I do. So it\u2019s been helpful to sort of, like, I don\u2019t know, monitor it in that way if that makes sense. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">Not everything I do I like. Like, I\u2019m not sure anyone has a job where they just do things they really enjoy. But I actually do really like what I do. So that seems good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes, also in a sense which that you have to decide what you want might really mean. You have to decide what you want more if the things that I want kind of conflict. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">And that gets into an area where I really struggle. I feel like, most people have some, like, straightforward access to their desires if that makes sense. But I feel like I have spent a lot of time not wanting to impose on people. As a result, like, suppressing or diverting that sort of first order <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">recognition of desire. And it actually seems to get more true, like, the more in crisis something is, so \u2014 and sometimes, like, the worse Tanya is, is usually the crisis that we\u2019re talking about. But it\u2019s, like, it would take a lot of work if I were going to a restaurant with several friends to, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">pick the restaurant. It would take a lot of work if I were asked what I wanted to do. Because I have a desire for everyone in the group to be satisfied by what we do and usually, I don\u2019t actually have very strong preferences about restaurants. And so, that sort of, like, well, just take mine more or <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">less out of it because I have this other desire for some sort of group satisfaction that is more easily met in a computationally reasonable amount of time we count fewer people\u2019s strong desires. So \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, even if you have sort of clear access to your desires, they might not sure everybody has just very clear access, it still doesn\u2019t mean those desires can conflict. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: And not that it\u2019s very important. Do you think that most people do or do not have clear access to their desires?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a complicated question. I don\u2019t exactly know how I\u2019d answer that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562636\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Okay. Do you feel like many people feel like they have direct access to their desires?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Okay, interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Maybe some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Interesting. Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Certainly not across the board in all areas of one\u2019s life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Interesting. Thanks. Well, yeah, that\u2019s right. And then it\u2019s their desires of, like, radically different kinds. How do you resolve that? In the relatively useless restaurant example, like, if I have a strong desire not to go to a particular type of restaurant that might come in conflict with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">my desire for the group to be happy if everyone else wants to go there. But if I\u2019m allergic to everything on the restaurant, then I\u2019d probably say I can\u2019t eat there. You know, that would feed back into everyone else\u2019s presumed desire to, like, eat with me. So, yeah, I \u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s an interesting example, because I think about it in the context of a cult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You know, where individual desires (inaudible at 00:16:36) under group desire. Presumably the individual desire is \u2014 corresponds with it and so, therefore, it\u2019s not a problem. Although one could argue that individual desire can be one\u2019s individual desire is always going to be somewhat different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">than a group regardless even if the values are very similar and so forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, and I think that the similarity between the group desire and the individual desire is actually part of the hook of the cult. So like, you want these things, we can give you these things. In some sense it costs you these other things, but \u2014 or you have to give up these other things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">in order to get these things. So \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, that sort of thing seems like a reasonable and interesting context to put it in. It\u2019s a little complicated because I was, you know, a young teenager when I left. So I don\u2019t have any real, like, adult exposure to that experience, but it was certainly formative. But it\u2019s also filtered through, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">like, or entangled with my parents and the \u2014 what I would guess, but I have no idea whether it\u2019s reasonable or not, relatively normal sense in which children\u2019s desires conflict with their parents desires. It seems something like the parents responsibility to sort out where that is, like, you know \u2014 <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">whether that conflict needs to give in one direction or the other. But actually, I\u2019d be interested in your feedback on what I just said because it is contextualized and I grew up in a cult, so I don\u2019t actually know how reasonable that description of parent\/child interaction is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: What part of it are you \u2014 would think might be different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Well, aside of the range of experiences people have is very different. That\u2019s not really \u2014 so I think the question of asking it, like, in a crude way is, like, how crazy are my parents? I think. How strange was my upbringing? Or like, was it bad in some way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: And it feels like an answer that I would have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I mean that (inaudible at 00:20:18). I know it sounds like a funny way to put it, but I actually wasn\u2019t meaning it as a joke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: A lot of things strike me as funny that aren\u2019t jokes. So \u2014 yeah, absolutely, it seems like an answer you might have. I was actually \u2014 I think that the reason I laughed is that right before you asked the question, I was sort of thinking if you did have an answer to that question, I don\u2019t expect <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">that you would give it. Because I would expect you to have an opinion on the subject, but not like a \u2014 like \u2014 it\u2019s sort of like, how could you possibly have a, like \u2014 have knowledge on the subject. Does that make sense? Like, without having been there, how can you know? Because I asked incredibly large, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">vague, ill posed questions. See, I expected you\u2019d have an opinion. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562636\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well, let me \u2014 there\u2019s a reason you asked that question. I mean, you think there\u2019s something brewing in your mind about asking that question about how crazy are your parents. It\u2019s a question you\u2019re posing to yourself too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: And in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, one reason that I think that I asked that question, I think, is that, you know, I had just asked you, like, how normal is this experience that I have? And you said, actually, it\u2019s very normal. And I was surprised by that. So it\u2019s sort of a \u2014 they\u2019re related in that way, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Right. So your questions are kind of revolving around some \u2014 trying to get some band of normality and then what are the outliers of that? Which sometimes I may have some doubts about, but these are also really hard questions. And also, I\u2019m largely interested in your experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Which I feel most attracts from getting some sort of scale. You know, staying with your experience seems like it would be deterred by talking about ranges. It gets away from, well, what is your experience, though? That there\u2019s a truth to your experience that maybe even supersedes any sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">of averages for lack of a better term. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Sure. Certainly my experience, though, is that, like \u2014 but \u2014 and so, this is actually that piece of the experience is heavily related to the context in which you brought it up, of, like, hey, you grew up in a cult, like, I\u2019m very aware of the ways of the fact that growing up in a cult colors <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">my experience and my sense of normal, and sometimes that\u2019s not a good thing. And so, I think that\u2019s really it here also. It\u2019s like, my experience of it was that it was just normal, like, and actually, not just normal, like, abnormal in the sense that not everyone obeys their parents, or believes that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200812\">parents should take responsibility for the actions of their children or anything like that. But I thought that was a good thing. So, my experience is very much one of, like, this is how it should be and how it is, and it\u2019s not perfect, but, like \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Did you \u2014 you mentioned a couple of things. But did you feel like they were, you know, aside from, like, the women being encouraged to have sex with the leader, that there were particular things that were really detrimental to people\u2019s wellbeing that was asking them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: At the time I didn\u2019t. I certainly do now. And so, as of, like \u2014 I actually don\u2019t have all of the \u2014 I thought very hard about this a couple of months ago. And I sort of left it aside in some ways, like, other things been going on and thinking about it. So, it\u2019s sort of, like, on a gross scale, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">I think that something has to be giving you a whole lot to be worth 10 or 15 percent of your income. Except they sort of \u2014 they expected 10 and, you know, you were supposed to give more. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562636\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: Right. So, that seems like \u2014 unless you\u2019re getting a whole lot back, that\u2019s potentially \u2014 (inaudible at 00:26:15).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: What did they do with the money? Did it go to the people in charge?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: It did, yeah. It went to \u2014 a key point, the headquarters of the cult and on a couple of other properties that they had that were used as, like, training for the next set of leadership. So it\u2019s like a campus in a sense. Separate from the main campus and so, as well as salaries for all of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D1\">staff. I mean, it\u2019s in some ways like the same things that donations to churches normally get too. But so, it wasn\u2019t like, you know, some of the more complicated televangelists, where they are millionaires personally. I don\u2019t think that was the case for any of the people in charge, which, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D2\">it sounded kind of interesting because I think they really believed it too. That sort of its own sort of kind of scary thing for me. It\u2019s like, there\u2019s definitely a plausible story in which the guy in charge really thought it was okay or, like, necessary and important for him to be sleeping with other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D3\">men\u2019s wives. Like \u2014 and that\u2019s a particular kind of disturbing. It\u2019s a little different from, like, I found this place of power and I\u2019m going to abuse it intentionally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, cause one is more sociopathic and one is more psychotic. They\u2019re both problematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Can you give me a \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Sociopathic is more kind of intentionally exploiting people. You know, knowing that what you\u2019re expecting \u2014 not really caring if it\u2019s right or wrong. That you want something and you exploit someone and it really doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s right or wrong. That\u2019s more sociopathic. Sort of a disregard <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">for the rules and disregard for other people\u2019s needs or treating them like objects. Whereas, this is good for, you know, having sex with married women. This is good for them, good for me. That\u2019s a psychotic fantasy. You know, it\u2019s divorced from reality. It\u2019s probably easily a lot of counter evidence <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">from reality, it\u2019s a delusion that is then embraced as reality. And it\u2019s not to exploit from the person\u2019s perspective cause that\u2019s \u2014 they feel, actually, that they\u2019re doing something good. You know, from the outside it seems very exploitive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Right. So, I think that is the \u2014 that\u2019s my guess as to what was going on, is that. I don\u2019t have any real way of knowing. But that particular \u2014 you\u2019re asking, like, did I think \u2014 do I think it was destructive? I think that\u2019s the kind of destructive it was. It encouraged beliefs about reality <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">that are obviously contrary to fact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Were they against education?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: No, not really. Which is weird, like, in a sense of like, they just, you know, thought they had a more correct story than people who knew more sometimes. But this was this other part of what they were doing is, like, one of the hooks was, like, the teaching you to do biblical research. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">is how you learn what is in the bible. So, it\u2019s tied up in education in some ways too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: But people like you, others went to public schools and (inaudible at 00:30:06) got education (inaudible at 00:30:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562636\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that wasn\u2019t discouraged. At least not that I know of (inaudible at 00:30:13). And since my parents got that pressure, I didn\u2019t know about it. I don\u2019t think that that was there. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: And so, I think that that\u2019s part of why I am sort of \u2014 part of why I\u2019m asking the, like, normalizing questions. It\u2019s like, does this experience from that set of people actually correspond any way to reality? Or to what \u2014 you know, I guess I trust you in your opinion to, like, what you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A11\">is reasonable also. And that\u2019s \u2014 I guess that\u2019s a tough place to put you in both, like, to ask your professional opinion and your personal opinion in a not very distinguished way. But that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I would say I don\u2019t have a strong opinion about it. And if I did I would share it with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: So do you have more questions in this direction or \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: No. I mean, I always do, I think, kind of not at the moment that it sort of really strikes me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Okay, then I\u2019m going to take this in a different direction. So it\u2019s been a while now, but you talked at one point about, in that series of conversations, in which I said I love you. But you talked about that being a tool for getting at desires potentially. So I guess I wanted to raise that note. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">And then, I actually wanted to tell you what my favorite television shows are. Because I think that that actually is really it in some way. So my two favorite television shows are \u201cBuffy, the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cVeronica Mars.\u201d Are you familiar with either show?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Familiar very \u2014 familiar with \u201cBuffy, the\u201d \u2014 I do not watch much TV. Familiar with (inaudible at 00:33:47).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: I deduced that. (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 was it Sarah Geller, is that Sarah Geller or something or other?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s (inaudible at 00:33:55).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s still not too much familiarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">CLIENT: Okay, that\u2019s fine. Actually, do you read books?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Um-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Sort of curious as to how you fill your time. Obviously, you do this, but \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re gauging time remaining?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sort of as a, like, I\u2019m situating myself. I seem to do that a lot. So I\u2019ll give you a brief synopsis of each of the shows because it seems like, you know, it was important enough for me to mention them as well. Follow through in that way. So Buffy is a young woman who is summoned by some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">\u2014 or becomes through some mystical occurrence that\u2019s never really explained, becomes the vampire slayer. So she\u2019s essentially like a 16 year old girl who\u2019s a super hero and is tasked with saving the world from vampires and demons, and all of the other evil things. And so, her struggle throughout the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">course of the show is one of, like, in some sense finding herself as this person who has these unusual abilities, but also wants to live in the world. And so, my friend, Franco, describes it as, like, her struggle with fate because she\u2019s had this thing imposed on her, and so she sort of struggles with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C33\">does she want it or not want it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">There\u2019s a sense in which the \u2014 this survey level description is actually not that helpful, but sort of \u2014 so I think, last week I said that one of the reasons I like watching well written television is sort of like, I like to watch other people grapple with difficult things to sort of see how they do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C51\">it. And that is a way of, like, processing how I respond to situations as well. So, it\u2019s a show that has a lot of dramatic or dire situations that the characters grapple with, some of which are, like, strikingly normal and some of which are very abnormal, but they\u2019re still people dealing with it. So, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C52\">that\u2019s \u2014 \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d is a television show about a girl who\u2019s the daughter of a sheriff in a small town in California and her best friend is murdered. And it\u2019s about her dealing with her best friend being murdered by solving the murder. So again, I\u2019m not sure that, like, that other (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C53\">00:37:57) description is like that helpful, but there\u2019s some (inaudible at 00:38:04) on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562636\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well, clear \u2014 matters and thoughts about how you describe the shows and why that you would like them. That, what are your thoughts about it? Aside from them being well written it sounds like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:38:33). I think they\u2019re authentically written in the sense that I think people have authentic experiences and I enjoy that. So, I identify with both characters. They\u2019re both, like, young and very evil in some way. And (inaudible at 00:38:48) that\u2019s both a good thing and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">a bad thing. It\u2019s a thing they have to deal with, and it\u2019s a thing they also, like, experience good things as a result of (inaudible at 00:38:59). I think that\u2019s one main draw that sort of, I\u2019m actually more curious in your response to my descriptions. So, it\u2019s sort of like, I\u2019ve thought a lot about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C92\">why I like the shows and I guess I \u2014 but not thought a lot about how to describe why I like the shows to someone who\u2019s not seen the shows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Well, certainly what (inaudible at 00:39:38) I imagine there\u2019s other layers too, but on the most obvious layer it seems to describe what you feel. You know, not that you feel you\u2019re a super hero, but that you have abilities, that you need to use those abilities to help others and to be able <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">to understand things. And that maybe that, in a sense, conflicts with other things that you might want to do. And that your level to commit and help out isn\u2019t obviously what you want. And so, the interesting sort of the \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a twist, but, like, with Buffy, it sounds like is this really <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB2\">her or is this something imposed upon her? Is this truly in her character, or is it something that she\u2019s sort of almost trapped by that maybe she would actually want to be liberated from? It\u2019s not clear it sounds like in the show. So, it\u2019s not clear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s really interesting. Yeah. So certainly over the course of the show, she, like, comes to accept and own it. She grows into it in some sense. And there\u2019s a one in particular episode where she thinks it\u2019s gone away. Where in her response to that is essentially, like, who am I if I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD1\">this? Which is a very interesting \u2014 cause it\u2019s like, she has not been this person for 16 years and then this is like, two years after she\u2019s \u2014 but it\u2019s become a very integral part of her identity. So, that\u2019s the answer for the character. I don\u2019t know (inaudible at 00:41:28).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: I can see so many parallels (inaudible at 00:41:32). I mean, you very much identify this is not quite \u2014 you very much identify with yourself as a person who adheres to commitment and sticks \u2014 you know, has a very high and specific moral code. And you\u2019re identified with that person and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">identity. And so, then doing something different, if you think about it, does that mean you\u2019re a different person than who you thought you were?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200CE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562636\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that\u2019s a very powerful insight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">THERAPIST: To put it on a more positive spin is, do you want to evolve and change? You know, even if it\u2019s different, does that \u2014 have you just not revealed your true character, or do people change over time? And the one thing about a cult that I think is, you know, there\u2019s several things that are problematic. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D31\">But there\u2019s (inaudible at 00:42:45) a static motion of people. There\u2019s no development or evolution. Even though the cult often has the psyche that it\u2019s evolving and expanding (inaudible at 00:42:54). But individuals don\u2019t grow and evolve and expand in that. That\u2019s not the point of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s so true. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And so (inaudible at 00:43:08) good thing. You could just change. Your values change. Your desires change. Your interests change as you develop and grow and encounter situations you haven\u2019t encountered before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: So do you have a clear sense of what I ought to do here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Un-un, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t know that I really expected you to. But you could say some of the things you\u2019re saying, like, as a, like \u2014 as guiding me in a particular direction or just in, you know, guiding or helping guide, or helping sort out what is going on. Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, this is probably too strong a statement. And I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m that committed to it. But I feel like that would almost be cult like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">THERAPIST: A) and also, what decisions you make, most notably about your marriage, but we\u2019re talking about a lot of things, but certainly, your marriage is the more kind of conspicuous one. I feel like it\u2019s an important decision in itself, and there\u2019s some things that will be constants in either decision. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E31\">But there\u2019s also just making that decision and feeling good about it. That it\u2019s not the actual decision you make, but it\u2019s the process you go through and then the sort of the health of that process that points to a decision that feels like a healthy decision for you through a healthy \u2014 I\u2019m using the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E32\">word \u201chealthy\u201d (inaudible at 00:44:58).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: You know, that coming to that decision in a good way is \u2014 such as, I am going to stay with Tanya because I feel imprisoned by my commitments. That\u2019s a bad way to come to a decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">(laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not necessarily a bad decision, but if that\u2019s how you arrive at the decision, that\u2019s problematic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: Right. And this is \u2014 this seems like it\u2019s very much bounded by the context of, like, making longer term decisions, as opposed to, like, making your decision in a moment. So, like, a contrast to that is, like, when training for anything, like, often one wants to quit, like, while one is in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">intense moment of it. But that would actually be a bad reason to stop doing it. So \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:46:16) need to stop.
