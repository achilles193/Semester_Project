It\u2019s like the simplest way to connect.

It\u2019s much easier to be in the chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">But it started like strong observations about my body. Like it\u2019s hard to relax when I\u2026not that I\u2019m good about silence, body tension, anxiety, separation; like all of those go with each other, I think. Worried that at the end of the session; like that\u2019s the worst on Monday or Tuesday. So it\u2019s kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">a [inaudible \u2013 04:09].

Somehow like that didn\u2019t happen at all. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">I think it\u2019s nice that I\u2019m doing it because I think it brings stuff up that wouldn\u2019t come up if I used the couch all the time because I used to would like suffer in silence. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: And you sound concerned there that I might not think it\u2019s a good idea, which I think you must be worried that I wouldn\u2019t understand how anxious and, in a way like sort of debilitated you would feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: If you didn\u2019t understand or if I were to use the couch?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: If I were to object or recommend that you don\u2019t sit in the chair but use the couch, that it would feel like I was missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, it would. But honestly, if you were to say that, which you wouldn\u2019t, I would\u2026I don\u2019t think I would have any problems feeling sorry. That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to be through the time that it feels like it\u2019s right because I think it\u2019s useful.

That\u2019s a blow up. I\u2019ll go ahead one potential one last time. And I\u2019m happy you\u2019re getting to see this side, but it feels really different. Like what are we doing here? What\u2019s important? [Pause.] I\u2019m mad that you\u2019re not a dad with flexibility <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">or a husband with flexibility in your work schedule. I\u2019m also mad that I\u2019m not special enough for you to say, well, if it were any other patient; well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s like it\u2019s I almost want you to make an exception with me. Like should understand or like\u2026I don\u2019t know.

And I\u2019m also not getting that you would not only, in a way be fine with my saying I have to leave for this reason, but you feel like I was treating you respectfully or even an almost kind of special way knowing you would understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">[13:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019m oblivious about that too.

[Pause.] And I\u2019m oblivious about, I think, like why you want to sit in the chair and the fact that you\u2019d be able to like assert with me that you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I don\u2019t think that you would say anything about what you think I should do. Because I sat in a myriad of places in the chair and you didn\u2019t say anything about that. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: I thought so because you seem to me like you were making like a bit of an argument to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not because I wouldn\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right. It\u2019s because that maybe you were thinking in your head like, hmm, hmm.

What are you doing here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I mean that seems like the stronger, like the thing you had stronger feelings about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">[16:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: My being here rather than the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t; it wouldn\u2019t like I\u2019d be left. I think I underestimate how sad that would be in that moment I pushed that away. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Which maybe is also a bit who you\u2019re pushing away sitting in the chair?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: The one who\u2019d be sad to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and who feels like bad and out of sorts after the longer break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: Uh huh. And before the longer breaks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah, two breaks. Yeah.

I\u2019m so glad he joined the lab. Just so [inaudible \u2013 17:56]. He\u2019s like simple and easy guy. He\u2019s just like; he has this like huge grin on his face whenever he sees me. And like other times, and he wants to know like all about\u2026he\u2019s just very curious to be just like so mild mannered <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">and so lovely to be around. And he\u2019s got this like, I have a sister side that a lot of men and boys have. Like my brother has it. Where you just like talk to them for two minutes and you\u2019re like you totally understand women. You just got it. I don\u2019t know why that has anything to do with having a sister, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200992\">but over time I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s always, almost always true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">So Albi was asking me what it was like for me to be sitting in the chair of the people who are listening to my talk on Friday, which are the students who are entering during the coming like programs. So about like 50% of them get in. So it\u2019s like their recruiting weekend\/interview weekend. And Albi <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">was there. I gave a talk last year at the same time and he was sitting there being in the class recruited, and he was telling me how he was so interested; like he was so like unbelievably nervous like beyond anything he\u2019d ever thought before. He asked me what it was like for me over five years ago. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B2\">He was like were you really nervous back then? I said I wasn\u2019t nervous. He\u2019s like, oh yeah, Vassar got the [inaudible \u2013 20:10] No it didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">[20:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">But anyway, I wasn\u2019t nervous, but I was very positively anxious. So I know we talked for a little while about like when I hear the word nervous, I think like really sick feeling. Like kind of negative anxiety. Like I can\u2019t do it. Like this is so big. This is so overwhelming. This kind of thing. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">like I\u2019m so small. And how I felt, for whatever reason, that weekend. I was just like so bright, wide-eyed, and bright-eyed. And I don\u2019t know; it was like performing. It\u2019s probably not hard for you to imagine what it was like that weekend. I was like at a really heightened state of performing anxiety, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F2\">like harvesting people left and right. And feeling very very very that like sensitive blissful confidence that I can have when I like ignore a bunch of stuff. But that\u2019s what it was like. I was excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">[21:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">I wasn\u2019t like feeling really bad, but I was feeling really, like, excited and anxious. It\u2019s like, you were like anxious. I was like yeah. I said like a couple of sentences like, I wasn\u2019t really aware of it until it was about a year and a half ago and then I started to have a pretty big crisis and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">has taught me a lot and I\u2019ve since incorporated ways to look at and cope with my anxiety. And it\u2019s there and it\u2019s big. He was like, but you\u2019re so put together all the time. I hear this over and over again. And I think are they like the people who actually know me, like my dad and Jeremy who I do feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A32\">[inaudible \u2013 22:26] getting back to [inaudible \u2013 22:29].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">That\u2019s like one time going like happened to have like two really spacey men in my life. But then there\u2019s like a lot of people just like who come and go who have this impression of me I\u2019m really put together. And often it feels simplistic, one dimensional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">Tracy said the same thing about me a couple of days ago.

There\u2019s all this stuff that happens that\u2019s [inaudible \u2013 29:45]. Maybe at school concerts or school plays. But I imagine there\u2019s some stuff. I worry about how you do it. If you do it and how you do it. The hospital thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201151\">comes after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah.

But I hear only the slightest bit, but I imagine that there\u2019s\u2026but it\u2019s a hard thing to balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: So I\u2019m not saying that Emily is only slightly irritated. I\u2019m just saying that I don\u2019t hear. So it\u2019s like yeah. You know, like why Bob isn\u2019t staying the extra two days in Vermont. And it\u2019s like, \u201cBob\u2019s got to go back to work on Monday. Bob has to work on Monday.\u201d And like, I just\u2026I guess I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">like a\u2026I wonder a lot about like what that\u2019s like for your family and how you manage it and whether you\u2019re doing it badly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: But you have moments you\u2019re [inaudible \u2013 31:34].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Like today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: But you know, it didn\u2019t really occur to me that it\u2019s not your family that\u2019s in the hospital. It could not be. And it doesn\u2019t occur to me that you show up for important stuff. Somehow that\u2019s, or like it occurs a lot later. That you probably... are devoted and why you are here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">[32:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">Somehow it\u2019s like a lot easier to go to the alarmist and go [inaudible \u2013 32:30]. Like an alarmist fear of you being neglectful of the job. Like an alarmist view of you being neglectful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: Right. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: So what made you say that it seems to you like people are oblivious of me? [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: I had in mind oblivious of the more anxious, more upset, more sort of fragile feeling part of you. Does that answer your question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: Not really, but it helps. And it also brings up like my mom\u2019s refrain around how badly I was standing around at my wedding. I don\u2019t know, as soon as you said that I started hearing her voice. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t know. You seemed fine. We didn\u2019t know.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">[34:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know if you told me about her saying that in particular, though, you probably have. But I remember things like that and I was also thinking of how you, I mean I think I know a person pretty well, but this has changed, I think, quite a lot how you have been oblivious at times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah, my answer to her every time it\u2019s come up and I think that\u2019s only because it hasn\u2019t come up that recently. In the past, since the wedding, my answer to her has been, \u201cMom, I didn\u2019t know either.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that you could have known. I didn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2013C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562114\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">Also, like I think, more behind, what\u2019s behind that more is that I don\u2019t want her to feel badly not so much that it\u2019s important that she know that I didn\u2019t know because like; I mean at some point I knew really strongly that something was feeling very, very, very, very wrong. And that was not; I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F1\">not oblivious of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like, but you still like go to sleep and wake up the next morning and live your life. And it\u2019s just hard for me to convey to anyone how traumatic of a switch it was. So it\u2019s like, okay, like I didn\u2019t know some things, but I definitely knew some other things and the fact that you didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201431\">know kind of\u2026I think it really like stifled my ability to understand and cope, respond in like any way at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: So, I think I resent her a little bit for that. And maybe [inaudible \u2013 37:17] because I notice that I like tried pretty hard to make [inaudible \u2013 37:20]. I don\u2019t expect that she should have known because I didn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s like if you had known, that would have been way easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Or if you had known anything about yourself\u2026or like I had some reference for like how one moves through something bad. That would have been easier too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">[38:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">Wow, snarky at me and critical of your mother on the same day.

Times, they are a changing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: [Laughs.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: I figured out this guy\u2019s docile and I was reading a book about his anxiety. And it was reviewed in the New York Times and The New Yorker a lot this past week. And in the article, something that was like formulated in a way that was really nice to read because I had been thinking about it for <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201571\">a long time in a lot of different ways. I hadn\u2019t really known like how to say it. So it was nice to read somebody else\u2019s words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">So because naturally I wondered like where my anxiety comes from. And like why it made itself apparent to me when it did and like why in particular ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">[40:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: And since I had managed anxiety in just about every other person I ever met, so\u2026it seems pretty [inaudible \u2013 40:18] and I wonder why it\u2019s there. And the article split it in to three theories\u2026yeah, three theories. One being like this sort of psychoanalytic unconscious drive thing which adjusts, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F1\">but the anxiety can be shifted or relieved or changed in some way. It\u2019s older, or unconscious conflicts are made conscious and dealt with. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: Umm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: I mean I\u2019m paraphrasing it. I realize, [inaudible \u2013 41:35] I do. So that\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s what I understand to be like the theory of anxiety, but that\u2019s broken irrelevant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">CLIENT: Well, I guess, the author doesn\u2019t say psychoanalytic [inaudible \u2013 42:01]. So it would be nice to hear what you think about that. It\u2019s very relevant to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">THERAPIST: Okay. I can just tell you. It\u2019s very short. Anxiety is a response to an internal danger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">CLIENT: Uh huh. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a super [inaudible \u2013 42:35] or what I read the article said?

It seems very vague to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: I know. Yeah, he said a little more about it. I didn\u2019t\u2026None of the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: In the initial, [inaudible \u2013 43:13] anxiety was that when drives, which mean like basic things with sex drive and an aggressive drive weren\u2019t being, and the aggressive drive is complicated, but basically. And his real idea was that when they were kind of damned up and not being expressed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201751\">anxiety resulted. And his later theory was that no, in fact, that was sort of backwards that the relation between the drives and the anxiety was that the drives involved wishes that aroused sort of internal fears. Like the wishes were for things that were not okay. And that made them scary. And that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201752\">where anxiety came from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">[44:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: I think he didn\u2019t get that part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: And I think he even sort of later non-drive theorized, but he probably skipped, basically, like that piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: Like I respond to our wishes, unconscious or conscious, or our sort of dream reaction to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Well, but like you\u2019re afraid of getting eaten by a ravaging lion. That\u2019s fear. If you\u2019re afraid that a\u2026 [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: An example that involved [inaudible \u2013 45:15].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking is when in [inaudible \u2013 45:19] such an example. You know what we\u2019re talking about is essentially like your separation anxiety. Coming up around the wedding, a big wedding. So, you could say they were talking\u2026the people like, though you are more eager and excited to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201831\">get married, the, in your head, the space, like the distance that put between you and your parents made you very anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: And I think that wasn\u2019t okay. It\u2019s like there is no room for\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">[46:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: And then there\u2019s a second problem, I think. You think you\u2019re feeling kind of anxious and kind of overwhelmed and your internal parents don\u2019t leave much room for that, whereas your external ones often don\u2019t either. But they didn\u2019t even get that far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Because you aren\u2019t aware of it. In other words, you couldn\u2019t let yourself be aware of it because internally, they don\u2019t need any space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">CLIENT: Uh huh, and somehow like what they leave space or don\u2019t leave space for is more important than when I leave space for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">THERAPIST: I mean in as much as they\u2019re your internal parents, they\u2019re also you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that theory about anxiety would suggest that people have, well, I don\u2019t know. Do people have one sort of type of wish, like one general group of wishes that make them anxious? Who\u2019s fear of, make them anxious, over and over and over again in their life? Or is it like wishes come and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201931\">they go and they keep being scary and there keeps being not enough space for them? [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: Sorry. I was distracted by that thought. But I mean, let me say it again.

Usually it turns it on. But then I saw this old man in his wheelchair covered in blankets. He was homeless. He was being taken off in an ambulance on a stretcher. Then I turned the \u201cDo not disturb\u201d off. I hadn\u2019t talked to my grandfather-in-law until today. I called him <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A71\">and talked to him [inaudible \u2013 50:22]. Like in the lobby of this building. And I put the \u201cDo not disturb\u201d back on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">Meditation practice is going. And he said that he\u2019s having some feelings of helplessness. Some old wounds are coming open. And I encouraged him; just encouraged him. And said this is a secret [inaudible \u2013 51:14]. [Pause.] We talked about, sometimes he\u2019s like not so [inaudible \u2013 51:40.] He was like making <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A91\">all these associations to me. Like the little puppy and kids are throwing stones at him. The puppies die. I think that was in the [inaudible \u2013 51:54]; he has a [inaudible \u2013 51:55]. Then he said in the [kite runners \u2013 51:57], this woman was being convicted of adultery and she\u2019s so helpless and she can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A92\">do anything about it and she knows that she\u2019s [inaudible \u2013 52:07]. He like kept talking about those two things.

[Pause.] And we talked about compassion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: So, sorry I brought up your phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Um.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: One wish.

It\u2019s that my impression was that it conveyed it as that I didn\u2019t understand that actually really you wanted to be here and talk to me right now. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: [inaudible \u2013 53:45].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: I was worried that I would like be still on the phone when I walked in here because it\u2019s like you said good-bye and we had to say good-bye like three or four more times. I think it\u2019s called Jewish, actually, so don\u2019t slap me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not.

So yeah, I didn\u2019t expect to be on the phone, but I was on the phone and I just started like, I don\u2019t know; I had that pause about like what I wanted to walk in on the phone and just I decided not to. And then you asked about it. [inaudible \u2013 55:19].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">The other theory in the article is that anxiety is a response to some like existential problem that humans, all grapple with. You know like what is our purpose? Why are we here? And nothing is really evolved, with no self, whatever. And that seems like kind of not completely irrelevant either to me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C51\">But I think their theory was evolutionary. I think we have this fight or flight response. It hasn\u2019t been selected against and it\u2019s still there and it\u2019s just like there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. It\u2019s\u2026and it\u2019s like something that\u2019s no longer\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: Oh, like a vestige?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like a\u2026it\u2019s not adaptive in the present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: But also hasn\u2019t been selected against.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve only heard that idea come up in the context of like vestige or [inaudible \u2013 57:03].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: But yes, exactly. There\u2019s a similar theory about auto-immune diseases. Kind of like the hygiene hypothesis, which is like we\u2019ve evolved to protect against home and foreign diseases. There\u2019s like a whole nother arm that, I think is TH2 arm of immunity that is important for worms and then the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D51\">bacteria and virus immunity is TH1. That\u2019s like another set of cells, molecules. The TH2 type of immunity is people think that that\u2019s what it\u2019s in over drives in many cases on immunity. But like there is this inappropriate response to self.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562114\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Like trying to remain healthy worms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re trying to remain healthy worms?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">CLIENT: Like we\u2019re; if we had worms to fight, that immune, part of our immune system would be educated and wouldn\u2019t act inappropriately against ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">CLIENT: It was like this whole cool, this very cool like process, like exposure educating your immune system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">[58:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like we just don\u2019t see worms, but there are lots of like self\u2026I know people aren\u2019t clear on like a lot of this. But it\u2019s like the TH2 response is like a vestige of earlier times. And it\u2019s causing a lot of trouble in the case of in like modern times people are like more, oh he\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E71\">[inaudible \u2013 59:11] and asthma and you know, a little bit Type I Diabetes and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Arthritis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">CLIENT: Arthritis, yeah. So one theory is like if you give people worm treatment, which like they\u2019ve tried in Crohn\u2019s disease, which is another case we can find too exhausting to [inaudible \u2013 59:47] to be. It seems to help in isolated cases. But I don\u2019t know it well enough, I don\u2019t think. I think there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB1\">too much more to it.

Like one, so like maybe for me, like in my whole life anxiety will come up in the context of separation anxiety. Or is it just like this is what\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">[1:00:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">THERAPIST: This is a very small number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Maybe, but it\u2019s got like displaced in to everything.

[Pause.] And that part, I also don\u2019t mean like anything blaming in on or anything specific. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD1\">It just means like me knowing myself and what makes me anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.

Probably; like maybe it works for some big chunk of your life and then you have to do it all over again. Or not being [inaudible \u2013 1:04:47]. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only reason to be in therapy. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what people do.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021D\">CLIENT: I would like have figured out some way to talk about it with other people with some other way to talk about it with other people or some other way to really to, but like talking about with yourself all the time isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not like working at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2021F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20221\">CLIENT: Or at least I think it brings up lots of stuff that [inaudible \u2013 1:10]. And the time it\u2019s like, and where is your journey. Like, for me, it\u2019s like why aren\u2019t you coming home. [inaudible \u2013 1:11].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20223\">THERAPIST: I assume you mean the part like when you ask that like that kind of makes you feel bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20225\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t actually directly ask that. I\u2019m not sure. [Pause.] [inaudible \u2013 1:11:52]. But, I mean it comes down, it\u2019s kind of like a [inaudible \u2013 1:12:04] that she; I\u2019m talking about how like when my brother, who\u2019s friends are like going to graduate school in the fall this year, how like for <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202251\">couples, have got a time in their life, if not the future often brings up stuff about how, like hard stuff in a relationship. And [inaudible \u2013 1:14:09] hard to do but it, I don\u2019t know. When you come to a juncture, you come to a juncture. And I was saying like, and there are some people who think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202252\">the future like way too much in their relationships. [inaudible \u2013 1:14:35] children, and a house. And my mom is like I\u2019m like that, and that\u2019s why I never dated anyone. [inaudible \u2013 1:14:48] talked about dating. Because I would always, I would probably always wonder or knew I always wonder where is <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202253\">this going? Are we going to get married? And I just like didn\u2019t waste my time if I didn\u2019t know that it was going to end in marriage. Why do it? I asked, do you think that\u2019s the only reason to go on a date? And I was like, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a waste of time. It was a waste of time for me. She was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202254\">very careful to say that for her it felt like that it wasn\u2019t going to work because she would be too worried about the future. I was like maybe there\u2019s another way of saying that is that you really didn\u2019t want to get hurt by anyone. I\u2019m like once, more, it\u2019s a waste of time. No, I wonder if you like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202255\">just are missing a whole part of that of how much pain there is when relationships end. It was sort of like, yeah. That was satisfying. Because I\u2019ve always viewed the difference in between how my mom approached dating and through her and how I approach dating to be like an inferior. Like mom and more <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202256\">whatever, more discipline, more highest, not to self, better, saving yourself, whatever it is. More care.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20224-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20224-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562114\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20227\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20229\">CLIENT: And now I feel so differently about. Like oh, like I didn\u2019t fear being hurt enough to not engage with people [inaudible \u2013 1:17:20].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022B\">And it wasn\u2019t really her family culture; it wasn\u2019t American [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022D\">[1:18:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, I mean I can see that there\u2019s a superiority there and it\u2019s a waste of time and how for me to meet. But they\u2019re true also a little [inaudible \u2013 1:18:47].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20231\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s similar like [inaudible \u2013 1:19:01] have sex and they sleep in the same bed when they\u2019re together or sleep over each other\u2019s apartment. And I like, wasn\u2019t that tactful and maybe I should have been there. I don\u2019t feel badly about it. But since Maggie, I had stay over, I [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202311\">\u2013 1:19:23]. Like yeah, she was there. Maybe like rub it with, it\u2019s going to say something different if you ask him. But I\u2019m not going to lie to you. I would be lying to you. She was like well, we don\u2019t pretend. We don\u2019t like pretend. If it doesn\u2019t happen you just ask that it not happen in our house <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202312\">out of respect. And I was like respect of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20233\">THERAPIST: [Laughing.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20235\">CLIENT: And she was like respect of what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20237\">THERAPIST: [Laughs.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20239\">CLIENT: And she was like respect of marriage. I was like things are making more sense. Like that\u2019s the only way that you think is the best way, like the only way you think two people can respect marriage is if they don\u2019t sleep in the same bed before. I was like how about this? How about we don\u2019t sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202391\">in the same bed at your house because you guys are really important me respecting you. And I thought okay. I never respected that role because it had anything to do with marriage; I respected it because of you guys. That\u2019s probably where it\u2019s coming from too. There are lots of ways to respect marriage. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202392\">That don\u2019t have to do with sex. But that one was hard. That one did not fly or like rest. Like the dating thing felt like\u2026I don\u2019t think I got anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023B\">[1:21:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023D\">She was like yeah. I can see that. [Pause.] They are very worried that Maggie and [inaudible \u2013 1:22:12] will hurt. Like one of them will hurt the other. [Pause.] But their attitude at the end comes from [inaudible \u2013 1:22:38].
