And so that reminded me of the first year I fasted for the holiday. I was 13 or 14, something like that. Maybe I was 12, I don't remember really. Which reminded me of my dad and how he's not fasting this year because he's just been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">too frail all year and he can't. Which is you know, sad and scary and just deeply upsetting to him that he can't fast this year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">Which led me to the very morbid thought and like anxiety spiral of, dad has made it very clear that when he dies he doesn't want to be buried in the U.S. He wants to be buried in Nepal. And he wants to be buried according to religious burial law, which means burial within 24 hours of death. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">And so I just, I got trapped in the anxiety with both how on earth would we manage the logistics of that?
