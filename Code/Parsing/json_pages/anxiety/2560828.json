I was with my friends last night and I\u2019m at a point right now where I\u2019m constantly checking the balance to see if things cleared or whatever. I knew that I was playing with fire. I just wanted to buy my friend a beer and, of course, I saw that it was negative. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">We went to a diner and honestly I was going to cry in the diner. I was sitting there, it\u2019s fucking cold, it\u2019s late, and I\u2019m like, \u201cMy God. There\u2019s nothing I can do. There\u2019s just nothing I can do.\u201d  So they were like, \u201cDude, don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ve got it.\u201d But I just couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">anything so they ordered Buffalo fingers and I couldn\u2019t even eat them. They tasted like shit. Then I woke up at like 5:00 with crazy heartburn. I just woke up in a panic attack. I felt like shit and then my mind started racing. \u201cSee \u2013 it\u2019s happening. You\u2019re going to have a heart attack. This is what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">happens. You\u2019re so stressed about money. It\u2019s going to give you a heart attack.\u201d I just derailed. I didn\u2019t take an Ativan, so that\u2019s good. Somehow I fell back asleep. I just kept getting up and now it\u2019s like what am I going to do? I\u2019ve got to tell my mom. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s fucking insane.  (long pause) (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">I worry what\u2019s going to be that different going to Assyria? Nothing is perfect. Things are expensive there, too. It\u2019s the worst kind of claustrophobia. That\u2019s an irrational kind of thing. Obviously it is better to not have car insurance and a lot of things, expenses, that I\u2019m not going to have \u2013 a job <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">and all that stuff and rental income. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Something sets off something inside. In this case it sounds like you\u2019re seeing a negative balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Because in this case this is the first time with no unemployment. This is it. It\u2019s not like something is going to happen next week. This is it. I don\u2019t have words. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this in my life. (pause)  I\u2019m like I should just sell my car, I guess. Sell it. It\u2019s not worth <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">much now, but $1,000 or something, whatever it is. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: So the balance made it feel more real [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:23)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course. You see it in black and white and you know that nothing is coming. (pause) I\u2019m just very, very sick of this instability situation. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, but this is not working.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Does something then change though about how you\u2019re seeing Assyria and your plan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Only in the sense that it adds to the reality of how am I even going to get there? It deflates the pleasantness of going, being excited like hey, I\u2019m going. This doesn\u2019t help me feel that. It just makes me feel like now I\u2019m desperately going. Do you know what I mean? Now I desperately need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">somehow need to borrow money to go to fucking Assyria. Like I said, it\u2019s one thing to pleasantly plan and just put the ticket on your credit card. It\u2019s not even a question.  That\u2019s very, very different than borrowing, worrying about every nickel. And then what ends up happening is that it doesn\u2019t seem <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">real. Now Assyria, in a way, doesn\u2019t seem real. Do you know what I mean? If you don\u2019t have the money to go . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560828\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: It seems like yes, I know that I can go. I know that I can borrow the money tomorrow and go. It just doesn\u2019t sit well. Something just doesn\u2019t sit well with that. It\u2019s probably just in the moment I\u2019m just upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: I think so. This is not how you were feeling yesterday about going to Assyria. You were much more excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: It\u2019s also that we had a conversation in the car. That was the other thing. My friend, who is from Libya, and my other friend who\u2019s visiting from Assyria, they were both saying two things at the same time \u2013 not the one from Libya as much, but my friend from Assyria. On the one hand, he\u2019s saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">it\u2019s going to be awesome for me. On the other hand, he can\u2019t wait to get the fuck out of there and there are a lot of things that he just really doesn\u2019t like, so it\u2019s like that\u2019s not making me feel that great.  He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, you can save money.\u201d But then he\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect their either. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200232\">Things are expensive.\u201d Wait a minute \u2013 what is it? (chuckles) That didn\u2019t help either. It\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, I\u2019m broke, I eat disgusting chicken fingers. I\u2019m just like what is happening? I tried to keep my wits. I was like, \u201cWell, no. Of course nothing is perfect, but clearly there are $500 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200233\">rent is $500 rent. A job is a job. Paying me American dollars. Not having car insurance is not having car insurance. Paying $20 for wireless Internet instead of $70 or whatever the fuck it is, that\u2019s a big deal.  That\u2019s got to mean something.\u201d He was like, \u201cNo, no. You can save some money.\u201d (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200234\">Which is it? Also I was like, \u201cDude, you have two little children and a wife and you guys are living on whatever you\u2019re getting paid and you said you\u2019re saving money. I\u2019m a dude without kids.\u201d I was trying to differentiate. I was like, \u201cAnd also you\u2019ve been there 12 years. Your time is just maybe up.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: What else was he complaining about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: A lot of people are super annoying. Customer service is really bad. You walk into a restaurant and they\u2019re like, \u201cYes?\u201d Do you know what I mean? There is no \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going? What can I do for you?\u201d Nothing like that. They\u2019re just like \u201cUgh. Customer.\u201d And very blunt, weird. So what, in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">a way? I was like, \u201cDude. Look around you. Have you seen what this country is living?\u201d People are rude. Once in a while they are very nice and then that redeems your faith in humanity for a while and then some other asshole is rude. (chuckles) That\u2019s the way it goes. So I think he\u2019s just done. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">for him it\u2019s hard to be completely positive and that\u2019s different. I can understand that. Twelve fucking years. I\u2019ll be happy if I can be there for a year and be very happy or whatever. That didn\u2019t make me feel so great. I was like man, so we\u2019re fucked. Nowhere is perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: But of course nowhere is perfect. If that\u2019s what you were expecting . . . It didn\u2019t sound like you were even expecting that yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: No, I didn\u2019t, but I felt like they were pooh-poohing on it a little bit, while at the same time telling me that it\u2019s a great idea. I was like, \u201cI get all that, what you guys are saying, but clearly the lifestyle is different. Clearly there is something going on there, right?  There is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">that people keep moving and you stayed there 12 years. Yes, I know that you would have come back three years ago if you had found some amazing job here, but the fact is that you\u2019ve made it work and you\u2019ve saved some money. You come to Darien twice a fucking year with children and a wife. Clearly something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">is okay.\u201d I\u2019m not letting it get to me; I\u2019m saying it felt like family. I was like, \u201cDude, I already have a negative bank account. I just ate disgusting chicken fingers that I didn\u2019t even want that I just said yes to because I feel embarrassed.\u201d I would have had a club sandwich or something, but at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">first I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d They knew, obviously, that I was being shy or whatever. So I was like, \u201cDude, I don\u2019t want to hear this now at 2:30 in the morning when I already feel like shit. I need to hear . . . \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560828\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: This being positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Of course \u2013 because who cares? It might be awful, but I \u2018m going to turn around and come right back and be here where I started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Even the idea of it just being awful, it sounds like there is a continuum that\u2019s either really, really good or really, really bad and I think that reduces the complexity of it down to like . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: No, no. I\u2019m saying like worst case, if I went there and I found that they were right and it is all this about it and I just can\u2019t handle it . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: But what if it is all that and you have a great job that pays you money and you\u2019re . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s my point. That\u2019s what I was telling them. It\u2019s a life. It\u2019s personality. These guys \u2013 we\u2019re all different. I tried to tell them, \u201cDude, you\u2019re a dad. You\u2019ve got kids. You\u2019ve got a wife. You\u2019ve been there twelve years.\u201d Our personalities are slightly different. He\u2019s a curmudgeon. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">He\u2019s always been that way so of course shit annoys him.  Shit annoys me, but I somehow don\u2019t let that stop me from interacting with people, from being upbeat with people. If I need to fake it, I fake it. Whatever. But it doesn\u2019t stop me from engaging with life. He just gets annoyed and angry, like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200372\">little George Costanza.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: So a piece of what could be happening if he\u2019s reminding you of your family is that you get a little triggered about feeling the way you feel about your family. It sounds a little bit like it knocks you off your confidence, in a sense, and what you know about why you\u2019re going. You\u2019re not just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">going because you\u2019re idealizing that it\u2019s going to be perfect people. If you were sitting here the day before you would not have said that was even the aim. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Why does everyone think I\u2019ve never been to Assyria? I already know the people are annoying. There are Assyrians here from Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Exactly. And even if why you\u2019re going is to experience the hardship or the way the culture is curmudgeonly [and suffer it] (ph?), that\u2019s part of why you wanted to go to Assyria. Not for it to be perfect only, but to experience it \u2013 whatever it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. I told him that it\u2019s not like in Berlin people are skipping down the street.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: No. Or here!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Anywhere. That\u2019s what I said. Some people are nice. Some people are douchebags. Some people are kind of cold. I was like, \u201cMaybe it gets to you more because you\u2019re Assyrian, so that just rubs you the wrong way. Why are these other Assyrians that way? I\u2019m too selfish for that. I\u2019m selfish enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">that I don\u2019t give a shit. I am no Nationalistic \u2013 I do not give a fuck. I\u2019m proud of my heritage, but I\u2019m not one of these rah-rah-rah, this president \u2013 they all suck.  I don\u2019t fucking give a shit, so to me it\u2019s more like individual interactions. The good ones are good and the bad ones are bad, just like here.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560828\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: I think even if you hated the people, you\u2019re going because you have a job. You\u2019re going to experience it for the good, the bad, and the ugly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what he said, too. He was like, \u201cDude, the thing is you\u2019re going to work at the university so you\u2019re going to deal with the cream of the crop people. All the Assyrians you\u2019re going to deal with have worked super hard. Unfortunately, it\u2019s because they want to get the fuck out of Assyria. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">But regardless, in your interactions they\u2019re going to be bright people. They\u2019re prepared. They\u2019ve worked hard to be at the school and all that.\u201d Obviously the other professors and admin are probably going to be more or less just like here \u2013 interesting people or whatever. I think in some ways it\u2019s more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">like he was venting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it wasn\u2019t about you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: It was him and my other friend. They were both venting a little bit, one about Beirut and one about [Yerevan] (ph?) I understand. I get it. In a way they just kept contradicting. My other friend I just felt like saying, \u201cBut dude, that\u2019s where you\u2019re selling your paintings, in that region. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">get it. I get that you don\u2019t like that it\u2019s very noisy in Beirut or that businesses don\u2019t do legit.\u201d What\u2019s the government in Libya at this point? It\u2019s basically Hezbollah. They\u2019re not doing the IRS stuff. It\u2019s just like an organized chaos. Businesses will ask you if you want the legitimate receipt <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">or do you want the simple receipt for taxes? Yes that\u2019s annoying, but really? (laughs) Who the fuck cares? I kind of like that actually. That\u2019s the whole point. I\u2019m drawn to places that still have these grey areas.  That\u2019s where possibility happens, where you\u2019re not getting fucking steamrolled by \u201cNope, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B3\">it\u2019s got to be like this. Done. See ya.\u201d That there are these wiggles; people find ways to make things happen because they have to. It\u2019s not ideal. I don\u2019t want to live in Beirut, but it\u2019s pretty awesome, kind of. I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s where you meet interesting people, right? That\u2019s where your art is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B4\">happening.\u201d It\u2019s happening because there is a real sub-culture, a real Bohemian, intellectual, artistic class that\u2019s not like here. That\u2019s why it\u2019s happening. That\u2019s got to be worth something.

You\u2019re lost as you\u2019re talking about it today, that you were even thinking \u201cI go there, build my credentials, get <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">experience,\u201d maybe finish your doctorate because you have time, write more because you might be more . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: That stuff goes out the window when I get into these moments because it feels like this is how it\u2019s always been somehow.

I don\u2019t have two nickels to rub together and I can\u2019t go out and complain about that because I don\u2019t want to do that. It\u2019s a date and we want to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">a great time. I\u2019m not feeling it.

(chuckles) I hate this shit. I get into a very self-protective mode, like I\u2019ve said before. I just want to be home or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200532\">I just want to be with my Assyrian friends and I can\u2019t. (pause)  I feel bad. (sighs) (pause) That makes sense though, right?

I know I will, but I think part of it is just temporary \u2013 and I get that. I think the bigger thing that does bum me out is that it\u2019s temporary, but at the same time there is a reality of I\u2019m not that financially independent. I\u2019m done with that. I cannot take it anymore. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F1\">why I feel like I don\u2019t want it to be, but going to Assyria feels very loaded in that way.

You\u2019re coming back here to a family that already thinks that you\u2019re always changing your mind. I don\u2019t know this exactly, but it\u2019s so easy to read them. This guy is not serious about anything. You have to pick something and just do it. Whatever. He\u2019s artsy-fartsy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">He\u2019s idealistic.

In other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">words, somehow it wasn\u2019t a nightmare, but I wasn\u2019t Chris Rock. I was just doing this monologue-type thing. It was really weird. Really weird.

I wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they . . ?\u201d It was weird. At one point I left and I was like, \u201cOh, you guys are still here. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d (chuckles) I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">through the curtains and was like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Weird.

I\u2019ve been doing this for years. I started off . . . \u201c (laughs) I don\u2019t even know what the fuck I was saying. There were times I was saying \u201cIs it me or is it Steve Martin?\u201d Like am I watching Steve Martin do it?

I love stand-up comedy. Good stand-up comics I think are so great and they really are, for me at least, I can be in the shittiest mood but if I watch some of my favorite stand-ups, I will laugh. I think that\u2019s such <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">an amazing gift.  Just standing up there with a microphone. That\u2019s crazy. Maybe it\u2019s just having some balls to get up there like, \u201cYep. I\u2019m doing this whether you\u2019re laughing or not.\u201d I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: We were talking yesterday about the painful history of having no recognition \u2013 no audience, to see, to admire, to laugh at funny jokes, see your art \u2013 and how that makes your confidence even holding onto what you want to do and that this is the right thing to do very fragile. The dream, though, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200791\">is a little more confident, ironically; uncertain still, but no backing down. (pause)  Where did you go? What are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m thinking about canceling on the chick. I was thinking about having to talk to my mom. Just stuff. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: She doesn\u2019t know the unemployment is cut off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: She knows, but we always kind of do this thing where I just won\u2019t talk to her unless I absolutely have to because I can\u2019t fucking handle it. I probably shouldn\u2019t do that. I probably should just be up-front like, \u201cLook, this is what\u2019s going to happen. There\u2019s no question that I\u2019m going to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F1\">negative because how could I not? There are things that are going to be paid or are automatic withdrawals. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s going to go negative, so we have to try to figure something out, at least temporarily.\u201d I don\u2019t do that because I just cannot deal with her.  She\u2019ll ask me if I need money <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F2\">or whatever, but then I\u2019m already so aggravated that she even has to ask me that, that I\u2019ll either say yes and she\u2019ll give me $40 or something. It\u2019s this very \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to call it. She knows that I need more than that, but either she doesn\u2019t have it or . . . it\u2019s just a bad situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Does she have it or you don\u2019t know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Her finances fluctuate, too, because when the rent comes in and the pension comes in, she does and she doesn\u2019t because she has fallen behind on some bills as well. It\u2019s very hand-to-mouth. So no, she doesn\u2019t have it in the sense that she can give me hundreds of dollars every week.  There is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">no question that I have to ask my . . . because unless this week they change this unemployment thing, there\u2019s no way. I don\u2019t know how or I\u2019d have to call my car insurance and cancel it and just stop driving just to start trying to . . . (pause) Or something bigger, like she would have to dip into her <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200832\">. . . She has a very small retirement account. That\u2019s like \u2013 really? That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now?

I don\u2019t want to feel guilty because you didn\u2019t take my advice with some of that money. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">didn\u2019t have to happen, this whole situation. It just didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t like to think about that, so all this stuff just kind of comes in because she handles it so badly and that it doesn\u2019t help the situation. It\u2019s just not good. (pause) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s insane. It\u2019s insane to have a three-family home <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200872\">in Cheshire and this is the situation you\u2019re in.  It\u2019s mind-boggling, but I\u2019ve tried to think of different ways make it work. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: Selling your car sounds like it could get you through. You might have to borrow a little money to buy a ticket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Again, the issue is all of these things make me feel like there is some kind of desperation in what\u2019s going on \u2013 and that\u2019s what just doesn\u2019t sit well with me. I\u2019m not excited. Right now I don\u2019t feel excitement about going to Assyria. Maybe I will when I get there, I guess, but this doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">feel like I\u2019m able to plan it out properly l because I need a big chunk of money to get a ticket, to feel like when I get there I have some money to last me.  I\u2019m having trouble. There are two different things going on. I\u2019m sure once I get there \u2013 yeah, I\u2019m sure things will be okay, but this is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B2\">the way I wanted to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not, but it\u2019s what\u2019s happening.

Is that per week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: The unemployment? It was $412 per week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: $412 per week. It\u2019s a swing and it cuts you off and it\u2019s horribly inconvenient, but it\u2019s not the forces against you and there is still how do you then start to plan what has to happen in order to get over there? It was your plan before this. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. I get all that. Like I said, it somehow feels like a symbolic \u201cdon\u2019t let the door hit your ass on the way out\u201d kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019re getting kicked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: A little bit. A little bit. What I don\u2019t like about it is, and it\u2019s a totally ridiculous, narcissistic type of thing, but I just feel like I created this fucking opportunity for myself. I created that opportunity, so I\u2019m excited about it \u2013 and yet I can\u2019t go with just a nice, smooth plan. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">what really . . . and I feel like that never happens for me. I don\u2019t want to think that, but I can\u2019t help it. I feel like I never just get a nice . . . Let\u2019s just plan. Oh, cool. I found this ticket. I bought it. Yeah, cool. It doesn\u2019t have to be a lot of money, but I never feel like things get done <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B2\">in a calm, upbeat way.  That\u2019s what I\u2019m sick of.

In that way nothing in me is saying \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d to Assyria.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560828\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And one job in its own way was too good to be true. What was happening was that you could work for just a few hours a week and be paid for full time. That\u2019s not going to last. I don\u2019t care what country you\u2019re in, eventually that falls apart. If you\u2019re working 40 hours a week maybe that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B91\">a different story. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">CLIENT: Right. It was too good to be true. I\u2019m saying let\u2019s say I was working \u2013 it was a hard-core, difficult job, whatever. I\u2019m just saying the salaries that I\u2019m going to be getting around here has, to me, become a bigger question now of so what? In this city, I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re making $40 <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB1\">$50,000. Secretaries at Yale are making $40 $50,000 a year or whatever \u2013 admin assistants \u2013 and they\u2019re living with roommates. We\u2019re living in a part of the country that it\u2019s not cutting it any more. You need to really have your financial shit together here big time to be able to take a little vacation <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB2\">sometimes, to be able to say it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got like $10,000 in the bank. Every month I put this much in. Yes, I can put $20 in the bank.  There\u2019s always a way to save; I get that. But again that\u2019s like I\u2019m saving it so that when I\u2019m 65 I can have $5,000 or something? Living is right now and you do <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB3\">have to be practical. You do have to do whatever you can to save and cut corners, but Jesus Christ. This is not working for me. (pause) Two-twenty? All right. Thanks. Have a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
