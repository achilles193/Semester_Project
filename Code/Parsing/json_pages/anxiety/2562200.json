Nothing ever gets finished. Things just kind of lead to not knowing what to do.  I\u2019ve always got to be pushed to do something, but then expect to still do everything else. I guess I\u2019m feeling kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">of frustrated and tired of having to remember all these things I need to.  (pause) I can never have a relaxed day. Between doing experiments, answering e-mails, doing analysis or talking to people to try to figure things out, it\u2019s always hectic. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I guess I wonder whether a lot of the stress and pressure come from not just how much you have to do \u2013 which I know is a lot \u2013 but from your worry about whether you\u2019re going to get it right and the other people involved are doing what they need to do right and it\u2019s good enough and it\u2019s timely <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">enough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) If someone needs something or comes to me with something and needs my help, I\u2019d rather do it right away than put it off because I\u2019ll forget; there are too many things to remember. So I guess I\u2019m always rushed or feel like let\u2019s do it now or that I should.  (pause) It\u2019s just hard <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">because I feel like I want [to be able to slow down] (ph?) and I want more time to do things, but I\u2019m always in a rush to get things done so I have energy and motivation to do anything.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: So you want to make hay while the sun shines kind of thing \u2013 get it done while you\u2019re thinking about it; get it done while you have enough energy to do it; get it done while you\u2019re motivated to do it \u2013 stuff like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Right.  (long pause)  I guess even talking about it now I\u2019m fed up with it. I just kind of want to deal with it or get as much of it done as I can for the day until I\u2019m tired and it\u2019s time to go home. That\u2019s what it feels like. It\u2019s just kind of like (inaudible at 00:09:52). (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: When you say you\u2019re fed up with it, you mean fed up with working in this way? Do you mean fed up with talking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I think I mean talking about it \u2013 [the feeling, though.] (ph?) It\u2019s the dread or anxiety when I go home I remember what I didn\u2019t do or didn\u2019t get to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It does occur to me that talking in here is different and maybe the opposite of the kind of thing you\u2019re describing, where it\u2019s not like stuff comes up and we work hard on it and resolve it in that moment and then it\u2019s done and it\u2019s on to the next thing.  It\u2019s a lot of keeping things open <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">or up in the air, which then, as I guess is happening now, brings up the feelings around the worry or the dread, which like at work, you\u2019re actually working very hard and conscientiously to remove.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Right.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: One question, it seems to me, and the reasons are not clear, is why the anxiety and dread are so strong.  I understand, to some extent, there are practical consequences to not getting your work done at work and it matters to get it done, and to get it done relatively quickly and well. Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">you disagree, but it seems to me that you tend to feel anxiety and dread about getting stuff done at work that is really pretty intense.  I guess my sense is that there is kind of a snowball effect. I don\u2019t think you worry that if you don\u2019t get something done today or something that you\u2019re going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">get fired; but I think you probably do worry that if you don\u2019t get something done today, then it\u2019s going to put you behind tomorrow, which is going to make it harder to do these three other things and it\u2019s going to kind of cascade. And that you\u2019re going to come apart as a result and not be able to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F3\">well.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562200\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: It almost seems like the nature of job is doing things for other people and processing samples and sending them or processing them and giving them back to them or giving them data or doing analysis. I guess I just feel there are a lot of things to remember and I want to get them done and process <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">them so I can be kind of finished.  I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s for other people and dealing with other people. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: I think that makes sense to me, but in this other complicated way, in that what I think you\u2019re worried about there is getting into something that is sticky and confusing and anxious and upsetting with the person.  In other words, it\u2019s the kind of thing that we talked about where, if you don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">get something done the way or in the timeframe that somebody wants it, then it becomes a conflict with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: So defending myself, it\u2019s kind of like I should have. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: I think it may feel different. I mean I think that\u2019s one aspect of it, but what often happens when you describe situations like that at work, is part of the feeling is that the other person is critical and you\u2019re defenseless. But then it often seems to change to where it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">being unreasonable in some way and they\u2019re kind of oblivious.  Then I think it gets hard to know which view is right; and I think that\u2019s the situation that I think you really dread all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I just either want to remove myself from it or I\u2019m just super critical of myself. I want to try to do it better. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: The way that it starts to come up a little bit between you and me, where I think \u2013 and maybe I have this wrong \u2013 sometimes you feel like this is just kind of awful to talk about and just makes it worse. Or I say that maybe there are things we can learn from it or whatever, and it\u2019s unclear <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">whether there is something wrong with me and I just don\u2019t understand, or there is something wrong with you and you\u2019re supposed to be able to fix this or work through it and there is some way that you can\u2019t. But it gets difficult or dreadful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s kind of like I don\u2019t want this problem and I just allow this and I am angry towards myself because there is a problem and this is happening. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: What are you referring to specifically when you say . . . What are you identifying as the problem? [Maybe if we talked at] (ph?) different levels or from different angles about what the problem is, and I\u2019m wondering what you have in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: It explodes into everything. I\u2019m not . . .  Yeah, it\u2019s just kind of everything, like I don\u2019t work hard enough or I\u2019m lazy or not thinking about this critically.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562200\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t look this way often from the outside, but do you have a kind of internal tantrum when this happens, where you just get fed up and furious with yourself and sort of explode? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah, like everything is the matter and all my problems are because of these reasons. (long pause)  I guess it just feels like I\u2019m always the problem. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really very painful (inaudible at 00:28:43). I think you\u2019re pretty clear that when this happens you feel not like you have a problem, but that you are the problem and it\u2019s inherent and unfixable and incredibly frustrating.  You get terribly angry at yourself for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I feel like as much as I work or I try, it just keeps getting worse or more convoluted over time.  I can try to be strict, but it just doesn\u2019t work or it doesn\u2019t stick. (long pause)  I guess there is a feeling of wanting to leave or bow out or something, but I always sort of come back in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Leave or bow out of here now, or do you mean out of this issue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: I just have the feeling like maybe I shouldn\u2019t do this job or like I shouldn\u2019t be in science or I shouldn\u2019t . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I guess that\u2019s another feature of this, that you tend to want to look outside of yourself when you feel this way, I think because looking inside feels so incredibly frightening and bad and overwhelming. You either so don\u2019t want to go into it yourself or become so overwhelmed. (pause)  It <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">must feel, in some way, like I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re handling this wrong or you\u2019re doing this wrong. I\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s what I think, but I do think it feels that way to you. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: I guess maybe because it\u2019s like this discussion brings these feelings out. Maybe that\u2019s why I feel like I should work on them or I\u2019m just being unreasonable.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Being unreasonable by . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Being this way or allowing myself to be so (inaudible at 00:37:01) or not being more together. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:37:28) it sort of starts, in a way, with my finding you unacceptable, which I also suspect would feel like I just really don\u2019t understand how overwhelming and how disorienting and disturbing thinking about these things is.  I guess it\u2019s like I can\u2019t understand how that throws <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">you more than it tends to help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: I guess my ideals and resolves, like we said earlier, are to fix it and go on from there. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like I don\u2019t get that that would just be a better way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that you don\u2019t get it, it\u2019s just not what you want with this.

And you want to go about it another way which, for some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">reason, doesn\u2019t seem tenable to me.
