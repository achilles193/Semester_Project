Oh well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: I guess the first thing that crossed my mind about it is that you'd be concerned about something being different the night you left the hospital or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes, I mean I am concerned about it.

Okay. Okay, I kind of have three alternatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: One is that you're worried that I'm going to say you can't come in or not as much or this isn't working or I've had enough or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Another is you're going to say I don't want to come in, I've had enough, this isn't working, something like that. And the third is, remember what we said on Thursday? I don't know how much you remember but I had a thought sort of halfway as we were talking and more fully I think after that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">I think it can feel very bad to you sometimes if somebody says something maybe moving forward or in a way getting better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">And more with the way in which I was saying that on Thursday, like there was another way in which I was not saying that or which I was not saying that I don't think things aren't getting better, and some ways in which I thought they might be. And I guess I wondered I just sort of talked about it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">I know you knew, sort of you wanted to know what I meant and did mean, that maybe you'd react bad in some way or feel like I really don't understand what this is like or that you would be feeling misunderstood and real mad if I was suggesting that in any way things might be moving forward. Sorry, these <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">are the three alternatives I can think of. And I don't know if any of them relate to your being anxious. Do you notice that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Not really. No, it makes sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: You want me to [inaudible at 00:09:17]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Well, sorry, that I sorry.

None of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yes, sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: You're incredibly anxious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I think you're having a terrible time collecting your thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Is this something that you're feeling physically or otherwise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: No, I just sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: Would it help to go onto something else? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: I'm sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: Would it help to go onto something else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Maybe, if I were if I sorry.

Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I don't think I've seen you this anxious about me here before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Do you know why that is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don't know that I've been this anxious about it. Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: And it seems like it started so far it seems like it's kind of unconscious anxiety in a sense that if you were coming in here aware of being worried about a particular thing, like this isn't true but you said you couldn't meet tomorrow morning that means you probably never want to meet <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">ever again, so I'm a little anxious about that even though I know that's probably not true. That's a little more conscious in a way. But it seems like it's really unclear what's making you this anxious today. It's something about being here. Is it do I have that right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Seems like it must be. I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yes. It's really hard to think anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: And even a few weeks ago, I don't know what you remember about the [little scenarios] (ph) but you were very quiet here. But I'm pretty sure you even told me about being very worried because it wasn't feeling super anxious, you just sort of didn't know what to say.

And so then a few weeks ago it was like you don't seem to be really feeling anxious or bad feelings, etc. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: All right.

My inclination would be to say I'm happy to schedule a 3:45 and then if they keep you there for more than 3-1\/2 hours or something then we'll cancel. I won't charge you then. Unlikely and I don't think I'll feel bad but anyway yes, that looks like that's fine with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098846\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And Wednesday morning I guess it should happen at 7:45, which would probably be before the partial started anyway, even if you're in that day.

Starting next week I'm having some time with people starting at the end of the week. I really would stay open tomorrow. And I imagine the hours <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD2\">would be something like 9:00 to 3:00, that's usually what they are.
