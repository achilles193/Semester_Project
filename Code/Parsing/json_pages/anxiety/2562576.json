If it was in the past, I would go into full-fledged panic attacks and I\u2019d be taking Ativans. Yesterday I actually got a lot done, a lot of errands and stuff, changed my air filter when my heater got fixed. I went <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">to Home Depot and did that. It sucks and also I don\u2019t know why I was feeling a little constipated or whatever. I think about the back thing, one day this week I met up with that friend of mine and we kind of did stuff in the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: That will do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. She was very aggressive. It was great, but I didn\u2019t think at the time that that is probably not very comfortable. Whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not \u201cwhatever,\u201d though, when it\u2019s something so relatively benign. It\u2019s certainly annoying to have a sore muscle and then you get into where it\u2019s something much worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: The one thing I will say is I always feel weird tightness back there and I always feel kind of bloated. But even that, of course I do. My whole back is probably one concrete slab and I\u2019ve never been great with posture. That\u2019s something only the last couple of years I\u2019ve tried to be better about. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">There is that and then diet, whatever, not drinking enough water.  I\u2019ve been guzzling water now just because I think \u2013 you know \u2013 so things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I had a crazy dream last night about Cecelia. Unbelievable \u2013 dreaming about a goddamned cat, but it was (chuckling) really sad. It was both beautiful and sad. I was on some crazy, beautiful island or something and I was looking for \u2013 do you know who Isabelle Huppert is? She\u2019s a French actress. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">She\u2019s probably 50 or 60.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: A contemporary actress? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes, she\u2019s alive and \u2013 you know \u2013 she\u2019s French. She always does these kind of whacky films. There is always something weirdly sexual or whatever. I don\u2019t know why she was in the dream. And it wasn\u2019t sexual. I was like I\u2019m going to find her and talk to her. I was going to ask her advice or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">like that. It was this beautiful island. And then I somehow realized that I had either lost Cecelia or I thought the cat I had in my arms is actually not Cecelia, so it was crazy. I freaked out and was looking all over for her. Then I thought I had found her, but it wasn\u2019t her. (laughs) Oh, man. In <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">the dream I was trying to rouse her. She\u2019s a pet; what can you do? If she\u2019s gone, she\u2019s gone and there are a lot of other cute cats that need love. I don\u2019t know; I was trying to rationalize it. I think, in the end, I found her, but I know that when I woke up I was so happy that she was lying right there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">(laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Why are you laughing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It was just funny. I literally kind of laughed when I woke up. I was like wow, a crazy dream about a pet. It wasn\u2019t funny, it was just kind of crazy. I don\u2019t see dreams like that about people that often. I\u2019m also laughing because it felt good. It was such a relief that she was there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Even if the place where it\u2019s starting is with the animal and not a human, it\u2019s a dream about a specific and unique attachment to one critter who isn\u2019t replaceable like \u201coh, just get another cat.\u201d Like women or there are other girls. The bond you have is with her. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562576\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: I get why people who have pets don\u2019t immediately get another dog or get another cat. They usually wait a little bit. It\u2019s understandable. You\u2019re so attached.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: But these are the feelings that you can\u2019t imagine having for a girl or for a woman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019ve had those feelings, just for the wrong . . . I felt that way about Samantha, obviously, big time. (pause) And in some ways I have it for my friends. I do. I don\u2019t know why I was trying to find Isabelle Huppert (laughing). I haven\u2019t seen her in a movie for quite a while and I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">what advice I wanted to ask her, but whatever it was, it was a beautiful place, kind of like a rugged island type thing. Rocky, but not scary. And in a weird way it seemed like I had been there before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: What is your connotation of Isabelle?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Like I said, all the movies I\u2019ve seen her in . . . I do watch a fair amount of foreign films and with France I\u2019ve noticed there are a couple of actors in a lot of these movies and she\u2019s one of them. The only connotation I have is that her movies tend to be, even if they\u2019re good or bad, they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">always weird. There is some underlying weirdness and usually it\u2019s some kind of psycho-sexual something.  She\u2019s attractive only because she does those kinds of roles. She\u2019s super pale, very odd looking \u2013 Tilda Swinton. More attractive than Tilda Swinton, but just this odd, very pale, basically the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">character in every movie. There is always something kind of aloof about her. I\u2019m assuming it was her. I never met or saw her in the dream, but I think that seemed to be who I was looking for. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: We have been talking about this \u2013 sexual experiences, [what you\u2019re going to think about them, what you\u2019re looking for in them.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. This is a weird segue, but because it also happened yesterday, the other thing I noticed yesterday \u2013 which was good, but my mom was complaining a little bit about my grandmother and I guess they had a rough night the night before and my grandmother was saying she didn\u2019t want to leave <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">our house. She was saying, \u201cThis is my house. This was my husband\u2019s house.\u201d She was telling them that they\u2019re trying to kill her \u2013 my mom and my aunt \u2013 just being kind of mean. My mom was like, \u201cBy the time we were able to get her to go home . . .\u201d I was going to respond, but then I just kind of stopped <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">myself and it was kind of cool. Then I forgot about it.  But the one thing that I think I need to get out of here, I think probably for that reason, is that this is going to end badly. How is this going to end?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">They are literally waiting \u2013 I don\u2019t know until what \u2013 until my grandmother either just dies or just starts acting really fucking crazier and crazier. There is no way for me to get involved with that because if I get involved I\u2019m the bad guy. She complains but then everything is fine the next day. Do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">you know what I mean? So there is no way for me to help in any way because to help means to call people out and be kind of tough. So it\u2019s like that part of me, that\u2019s the one thing. Remember I always say I love it here?  Other people leave their hometowns, but people like me love it here so they don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">want to leave. But in my case, that\u2019s the one thing that I do have in common with others. Other people do leave. They don\u2019t just leave Buffalo. There\u2019s usually something fucked up in their family that they just can\u2019t tolerate. This is becoming \u2013 I mean there\u2019s always stuff \u2013 but this just feels really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">. . . I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s different, but it just feels more surreal and so volatile and there is no way to do anything about it. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to be part of it anymore. I think it\u2019s very healthy. My mom is in my 70\u2019s and if I try to defend her and get upset for her, it backfires every <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200314\">single time. I don\u2019t know what to say.  Yeah, she has dementia and you guys aren\u2019t standing up and saying this woman needs 24-hour care in a good nursing home. Very simple. So I think I need to just cut that tie.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562576\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s happened before when you say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Remember there was that one time that I kind of blew up at my uncle and was like \u201cI have a mom, too.\u201d It\u2019s literally like getting into a fist fight or something, even when you\u2019re right, and then you feel kind of shitty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: But blowing up is very different than having a very measured conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: They won\u2019t have it. They won\u2019t have a conversation. My uncle has told my mom and my aunt, \u201cIf you want to put her in a nursing home, I will support you.\u201d But that\u2019s a pussy move. He doesn\u2019t want to do it, but he\u2019s like \u201cif you do it I\u2019ll understand and I\u2019ll support you.\u201d  First of all, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">being a douche because you\u2019re the one that has to pay for that. You\u2019re putting them in a weird position. And then they\u2019re douchy because they won\u2019t just be sisters and be like, \u201cWhat the fuck? You have two mansions, for Christ\u2019s sake. Take proper care of your mother. If you can\u2019t put her in a nursing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">home, then fucking set this up properly. Yeah, it\u2019s expensive, but you know what? You pay $20,000 for your lawn care. Deal with it.\u201d But they won\u2019t do that, so then if I get involved they just don\u2019t listen or they\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, obviously she\u2019s going to end up in a nursing home at some point.\u201d Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200393\">she\u2019s fucking 90. (sniggers)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And you think your mom won\u2019t \u2013 why? Why is she not saying \u201cyou\u2019re right, Brian?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Because my mom is a martyr and I think she thinks that if she pushes that too hard \u2013 especially my one aunt, who is also flighty \u2013 is going to turn on her and be like, \u201cYou just want to put mom in a nursing home.\u201d  Shit like that. And two, she\u2019s a martyr. She feels this obligation to see it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">all the way through to the end. It\u2019s my mother. And no logic helps that, even my fucking uncle. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, it\u2019s not a prison. Go be with her all fucking day. Be with your mother. Take her around. Drive her around. There is a safe place \u2013 not just safe, medically prepared, to take care of her.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">She won\u2019t bathe. She won\u2019t shower. Her hygiene is out the window. Come on, man. It\u2019s maddening. So because I can\u2019t afford to just pick up and move, then it\u2019s an added bonus of going to Assyria.  It\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m going, but it\u2019s an added bonus. This is going to end badly, I\u2019m pretty sure, unless <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D3\">my uncle somehow comes to his senses at some point. And my other aunt won\u2019t do it because she\u2019s homeless. She wants to do it, I\u2019m sure on some level, because she has to live with her. It\u2019s unbearable, but she has nowhere to go. It\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s like a train wreck. (pause) I can\u2019t get involved because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D4\">if I do I\u2019m going to really unload on my uncle. He\u2019s a douche; he\u2019s being a douche about this. I love him, but this particular thing he\u2019s being a douche. He\u2019s at the coffee shop almost every day with his old dumb-ass friends down the street from our house.  Especially now that my aunt is here, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D5\">he just doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. In some ways I get it, but that\u2019s not the point. You don\u2019t have to deal with them every day, but set it up in a way that then you really don\u2019t have to deal with them if you don\u2019t want to. This is not a good setup. It\u2019s a very odd way to take care of your mother. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D6\">I would never do that to my mom. If I had the money, no matter what my mom is my mom. The woman has made sacrifices. All the fucked-up things, she has been there. That\u2019s not the way you treat someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing anymore. I don\u2019t care if she recognizes us or not. That\u2019s not enough. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D7\"> But it doesn\u2019t get me worked up the way it used to. I kind of vent a little bit and then I\u2019m like \u2013 you know what? Eh. My mom is old, too. It\u2019s not like my mom is 30 and she\u2019s ruining her youth or whatever. If this is what she wants to do then fine, do it. But I\u2019ve been very good about not letting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D8\">her tell me too much. When she gets going I\u2019m like \u2013 \u201cUh \u2013 fuck that. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re telling me. This means nothing.\u201d She says, \u201cWell I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell don\u2019t tell me; tell your girlfriends because if you tell me I\u2019m going to get upset. I\u2019m going to make rational <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D9\">suggestions that you\u2019re never going to do. You\u2019re just making me upset, too.

That\u2019s what you do with your friends, but don\u2019t unload that stuff on your kid because it\u2019s too contradictory. (pause) Of all the three of them, my mom has really blown me away with how much I respect her. One of them is a nut job. I love her, but she\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">flighty and weird and she\u2019s not really taking care of my grandmother properly. She\u2019s living there \u2013 and she never has. She wasn\u2019t like that for her own kids. She\u2019s just not a very motherly cooking, cleaning, keeping the house nice. My mom really is. Everything is pristine. She always, at least, makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200412\">some soup. She\u2019s very health conscious. She\u2019s really good in that way and she\u2019s not as short with my grandmother.  Yes, she gets frustrated but, man. That\u2019s the only thing I need to get away because I feel like the full extent of that is not really being appreciated. My mom wants to do that or whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200413\">but it\u2019s hard to swallow because I just feel like I need to say . . .

That\u2019s if I fight and get into with my uncle, that\u2019s where I look like an idiot because then he gets shocked that I\u2019m so upset about it and then, yeah, he\u2019s going to say, \u201cI\u2019ve told her that if she decides that she can\u2019t handle it anymore, I totally support it. I\u2019m fine. I will do something.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200451\"> For me, this is where I have to stop myself. It\u2019s pride.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: Meaning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: It has nothing to do with my mom, on some level. Remember? I\u2019ve always had this pride thing. I feel like my pride is being trampled and I\u2019m unappreciated. I\u2019ve stopped myself from going there now because I get that a lot of that either doesn\u2019t have to do with my mom or it\u2019s manipulative. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200491\">doesn\u2019t realize it, but you can\u2019t get me all amped up and then the next day everything is fine and you\u2019re hanging out with my uncle. It\u2019s like one or the other, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve gotten very good at it. Whereas my Assyrian friends are like \u201cwho gives a shit?\u201d (chuckles)  That\u2019s the one thing I love <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200492\">about these Assyrians. It\u2019s been a good lesson in a little old-school, masculinity; and I think some of that is very healthy for these guys; like, \u201cDude, who the fuck gives a shit? They\u2019re all old. Your mom? Who cares?\u201d And they\u2019re right in some ways. Why am I getting all worked up about this? Let\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200493\">say my mom wasn\u2019t taking care of my grandmother. What \u2013 my mom is going to be traipsing the world? She\u2019s going to be sitting at home complaining about something else. It\u2019s something I feel, in general, about humanity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Or something you felt in your own history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: And about myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And kind of injustice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Feeling invisible or like others are doing whatever they want on their own time and having fun or whatever.  And of course, that\u2019s not true either, if I stop myself. Really, if my uncle is hanging out at Starbucks, what am I trying to say about that? What \u2013 like he\u2019s having a blast at Starbucks? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">That\u2019s pathetic. And also it\u2019s just probably one refuge of the day. (chuckles) He\u2019s got problems, too. I\u2019ve gotten much better. I\u2019ll vent to myself, but I\u2019ve noticed that now it feels good; it feels more like a normal sort of venting. I\u2019m able to just let it go and whatever. It\u2019s just sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re also catching it sooner and sooner and attaching it to the feelings we were talking about yesterday; like in school, thinking you are the one on the outside of everyone else \u2013 unseen, unappreciated, unwanted \u2013 and so I think you have a sensitivity to anything that has a whiff of that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">even with your mother.  Even if it\u2019s not her experience with it at all, it can feel like that for you and to sort of discover that that actually isn\u2019t even what was happening then, that\u2019s just how you constructed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Exactly. (pause) Also, I\u2019m able to stop myself and remember that my mom exaggerates, because that martyr thing, complaining thing, it\u2019s always exaggeration; so I\u2019ve gotten better at immediately taking only half of what she says. There is truth in what she says \u2013 always \u2013 but lots and lots of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">exaggeration and misconstruing for it to serve her purposes a little bit more.  So I\u2019m very careful about that now because in the past I would immediately go into a rage against my aunt and my uncle and a lot of times it\u2019s just not true, really, the way she\u2019s phrasing it. There is a kernel of truth, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200552\">but it\u2019s not so flagrant and whatever as the way that she\u2019s putting it. Regardless, it\u2019s all this silly family stuff that I\u2019m realizing even if you love your hometown, that\u2019s stuff you need to really separate from. In some ways, our family has very little of it. Some of the friends I have and the shit <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200553\">they deal with in their families is really amazing, the level of dysfunction or in-fighting or whatever. So this really isn\u2019t bad, but it still doesn\u2019t matter, you need a real break to cut ties to that kind of thing.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562576\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll still find it with you internally, but you\u2019re saying that\u2019s part of what you still work on even when you\u2019re away from it, but the actually separation of still being bombarded with it day in and day out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Of course you carry around your family with you. Of course, but just the day-to-day. Like I\u2019ve said in the past, you can be having a great week and then one or two little things happen with these idiots and that\u2019s it. All the work you did that week and how good you feel about things is just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">done. And also, this type of stuff affects if you are an anxious person, if you are a little bit of a hypochondriac or whatever \u2013 are you kidding? Every fucking day there is a complaint about something.  Even if it\u2019s on a physical complaint, just complaining and negativity constantly triggers feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200592\">of negativity in whatever part of your life. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So the next step is a plane ticket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: I was just thinking about that. It\u2019s also hitting me that it\u2019s the end of January. That\u2019s fucking crazy. I think there has to be a certain time frame \u2013 I think it\u2019s just ten days \u2013 but like Cecelia\u2019s shots and whatever things I need to do for her to travel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019ll need a letter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: And a letter, because I\u2019ve got to do that by phone. That stuff you can\u2019t do online. I\u2019ll find out what the things are about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Let me know when you need it by and if there is a particular way \u2013 like if they have language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: Like a template or something. I\u2019ll find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019ll draw something up and I could get it started.

March? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s still off-season, but yeah. Obviously, the closer you buy the ticket \u2013 so definitely early February at the latest I should make sure I have a ticket. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you\u2019re nervous to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">CLIENT: Totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: When you say early February, I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s stopping you from getting it tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: The cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have any cash?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a big part of it.

I\u2019m totally nervous. It feels unreal and weird and very quick and a part of me is wondering if I\u2019m rushing this. I could go in April or May. But again, I just don\u2019t\u2019 see \u2013 to stay and do what, exactly? When I could rent out my place and I\u2019m not living with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D1\">my mom; so then what am I doing? I have a place to stay there; things are going to be cheaper; I\u2019m going to cut down on expenses. So every time I go over it, it still sounds logical to go. (chuckles) But I feel nervous.

I try to remember that, yes, I\u2019m not selling the house.

All that is rationally obvious, yet there is something about it. Even Cecelia is a sort of symbol for whether you are going to lose everything that matters.

I didn\u2019t even know him in person. He could have been a douche, right? Or he could have been a really weird guy in person. I didn\u2019t know anybody. It kind of stayed that way. I made friends, but \u2013 you know. Assyria <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">is just not that. That\u2019s not the case. I already know a lot of people and also the lifestyle there is not the same \u2013 it\u2019s Assyria. They are going to be excited that I\u2019m there. It\u2019s just going to be very, very different.
