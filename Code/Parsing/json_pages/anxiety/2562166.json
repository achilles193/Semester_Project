(sighs) Performance reviews at work are today and I\u2019m terrified because I know my performance has been terrible. (sighs) I continue to have a hard time focusing at work. That sucks. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Do you expect to take a beating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s really nothing you can do and no way you can protect yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, in fact, it is like justly-earned punishment having been a fuck-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I see.  (long pause)  What\u2019s coming to your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: (sigh) It\u2019s crazy, but I\u2019m kind of bored with thinking about him. I would prefer him not to be the first thing that comes to mind all the time. (long pause)  He hasn\u2019t spoken to me since his birthday party and, even at his birthday party, he barely spoke to me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Ouch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yep. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m wondering a little bit if you want me to try to either cheer you up or be critical \u2013 not because you anticipate it would work if I tried to cheer you up or be critical, but more because then we\u2019d be kind of at odds, which would be no fun, but more pleasant than your dread of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">review and upset about Tracy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: True. (long pause) (sighs)  I was in Montana last weekend visiting Lo and I joked that for a month this year I was giving up thinking about people who make me feel sad. (sniffles) It\u2019s like the pink elephants; the more I try not to think about them, the more I end up thinking about them. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\"> I also discovered this morning that I completely fucked-up a thing with the press, that is actually time sensitive and now I\u2019m kicking myself over that. I ordered paper back in October for a chat book that I ended up not publishing because the whole situation with Penelope \u2013 which I don\u2019t really want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">to recount everything that happened \u2013 but one of the consequences was that the chat book didn\u2019t happen. So I never opened the giant, 20-pound box of paper. I popped it open this morning and realized that I had ordered cover instead of paper, so I have 900 sheets of cover stock and no paper to print <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">the insides of the book on.  I need to start printing this weekend for the book, the anthology that I\u2019m editing. Oops. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with 900 sheets of cream cover stock. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re probably going to tell me this is a stretch, but what that makes me think of is that you feel like, in a way, you have more available for, as I was talking about a minute ago, doing things to dodge or cover over the things that you\u2019re feeling really upset about.  But when it comes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">to actually feeling how upset you are or what is on the inside, you feel like you don\u2019t really have much of anything available to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (crying) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: And I guess I wonder whether there is some way this also feels time-sensitive, whether you feel like you are, in some ways or somehow, running out of time to deal with these things, like items with the performance review today or because you really feel like you should be done thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">Thomas or for some other reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562166\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:38). I just (pause) . . . There are a lot of things where I feel like I\u2019ve fucked-up or am in the process of fucking up.  I haven\u2019t kept in communication with the students I\u2019m allegedly advising at Boston University. That\u2019s actually a really poor fit for my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">skill set and I really do need to just e-mail the director and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t do this,\u201d and resign. That would be the most honest thing to do at this point, but I\u2019ve been putting off writing that e-mail for weeks. I feel really bad about that. (pause) (sigh) I was at my friend, Matilda\u2019s house <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">probably about three weeks ago. Matilda asked me to tell her the whole story of what happened with Thomas because she was really confused because she thought we were really good together; and so I told her everything, including the whole \u201cI poured my heart out and tell him I\u2019m in love with him and ask <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">how he feels about me and his response is \u2018Well, you\u2019re good in bed,\u2019\u201d which is . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Horrible<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Completely unacceptable. And I didn\u2019t realize this, but Matilda\u2019s roommate was in the other room and could hear it, could hear the whole conversation; and Matilda\u2019s roommate, Paige, also used to date Thomas. So Paige came out and was like, \u201cForgive me for eavesdropping. I couldn\u2019t help myself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">but having dated Thomas myself, all of this sounds really familiar and he\u2019s just really terrible at understanding that other people have emotional needs.\u201d Like \u2013 yeah. (pause) Even knowing all that, even knowing that he is a terrible partner and his responses to serious conversations were totally unacceptable, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">I\u2019m still worried that I made the wrong decision \u2013 that maybe I could have tried harder and done more, which is crazy.  Both parties in a relationship should be trying to make it work, but still . . . And he clearly wasn\u2019t trying or, if he was, his trying was completely ineffectual. Bah humbug. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">It makes no sense for me to continue to be hung up on him; none whatsoever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. In light of the other things we\u2019re talking about, there are various ways it\u2019s familiar and, I suspect, comfortable. He\u2019s impossible. This may seem a little silly about it, like you\u2019re stuck between an unstoppable force, which is your need \u2013 and understandably so \u2013 for the person <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">that you\u2019re with to care about how you\u2019re feeling; listen to what matters to you; respond with care and affection; be considerate of your feelings.  That\u2019s the unstoppable force. And the immovable object, which is Thomas, is none of those things and cannot be moved to do that. (both chuckle) I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">for you that\u2019s a very familiar position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Sure. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: At work, for example, the unstoppable force would be your need to get work done, to do well, to use your talents, to show people you did a good job and have them appreciate you \u2013 stuff like that \u2013 and the immovable object would be how you get stuck and shut down, how hard that is to penetrate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">or soften.  Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562166\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: There are other examples, but I think that\u2019s familiar about Thomas.  I guess my thought is it\u2019s a little bit like the dynamic I was mentioning before where actually, if I sort of don\u2019t try to push back about how you feel or make you feel better, or on the other side, like I\u2019m critical of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">how you\u2019re approaching things or something, in a way, stuff actually hurts more \u2013 not because in a way it actually makes things worse, but because then you\u2019re there with things that feel very painful.  I\u2019m not saying the alternative feels all that great, either. Clearly it does not, but I think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">one aspect I think of things, for example, with Thomas. There is a kind of frustration and stuck-ness and shame, which feels terrible. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a wonderful alternative, but I think it\u2019s familiar and, in some ways, maybe feels less anxious or safer.  I\u2019m also not saying I think this is the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F3\">only thing that [drew you] (ph?) to Thomas. I don\u2019t think that, but it does seem to me probably relevant. (long pause)  I would imagine that it may also be the quality here, but I think elsewhere at times \u2013 what was the name of the woman who was eavesdropping?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Paige.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Paige. I\u2019m sort of speculating here. You didn\u2019t really say, but my guess is that, on the one hand, it was a relief to hear what she said about how familiar that was. On the other hand, I expect it was a little disconcerting at first to know that she heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: A little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Not so much. (pause)  I guess my thought was that part of what was uncomfortable about having somebody right there with you, with what you went through or what you felt, felt a little close, a little like \u2013 whoa, not what I planned; but of course, also that she was supportive, very nice. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">(long pause)  What\u2019s on your mind? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: A serious paper sizing. The giant box of cover stock that I don\u2019t know what to do with is A series; it\u2019s A4.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Which is like 8\u00bd\u201d x 11\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s slightly off from that.  It\u2019s 8.25\u201d x 11.8\u201d. The [Perdition] (ph?) Club wanted to have letter-sized paper, but the nice thing about A series sizing is that, if you cut it in half, you get the next size down. The ratios are the same. So A4 is exactly double the size of A5, which is exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">double the size of A6, et cetera.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It has a logarithm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. But the print shop uses baronial sizes, which are not nearly as nice. A series is a metric 5; baronial is using British imperial units. They don\u2019t line up. So I have the thought that maybe I could recoup some of my losses and sell the paper to the print shop, but they\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">going to be able to use it because they work in [bar] (ph?) mostly. I mean, they could use it theoretically, but that\u2019s like I cut it down to A5; that\u2019s 1,800 sheets and that\u2019s kind of a lot.  (sighs) I feel like an idiot. (pause) I also got distracted trying to work out what my ratio of [side links] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">(ph?) would have to be for that doubling to work; 3:2 is the ratio. [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:53) maybe. I know there is the square root of two in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: If the area is doubled for each one, I think it is 4:2, isn\u2019t it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: 3:1 the other way?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562166\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yep. Easily distracted. Thinking about numbers is a much easier than thinking about feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Sure. I think distracted \u2013 another word for it is coping, for what it\u2019s worth.

I have a meeting at 11:00, at which I\u2019m supposed to present a presentation that I have not worked on at all because I thought it was next week. I didn\u2019t realize until yesterday that it was today, that all of yesterday I needed to focus on my presentation at 1:00, which I only barely have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">pulled together. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do at 11:00. (sniffles) By the time I get to work, I\u2019ll have about 35 minutes. I could throw together four or five PowerPoint slides. They\u2019ll be terrible but . . . (sighs) Yeah. It sucks, basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: I see.
