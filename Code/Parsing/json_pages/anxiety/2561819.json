I\u2019m carrying around all these extra layers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard to predict.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I know. I couldn\u2019t believe it was snowing this morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I know, after such a warm weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It was so nice on Saturday. We went for like a long walk to the library and I felt like it was just so nice to have a glimpse of spring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Although we knew it was just totally a tease because we heard Wednesday or Thursday there was supposed to be snow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve just got to enjoy it when you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I know. We definitely did. We took advantage of it, so that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I felt like last week was such a long week because Trae was sick again. This has been a bad stretch for us. I think that\u2019s a part of having kids that no one prepares you for is how often they get sick and then like how I just like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. Everything and you\u2019re feeling so badly for them but then figuring out work and school and what to do and everything. It\u2019s just so hard to balance it all and figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: You have less consistency than you thought you were going to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And you feel like with him, this winter especially, he\u2019s had like one every month. Yeah. This one, the doctor thought was just like a mild case of croup or a bad virus, but he\u2019s getting like all these things I\u2019ve never heard of. (Unclear). Now we know what croup is. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">all these things I never knew. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: A lot of them you only get once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yes, that\u2019s what everyone keeps telling us. So that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And he\u2019s like done with the infant mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yes. He\u2019ll never get that again. Same with roseola I heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Oh really? (Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: But I just like, he started to get sick not this past weekend but the weekend before and Brian was out of town so I felt like I tried to make it such a low key weekend and we were going to try to get together with friends but he had a temperature so I cancelled, I didn\u2019t make any plans. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">we were thinking of going home and I didn\u2019t do that just because I wanted him to like not get sick because I kind of knew something was coming and then he didn\u2019t go to day care on Monday and then the rest of the week he was out and had such a high temperature. And thankfully he\u2019s so good. Like he stays <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">in pretty good spirits when he\u2019s sick. But he was up a lot of the nights so I felt like Brian and I weren\u2019t getting a lot of sleep and it just was hard. I think it\u2019s a harder schedule this semester, too, because Brian\u2019s teaching three nights a week which is so demanding for him and also hard for us. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200333\">(Cross talk) Yeah. Because I\u2019m home with Trae and I love coming home and having that time with him but it\u2019s just hard to do on your \u2013 like that time of night is the hardest thing really. Just getting him fed and bath and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re just getting home from your day, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019ve had a whole day and you\u2019re totally on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: So I feel like just by Thursday and Brian was good \u2013 we could have traded off one day and my mom was still able to watch Brian on Tuesday but by Thursday when I was home with Trae, like I just look forward to Thursdays having that day but part of me was like, \u2018this is going to be such a long <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">day like inside the house again,\u2019 because he was still not feeling well and Brian wouldn\u2019t get home until late and I just felt myself being like feeling \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Restless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Restless, for sure. Yeah. And so in the end it was still cold out but it was really sunny and my friend had called to see if we wanted to go to the library and I was like, \u2018Trae\u2019s still sick and I don\u2019t want to risk you or your son getting sick,\u2019 but I texted her back and said, you know what? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">We could at least go for a walk with you to the library so at least like we got out. Like I just felt like I needed to get some fresh air and part of me was hesitant because it was cold still but I just like bundled him all up and I think that was good for both of us. I was kind of joking like I told <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">my friend, \u2018oh it will be good for Trae to get some fresh air and then when I actually met her I said, you know what? It\u2019s actually good for me.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: It was probably good for both of you. I mean the temperature of the air does not cause his illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I mean, he had a virus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Fresh air. Being exposed to fewer viruses, is probably good for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: So I feel like that\u2019s a part of it that\u2019s hard like when I am home with him like I love just getting out and doing stuff and not having to be cooped up and not seeing other people and so it was hard like just a hard stretch to be home and then have the days feel so long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (Unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) being off from school and be stuck at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I know. Yeah. Yeah. But then there are also times when I feel like we\u2019re so busy and have so much going on like sometimes it is nice to just have to be home on the other hand, but that stretch especially I think because Brian had been gone that week so I just hadn\u2019t seen anyone because Trae <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">was sick and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: You were feeling isolated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I didn\u2019t really, it wasn\u2019t like I was feeling anxious about that or anything, but just something that I know (unclear) especially on that Thursday when I sensed myself like getting in a bad mood in the morning with Brian like just knowing it was going to be a long time before I saw <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">him again. And so that strategy was good \u2013 just getting out of the house and being able to talk to your friend for a little bit and walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Being isolated is tough and a couple of days in a row feeling like you\u2019re not out in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a little bit too much for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so thankfully he\u2019s back to his old self now and we had a nice weekend of seeing friends. So I think now it feels so much better so it\u2019s funny to even think back to last week when I was feeling just like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Such a difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Just being able to get back into normal life again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Right. And I think just knowing he\u2019s better, too, because you just worry and we thought it was croup but we weren\u2019t quite sure because it wasn\u2019t like a consistent croup sounding cough so they weren\u2019t really sure what it was so now just knowing this \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Whatever it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: He\u2019s back. So now I think we\u2019re just looking forward to good weather when all these illnesses can pass, although who knows, (unclear) getting sick at any time of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Winter is probably worse. Partly just because you are inside so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And being outdoors in the fresh air helps to kind of cleanse, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: But when you have a group of toddlers inside and they\u2019re all touching the same things and I think inside play for them at day care is just more swapping of toys and spit and when they\u2019re more outdoors spending time on the playground they\u2019re less likely to eat the slide then they are all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">little toys (unclear). But I also think one of the reasons that you\u2019re finding this year has been especially hard for him is that you\u2019ve finished breast feeding so he\u2019s not getting a lot of the immunity \u2013 you gave him a lot that year, and he\u2019s much more mobile this year, so he\u2019s coming into contact <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200752\">with so much more than he did that was within his reach, but now he goes everywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I know, yeah. And with him, he didn\u2019t even get sick until he was around nine or ten months old. Like I remember thinking, oh we\u2019re so lucky. We have like this baby with such a good immune system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: You gave him such good immunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: And then it slowly flew away. We keep saying, at least a lot of these things he\u2019ll not get twice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know how much is scientifically backed, but I\u2019ve heard a lot of parents say, year one is actually worse than the first year in terms of illness and I think you\u2019re just exposed to so much more and a lot of people stop breast feeding after that first year or maybe some of this wears <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">off and most of the immunity you get right at the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Well yeah, that\u2019s been our experience too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: So then a study of like three \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: (Laughs) And you know he\u2019ll turn two on the 22nd which I can\u2019t believe so that will be like I don\u2019t know what to think \u2013 another milestone although I feel much better with this one for some reason. I felt like turning one was like really hard and just felt like that transition from baby into <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">toddler and now it feels like he is certainly a toddler now so it doesn\u2019t feel like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s going through a stage quite as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I think I felt so much of a mix of emotions last year. This year I feel so much more \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: It had a lot more built up around it in our culture really, puts a big emphasis on it and it\u2019s hard to know how to respond to something that has so much hype whether it\u2019s good or bad \u2013 it\u2019s big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So this is probably a little bit more -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: More relaxed. Although I\u2019m still trying to figure out his party and where \u2013 we finally decided where we\u2019re going to have it but now we\u2019ve been like trying to figure out \u2013 there\u2019s all these people we wanted to invite but on the other hand wanting to keep it small and kind of low key, so Brian <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">and I have been trying to figure that out because we have a lot of friends who we haven\u2019t seen in a while who have kids who live kind of far \u2013 not far, but not really in our neighborhood. So just trying to balance that. I\u2019m not so sure it makes sense to invite everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: What do you want?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I know. I think I do. The other thing is I think we\u2019re having it at the Amherst Public Library which I love the idea of and I didn\u2019t know you could do that, but they\u2019re like an open space \u2013 it\u2019s like a playground. And when I talked to one of the librarians she was like, you can certainly come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve been to like a zillion parties at that playground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Have you really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a popular spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: And then we can go inside which would be perfect like if it\u2019s cold out. But I just don\u2019t want it to be too big like I\u2019d think we were taking over the place either, if it\u2019s a library. So I think that\u2019s like \u2013 whereas I think Brian feels like just invite everyone and we\u2019ll see. Whoever can come, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">can come. But I think I have that hesitation of if other families are going to be at the library I don\u2019t want us to bring in like a whole ton of people, either. So we still have to figure that out. But other than that I feel like it \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Just pray for nice weather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: I know and then it all will be solved. Yeah. And we\u2019re not doing it until the very end of the month so hopefully, (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ll have a little bit more of a window.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it is, it\u2019s just so funny to think now we have like a two year old which I just can\u2019t believe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is just funny. It feels like it has this year totally flown by. It\u2019s just crazy how it just goes before your eyes like so now it\u2019s also like reminding ourselves to just be like enjoying the moment too. Like I feel it\u2019s another reminder of how quickly the year goes by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: What stands out most to you as a mom of most two year olds?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: That he can communicate so much with us. Like I just love that. Like even if I say, \u2018what do you want for lunch?\u2019 And he\u2019ll tell us and sometimes he\u2019ll say pancakes and that\u2019s totally random but like he\u2019s able to communicate so much with us now and I just think that\u2019s so cool. And like before <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">he goes to bed he likes to sing Rock-a-bye Baby but he\u2019ll replace baby with like all the things or all the people he\u2019s seen like he\u2019ll rock-a-bye like my mom or rock-a-bye Daddy. And then he\u2019ll say rock-a-bye dinosaur or like teapot or whatever\u2019s on his mind and it\u2019s just so neat that now we have that window.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been so much fun. And I feel like with me and Brian both and education too. Just to see how \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: To watch that development that we\u2019ve been talking about and seeing it in other people\u2019s kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Right. It\u2019s amazing to see it all. So that part has been really fun. And not as fun now that he knows how to say the word \u201cno\u201d and throws food everywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Another form of communicating. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yes. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to be appreciative of those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like now he\u2019s feeling better. It\u2019s just nice to \u2013 I feel definitely a sense of relief that last week is over. And I feel before he started getting sick and waking up so much in the middle of the night I had trouble falling asleep, like the night before he kind of got sick, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">so that \u2013 I feel like there\u2019s always like \u2013 my sleep \u2013 is always on my mind, too. And it was just kind of like that one night that I had trouble sleeping but then like him not sleeping so I was just up a lot and then I think I kind of got into the routine of being up a lot. So the other night I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB2\">trouble falling asleep just because I was waiting for him and so I think that\u2019s hard when (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Settled back. It\u2019s a trust that this is routine and get settled back into the regular routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t even \u2013 the first thing that I did have trouble falling asleep, I wasn\u2019t even quite sure what was bothering me but I just kind of felt \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you felt something was off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: And couldn\u2019t quite put your finger on it because it wasn\u2019t quite enough yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It could be totally random and coincidence. It may be nothing. Or maybe you sensed, kind of anticipated that something didn\u2019t seem quite right and that was enough to get you off kilter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I just felt like I was \u2013 once I am awake I let myself kind of wander and even our refrigerator kept kicking in and making this noise for like a few minutes and then it would turn off and then I got myself listening to that and thinking, oh, it\u2019s making noise \u2013 I better fall asleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">before it turns off. And then it would turn off. And I would think, \u2018oh finally it\u2019s quiet. I better fall asleep on this stretch.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Putting a little pressure on yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: It was so weird. Like we\u2019ve lived in this house for like six or seven years and why am I listening to the refrigerator, you know? That same noise has probably been present forever. So now it\u2019s like \u2013 even last night I caught myself thinking \u2013 it\u2019s off now, but when I go to bed is it going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">pop back on? And so I think \u2013 and I have been able to fall asleep since then so it hasn\u2019t \u2013 the refrigerator hasn\u2019t been too much of a problem. But, those kind of noises at night I think are things that used to bother me a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019d be scanning the environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And so I think \u2013 remember we had used a tool kind of deciding what you were going to think about, what you were going to focus on? So if you give yourself something to focus on, something like going to your imaginary place or going to your camp and the cabin, where you know it is peaceful <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">and imagining the quiet of being some place far away. Choosing what to focus on because when you don\u2019t do that you start to scan your environment for things that might be problematic and that\u2019s not \u2013 you can always find something and that\u2019s not conducive to being relaxed. So I think just at a time when <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D52\">it\u2019s a little bit trickier because you\u2019ve had some obstructions or you\u2019re feeling a little uneasy, is before you go to bed you\u2019ve made your plan for like I\u2019m going to take some deep breaths and I\u2019m going to think about drifting off to the place in my head and then you just focus on that to soothe yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D53\">to sleep rather that leaving it up to chance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I have gotten better than that. I think it was just an off night that I let myself like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You had an off night and then you had lots of real interruptions and now you need to just let go of that. You need to practice a little bit to get you back into your regular rhythm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I almost found myself like annoyed with myself that I even picked up on that, you know? It felt like something, those kind of sounds I remember during like a few summers ago, like our fan would drive me crazy because the fan speed would change all the time like with the wind coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB1\">in the window like that was something \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re really sensitive to environmental \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: That last summer that was fine. So it was just like, \u2018why did I pick up on that?\u2019 Like almost annoyed with myself that like here is a new thing that like will pass through my mind as I\u2019m getting ready for bed \u2013 listening to a silly refrigerator, you know, like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Well, you get to be in control of that. It doesn\u2019t have to be a \u201cwill I\u201d it\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m going to let that pass.\u2019 It\u2019s not something I need to pay attention to, like deciding what\u2019s most important in the environment and what you just let go. So you can notice it and choose to let it go. And trust <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">yourself that you have control of that \u2013 that it doesn\u2019t have control over you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. And I think it will get better. It just has been a hard stretch of being up and down, up and down from bed and everything. So hopefully I can take control of it and it won\u2019t be a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I have faith in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yes. And I feel like there were like other little think of now, I let myself wonder \u2013 am I feeling alright about this but then I kind of got confirmation that I did not need to worry about it. One of my friends asked me to write a recommendation for her and it was, you had to respond to specific <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">questions. And she had gone through this big surgery last year. She had brain surgery and part of it was, \u2018what qualities do you admire?\u2019 And so I had written in one of the sections how she had been through so much in the past year, just kind of vaguely and just kind of how she has this great perspective <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E72\">and all this and after I submitted it I got this bad feeling of like, what if that was something \u2013 her experience with the surgery was something that she wanted to be kept private. But she had a whole Facebook page about her surgery so I knew it wasn\u2019t private, but it was almost like I let myself worry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E73\">should I not have made reference to that when I submitted the recommendation for her and I almost sent her an e-mail the next day saying like I was going to send her what I had written but I was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m being silly.\u2019 I know this is something that she had talked openly about and she had to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E74\">ask a whole bunch of people for references so I\u2019m sure other people probably mentioned it even more explicitly than I did. So I held off on sending her an e-mail and then by the end of the day she sent me an e-mail like thanking me for the reference. And that just like felt good because I think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E75\">was something that I was worried about and it might have even been that same night that I had trouble falling asleep like just something on my mind that I knew like I didn\u2019t have to worry about but I kind of let myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: So I wonder what stops you from trusting yourself. Because you felt better once you got confirmation from her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: But what\u2019s keeping you questioning your own instincts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I think just because it was a medical thing maybe that wasn\u2019t \u2013 and they asked about how do you know her in school but also as a friend so it was kind of getting personal qualities too. But I think I just second guessed myself on like if she was thinking of that as something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">wasn\u2019t for public knowledge. I didn\u2019t know if I kind of overstepped her boundaries in sharing information. Even when I did write it I was kind of intentional about saying like all you had been through. I really didn\u2019t say anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">THERAPIST: You left it a little bit vague.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">CLIENT: But then even that like after I sent it I was like, \u2018oh, I wonder if I should have put anything in there at all.\u2019 So I think just because it was maybe like I guess some people would think of that as a personal thing that they wouldn\u2019t want to share but I kind of knew that she wasn\u2019t thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">of it as a private thing, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There\u2019s a lot of evidence that you used to back up your decision of what to write. She was open about it on Facebook. You did keep it somewhat vague so that she could spin it one way or another if she gets asked about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: So it certainly wasn\u2019t a thoughtless process for you. But there\u2019s something, you\u2019re not quite trusting and there\u2019s you know \u2013 I can hear why, where the doubts come from but I guess what I don\u2019t \u2013 what I\u2019m struggling to understand is what makes you not a good enough judge in your opinion to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">decide completely and be at ease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: But you made your decision. You put it in but you still second guess it. And that\u2019s certainly not \u2013 and that\u2019s the case with other things in the past, too. This is not a onetime thing. It\u2019s sort of a theme. You wait for someone else to give you confirmation that what you do is okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know why that is. And I wonder if that was the night that I was awake and so I wonder if I was feeling off anyway, so that was a moment of weakness that then I did let myself latch onto it and worry about it. But yeah, I\u2019m not sure why I can\u2019t just trust that I judged that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">was okay to (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: I made a good decision in this scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: It might be kind of a mantra to kind of practice. Because there\u2019s lots of evidence that you\u2019re a very competent adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: And you can trust that \u2013 your thought process is good enough to make a decision and allow yourself to be comfortable with the choices that you make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: I know and I do feel like that is like the theme of like, \u2018oh, did I do this?\u2019 That like I could have hurt someone else\u2019s feelings. Like did I do this and it has these unintentional consequences?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: What areas of your life do you feel most secure in? Where do you not need somebody else to say what you\u2019ve chosen is okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: I feel, I mean, just in our personal life, like with Brian I feel like I never do second guessing. I\u2019ll just \u2013 you know, we talk about it. I can\u2019t really think of an example. But that\u2019s something I don\u2019t ever feel like I question but then if I do say something or do something that might come <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">across in the wrong way we talk about it and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: So I don\u2019t have to sit with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think it like pops up most with school, like school-related stuff like I second guess. Either interactions with students or even like with my \u2013 thankfully, I haven\u2019t been writing many papers lately which is kind of nice because I\u2019m done with course work but like submitting papers <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">and worrying like if unintentionally like, plagiarized something or I feel like those are the things that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: When you were working at (unclear) was that similar for you?

[24:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: And you know I think maybe I did every once in a while but I don\u2019t know I feel like though like I don\u2019t know feeling that that sense didn\u2019t happen until I started my program. I feel like I just can like \u2013 that first time I started being in \u2013 (unclear) I feel like I can just locate a lot of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">to that, not that I didn\u2019t have feelings where I would second guess myself or feel anxious before that, but I feel like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: That is sort of questioning your confidence really feels like it came with that first semester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which is weird for me to kind of like be able to pinpoint \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011D\">THERAPIST: It was a really unique experience to feel like so out of depth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I like \u2013 there are certainly times before that when I would question different, you know, like different things, but I don\u2019t feel like I felt the intensity of it since before that first semester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: Somehow we need to find a way to sort of close the chapter on that semester because things are leaking out a little bit from that semester that semester that are lingering longer than they need to because in so many ways you\u2019re in such a different place and have been for many semesters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: But that second guessing yourself, not being able to completely trust your own judgments in these areas is lingering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m not sure why. Is it just me needing to tell myself that was a good decision?

This is the decision I made. Here are my reasons. I\u2019m going to trust it. To start practicing being your own validation. And seeing with that practice, can you let go of some of this lingering doubt and worry <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201291\">that gets in your way? If you weren\u2019t thoughtful about your decisions then I wouldn\u2019t be challenging you to do this. But you\u2019re not missing that piece. You\u2019re not making impulsive decisions that you\u2019re regretting later. You\u2019re making thoughtful decisions. Generally, somebody else comes along and confirms <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201292\">that it was an okay choice and you feel better. So we can skip over that period where you\u2019re anxious waiting for somebody to confirm it because the history shows us that you\u2019re doing a good job making thoughtful decisions. So you can affirm your own choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s maybe, something to become aware of in the coming weeks. If you find yourself in that place where you are second guessing it to give yourself permission to say, no, I made that choice and it was a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: And see if you can let it go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that will be good. Because it is, I think I just kind of let myself just kind of play that game like she didn\u2019t want to share that or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: And you can always create a bunch of what-ifs, but are they serving a good purpose?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Right. Like no, in know, I feel like I can let myself create a million of them and it\u2019s not useful at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20136-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20136-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561819\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: I mean that\u2019s often the test that I use in listening to the self-talk \u2013 is what I\u2019m doing adaptive or useful in any way?
