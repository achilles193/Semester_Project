[pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Oo, it's hot here. [pause] How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Good, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Sorry I couldn't come on Monday, I was in Ohio. I think I e-mailed you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yes, I got your e-mail, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it was on time. [laughs] What should we talk about? [pause] It's funny-or not funny, just weird to go to Ohio after a long time. I was thinking about Graham a lot. I keep thinking of writing him, but I know I won't, I shouldn't. It's just it's interesting to observe that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">from a distance, you know. Like he is quite an interesting guy, you know, like culture, and is always thinking in interesting ways. I was never like bored in his company. I was very anxious and \"on the edge,\" right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: On edge. [6:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: On edge. [laughs] I will never get-I always mix up my idioms. But I was always on edge and anxious. But never bored, you know. He always knew like the best places to go to for eating, and like, you know, the nightlife and all that. And I always thought I was learning something new, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">it was always-it's nice to have that stimulation, like it keeps your brain engaged. And you don't notice you'reBut you do notice, that's the funny thing. While you're engaged, and also on edge and anxious and like, you know, on the verge of screaming or crying. It's both. Like your heart is feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">something and your brain is feeling something else, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I'm not following. You're always on the verge of screaming or crying? Over what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: No, just with Graham, like last time-I felt very nice earlier, like there were moments when I felt very kind of engaged and com-not comforted and safe, but, you know, like comfortable in my own skin because he seemed to be approving, or you know like complimenting. Well, obviously that was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">when he was, you know, interested in having sex. [laughs] Or maybe not that, but you know. But then last time, since the last time things were-and last time things were really weird between us, and he was very critical of my clothes and everything, and so-my behavior I guess, I don't know. So the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">he was saying personally to me were hurtful, but-you know, the things we were doing might have been interesting to my head, but my heart was feeling something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. [9:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I spent most of my time in Ohio with Nelson this time, so I was just comparing and thinking about that. Like I was bored, but not anxious or on edge, or like not on the verge of crying or screaming or anything. Yeah, it's funny, I took both Graham and Nelson to like the same place, it's the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">restaurant that I like near my school. And Graham came in, and they sat us, and then he was all of a sudden like, \"Okay, this is not right, let's go somewhere else.\" So then he picked a place much more expensive and stuff. But I felt completely uncomfortable, you know. So. But then, you know, Nelson <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">didn't do that, he was the opposite. He sat down and he was cold, and he was uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Cold? [10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Cold as-oh, sorry, the weather was-I don't know, it has-this place has a patio and like it was a little chilly. But yeah, he was cold also because-a little cold personally, just because he was uncomfortable. Not knowing what to order or how to pronounce certain things. He was like, you know-I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">was trying not to judge him, you know, not like, \"Oh, you're not cultured enough.\" [laughs] You know, but. And I was thinking that, you know. But now I'm wondering, I should just completely change my thinking, and I'm tired of thinking this way of like comparing people, and specifically guys, and thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">what they bring to me and what I get from them. I think I'm tired of thinking that way and I want to make-yeah, I don't know what the alternative, but something like, you know, what I want and who I am. Maybe not as self-centric as that. But I don't think trying to know who I am is that self-centric. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">I mean, it's self-centered in a way, but it can be positive. Because I'm totally like-some days I'm really, really like lost I feel. [11:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560588\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">And like I want a place of my own, no roommates, where I can have all my books. And cook, you know, and establish myself. Because I have all these disparate things, if I just put them in one place I feel like I'll know who I am, you know. I could get Chris's-my books are at Chris's. And my art is at <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">Chris's. My kindness is-well, kindness, it's too lofty a word. But you know, like little things, childhood things, are with my mommy. And, you know, my wildness is at Nelson's. [laughs] So that's like I really-I'm like spread out in different people's homes. But that has to wait until I can make some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">money, so. [13:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">But getting too-like too much to like think about, \"Oh, he did this. Oh, he said that. And then that guy said that. And what does that mean?\" You know, like I'm tired of that. Nelson and I were talking this weekend, and I don't know, I guess-like he has a little-he subterfuges a little bit-or maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">it's just my paranoia. But like we were talking about I don't know what. But he's already talking about marriage, but I was just talking about like us I guess. And he said something like, I don't know, \"I want someone who's much more confident.\" And, \"I'm a social person and I need, you know, my companion <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">to be able to interact socially,\" and all that. I'm like... And I just felt like coiled-like a little coiled up inside me, with like felt really insecure when he said that, because, you know, I do lack confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Nelson was making a comment about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. ButWhat did I say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I didn't know if he was sort of speaking generally or was speaking to you in particular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Well, I guess both. But like, yeah. And that must have had some reference to me I guess. But... I don't know. Yeah, and he was saying that. And then I was just like thinking of Chris, and I was like-I was feeling really sad. I was thinking, you know, Chris and I had blind love, Jeremy and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">had blind love, and like, you know, we just wanted to be together and get married and like, you know, in a speech you know. And they didn't find faults, they just fell in love and then they were like, \"Okay, this is it, cling and hold on.\" But then, you know, as time went by and problems arose we-I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">guess we didn't do anything with them, and like went and didn't really deal with them properly. [15:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">So Nelson was like, \"No, well, you know.\" And I was like, you know, \"You just-I don't want-I want blind love,\" and that we should just break up because, you know, we want different things. And then he was like-I don't know. Well, you know, like-and he was like, \"You're too practical,\" and these other<\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">He was like, \"You can't have both, you know. Like I hope I have been understanding, and you can't have someone understanding and have blind love,\" or something. \"Because I went out with you despite the fact that even after you told me that you were staying with your ex-boyfriend and you were the first <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">with him.\" [chuckles] So.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560588\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I don't understand, did he break up with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Did he break up with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: No. No, I was trying to break up with him. [laughs] But it didn't happen, so. Then he teared up. I don't know. But he was just saying, you know, likeAnd then all of a sudden he was like, \"What are we talking about? I thought we were talking about marriage.\" And I was like, \"No.\" And then he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">was like, \"Then we're good, we're just talking about us.\" And I was just like, what just happened? This conversation gets really confusing I think. Because I'm not paying attention, and I'm like bored by it or something, and like-yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: What was boring about it? [17:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: [laughs] Because, I don't know, I wasn't very interested [unclear, laughing]. And this is what I mean, like I don't want to like think aboutBut I don't [need? 17:57] Nelson to think about conversations, I want to do things [with?] thinking. But when we change it in a way that it's like a small <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">thing in the larger-in a large house where there are other things, and like, you know, there is other bigger more important things. You know what I'm saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: No, I actually don't know what you're talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: So like we-constantly thinking about what Nelson said and what it means, and what I said to him and then what that means. And that like constantly-like and making that to be something really huge and significant. I want it to be less significant, and I want to put it in such a perspective that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">it feels less significant than it's-and I'm less like buffeted by it, like the back and forth. And like I want a different emotional center, like a core that is built of more stable stuff I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm, okay. More secure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don't want that just to be like a [unclear 19:17] instead of like [unclear], you know. You know, which I can't eat, or, you know. Like I want my oxygen to be something else. [pause] Because otherwise I feel completely like that and subterfuged, you know, about Nelson. But like, you know, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">not in control and confused all the time and-even by little things. You know. [long pause, almost two minutes]. Do you think having a place of my own will help me in building my core, or... [22:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Sure. The question is what form will it come in. Is a place of your own emotional, is it physical? Will physical help in emotional? The problem is now that you rent a place of your own but you can't live there. So that didn't solve that problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: No. [pause] [unclear 22:35] just live with myself. [laughs] Yeah, we haven't tried stuff. I actually go there and like stay put, but... [pause] I'm trying, I'm trying to make-I'm working on it, it's just not happening right now. I think it might, you know, like because Chris's will be off, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">he'll be at home working, so then I'll probably feel like I need to be all by myself in the room, and then maybe I'll call it my place. [laughs] [pause] And I don't know, completely my own place might help me, like having all my things there maybe. It's just that my unique situation makes me very nervous, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">and then I use the excuse of my mom to be like, \"Oh yeah, I can't afford it.\" I definitely use it as an excuse. [pause] Maybe if I think about it I will eventually do it. Because I didn't even think in these terms earlier. [pause] [26:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560588\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">And then there is like-I feel like once I build up enough reasoning power then I might maybe have more strength to do it. And like I keep telling myself, \"Everyone's lonely,\" you know, like, \"Everyone deals with the same stuff I'm dealing with. No one is immune.\" And especially like this time of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">year when people are going away for holidays, and they're all stuck at airports at first, but they were eventually getting to their destination and families and lots of family members and stuff. I'm just feeling very left out. But, you know, there are so many people who are left out. My mom gets lonely <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">too, you know. I was helping her with her work yesterday and like she couldn't last like half an hour without watching her TV. [chuckles] It was like-and that's how she deals with her loneliness, you know, she likes the constant noise and stuff. Chris drowns himself in work. [chuckles] Everyone drowns <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200553\">themselves in work, or TV.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Really, because everybody's lonely?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Because you feel everybody is lonely? [27:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Well, I'm just like telling myself that's why I'm like-so I can, I don't know, try and live by myself and deal with that loneliness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: So you anticipate feeling lonely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think if I anticipate I will probably prepare myself, you know. I'm trying to be more realistic, you know, and not-because I feel like I have this tendency completely to be unrealistic. So I think that's progress. I don't know. [chuckles] But are you seeing it as something negative, or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: I'm trying to understand how you're feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. But like you said, anticipating being lonely, like as opposed to something else, or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: No, I'm just wondering-yeah, I'm wondering where the loneliness is coming from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Oh. You mean like as opposed to like anticipating-I don't even know what I was like with anticipating. [laughs] Well, like what would you anticipate if you had an evening by yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Not loneliness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I anticipate tons of things, positive or negative I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah? Well, there's some activity. [pause] Well, like I could read stuff, read books, then I'd just be reading. [chuckles] Reading, you know. [pause] What else is there, I can't think of anything. Either occupying my mind, or leaving it empty so I feel sad. Two options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Can you give me a third?

So much to be explored, so much to feel angry about, sad about. [chuckles] Avoid, not avoid. [chuckles] I imagine like, really, really, really, really old people feel at peace. [chuckles] <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">And like sitting quietly in an armchair or something. [chuckles] I'm really in fear of that. I don't like that picture. [chuckles] [long pause, one minute] And as an only child I always like-I did have to entertain myself. It's not that I never ever liked being all by myself, I did. I do understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A52\">that state of mind where you're spending time just by yourself for days. Well, maybe not days, but maybe like hours. So I know that state of mind, and I know that there is joy and comfort and peace there, it's just... Recently I guess I've just been in a very unstable, really insecure place. [32:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like one of the ways you anticipate feeling lonely is that you'll be left alone with your feelings without any distractions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Hm. Yeah. Distractions. Well, there are distractions. There's the computer, that's all you need. [chuckles] Movies, TV, work, music, books. There are distractions. [long pause] I guess there's also like the meaning of things that I'm scared of I guess. If I could just tell-I mean, and I'm telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">myself it doesn't mean anything right now. Right now is not when everything is going to be decided, and you know, this isn't like the ultimate thing. You know. [pause] Like one time, one evening I was sitting at my place in my room waiting to go somewhere, and it just felt like a sentence, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A92\">like a jail sentence, because... I was like, \"I've done this to myself. I walked out of Chris's place. It was beautiful, I made it beautiful. And it was the two of us, and we shared this and that. And like he was comforting me, and he offered me safety, and we had love, but I broke it, and here I am <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A93\">punishing myself.\" [chuckles] [35:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: And what happens that you create that narrative? That's the whole narrative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: It's not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Do you think it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: At that time it seemed pretty convincing and complete. It's not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Do you think that Chris is the right man for you, you're sure of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Then what are you doing with Nelson then if you're so sure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Well, you can't be sure then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I have no idea. It's like your right hand was doing something and your left hand was like, \"What?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: No, I think I've put myself in this dark box in which I forcibly don't see anything, even though I see it. Yeah, what happens? [chuckles] Where does it come from? Just I guess I guess really being scared. I don't know what I was. [pause] Just that intense-that moment becomes very intense, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">it's everything, and there's nothing else. Like the professionally painted walls at Chris's place, versus the walls I paint. It was painted like there was great joy in painting them myself, and getting the paint, using it, and matching it with my curtains. [chuckles] [pause] I guess-I mean, guilt, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">feel intense guilt for leaving him knowing that he still loved me and I still, you know, love him. [pause] But there are other moments that were not so bad in that place, when I was actually working or... So. [pause] Should I like focus on the moment where I decided to move out? To give myself strength, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C13\">to like complicate that narrative. [long pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560588\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess one question is, why do you want to simplify it? [40:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: [I didn't feel a want\/I don't know if I wanted?] to simplify it. It feels like voluntary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Hm, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Maybe I do. To make myself suffer? [chuckles] I like suffering? [chuckles] People do say I'm really hard on myself, and like I have really, really high standards for myself, and I never achieve them. [pause] But I'm trying to be so relaxed. I'm like, I'm so ridiculously relaxed now that I-you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">know, I do indiscretions, and then-that normal people who are quite relaxed with themselves won't do, you know. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Well, how do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: Well, like seeing Chris and Nelson. [41:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you go back and forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Between being very harsh and giving yourself permission for things that you don't actually want to give yourself permission to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Or kind of turning a blind eye, but then feeling guilty, and then-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] Again, me being needy, really needy. The balance is not there I guess between two extremes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. [pause] What did you feel at the end of the weekend with Nelson?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I'm wondering. The way you presented it it sounded very vague and hazy. I really didn't get a sense at all of what was going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Well, I was having my period so we didn't have that much sex. But it's like, you know, the sex with him is mostly like-I don't know, we haven't really discussed it that well, but it's mostly like he-his climax is important. And it's not even like sex sex, or intercourse, you know, it's like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">whatever. But I'm really attracted to him so I find it very nice and I like it, whatever we do. But still at that moment it is like, oh. And then I build that narrative, like, \"Oh, it's all about you, isn't it?\" [chuckles] You know. I don't know, I felt weird, you know, like saying-because he has an <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E12\">apartment in Ohio, I've never actually spent a night in it. Always like gone to Aurora andI was thinking about Graham, you know. Like I was thinking how he was more interesting, but made me feel weird. But Nelson is nice, andI guess I felt nice. I don't know if I allowed myself completely to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E13\">nice, but I felt okay, I felt-I don't know if I felt at peace, but maybe I felt at peace, and thankful to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: You know what, that's what it is, I don't like being at peace. [laughs] I want to be uncomfortable, and agitated, and anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Well, that's a lot for us to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: If that's at leastIt's clearly not the whole truth, because peace is appealing too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Well, otherwise you wouldn't even-if you wanted to be anxious and agitated why even bring it up, you just do it, you don't need to talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560588\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: You know what, I hate to end on that note because it's really important, I think we should continue to talk about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Okay.
