That I was going to then tell you Thursday, but then, I had to be out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">But maybe I\u2019ll mention it now. I mean, first of all, sorry, again, for having to cancel for Thursday. Everything is fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">I mean, it (inaudible at 00:00:47) to me like this. So, it seems that we wound up on Wednesday that, at times, we do, where I don\u2019t know how well you remember what we were talking about, but I . . . (inaudible at 00:01:04) you can say it was something that has come up fairly often.  Which is about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">way that you feel stuck. Having to be focused on things, pushing hard a lot of the time, always getting a lot done, active, busy. And how maybe other people have their who or they are who do things differently and who, at times, encourage you to do things differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And that\u2019s where you get stuck, because even though it conceptually, it seems like something more in the middle or something allowing more flexibility would be better, in practice, it actually doesn\u2019t work like that for you. What happens is if you say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not going to the gym today,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">going to slow down at work and only do 80 percent of what think I should get done,\u201d you feel crummy.  Or you get anxious or frustrated with yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And so even if it, in a way, it seems like a sensible idea, it just doesn\u2019t work. And so it leaves you . . . uncertain about what to do. And then, the way that it seems to me you\u2019re saying that comes up here is I seem to have some ideas, however precise or vague, about some alternative way this could <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">get better. [chuckles] Although you\u2019re not real clear what that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">And so, in a way, that doesn\u2019t really help matters much, either.  And you don\u2019t necessarily, I think, see me as somebody who\u2019s telling you, \u201cWell, just slow down,\u201d \u201cTake it easy,\u201d or, \u201cThat\u2019s really what you need to do.\u201d So I\u2019m now failing to be helpful in that way, that people often do when they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">trying to be helpful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">I\u2019m still not being all that helpful in that you still feel quite stuck in the same dilemma and unsure what to do about. Which, mostly, I think, as we\u2019ve talked about, feels to you like a failure on your part, because you\u2019re struggling with this. You don\u2019t know what to do. People tell you things, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">it doesn\u2019t really help. So it\u2019s on you. And yet, in a way, it\u2019s on other people or on me, because nobody\u2019s really doing that much to make it any easier for you or move things along for you at the same time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So, I have a thought about all that, but first, I want to make sure that I\u2019m more or less getting the situation right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yes, you said?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay. That seems like a pretty central thing to you, too? This [kind of thing] (ph) that I\u2019m talking about, yeah? All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve had a little bit\u2014right.  So, then, I guess I\u2019m pretty aware that what I\u2019ve just described . . . is really what it\u2019s like. I have an alternative point of view on it, which goes like this: So, for example, apply to things here. Your experience is, in a way, of being faced with a practical <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">problem. Namely, what do you do about this? Both, in a way, while you\u2019re here and more broadly. (inaudible at 00:05:57) come if it feels like . . . we\u2019re not getting you through this impasse? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562036\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">I mean, I imagine there are others ways that you could find this helpful or supportive or whatever and I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m just putting that off to the side for now. And as you\u2019ve not said anything like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s get through this right now or bust.\u201d (inaudible at 00:06:29) [chuckles] But I think it\u2019s important. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">And I think this impasse figures large in your thinking about this and how you\u2019re doing, in general. Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, that\u2019s a practical problem. And it\u2019s an important one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I think, in a surprising turn of events, I think that that practical problem, which is a real one and one that deserves serious consideration. Also conceals an emotional issue or you could say problem.  Which is that what the impasse feels like, what the stuckness and passivity and uncertainty all feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">like . . . particularly . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: . . . when you\u2019re here with me and . . . you know that I see it and you also, I think, feel some sense that we\u2019re helpless in it together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">So, like I said, from one angle, there\u2019s a practical side of this. And from another angle, there\u2019s an emotional side of it, which involves what it feels like, what the experience is like of being stuck, helpless, not knowing if it\u2019s on you or on me or how much it\u2019s on you or me. Or if it\u2019s somehow on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">us together, in the way that we\u2019re trying together to deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">And I think it\u2019s very easy for that emotional angle to get obscured by the practical considerations. But one reason I think the emotional piece isn\u2019t\u2014there are a few reasons I think the emotional piece is an important one. One is I think the way you feel it in here and in terms of how we\u2019re trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">work on this is pretty\u2014I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s pretty similar to what it feels like when you\u2019re lab, struggling with the parallel problem. Or at home on a weekend. Or trying to think through something social that happened. That there\u2019s the practical question of what\u2019s your judgment going to be about what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">happened between you and somebody else. Or what are you going to do on a Saturday morning when you have some flexibility in your schedule or some time and you\u2019re not sure what you want to do? Or the analog (ph) at work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I mean, the practical question, again, it\u2019s important and it\u2019s one you\u2019ve got to figure out. [chuckles]  But there\u2019s also what each of those situations feels like. And I think that\u2019s pretty much all the same. I think the feeling in each of those situations, including the one in here, is pretty similar. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I think in here . . . pretty clearly, in a way that is a little different from in your life outside of here, we dwell on it. [chuckles] I don\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t stick with you, but we talk about it and we fuss over it. That sort of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">But my point is . . . I think the actual problem you\u2019re having has to do more with the emotional side of this.  And the pitch of anxiety, vulnerability, confusion you feel . . . in this stuck situation that I\u2019m referring to, that passivity and helplessness via (ph) confusion. And I think you really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">. . . I think you have a very intense emotional reaction to it that\u2019s hard to be clear about or aware of or think your way through when you\u2019re in the middle of it, because it\u2019s so overwhelming. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562036\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: And I think it\u2014you . . . I think that\u2019s really where you have trouble, is with the emotional side of all this. And I think you get a little focused on the practical side. Which is very real and very important, but I think you do it a little bit . . . in an effort to help settle yourself down, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">because just staying with the emotional side is so God damn overwhelming. I mean, I really think it\u2019s horrible. I mean, what I mean is (ph) it feels really bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">I think however often you\u2019re coming here, I think a significant amount of the work will involve our looking at that, you\u2019re getting a little more used to tolerating that, understanding it, metabolizing it, in a way? Does that make sense, what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think my laying it out this way is any kind of solution or procedural manual . . . for how to deal with these situations.  I\u2019m saying I\u2019m trying to reframe a little bit where I think you get stuck and why. And how I think you\u2014and I think the kind of things that we can work on to help <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">make it better. Which involve . . . gradually coming to tolerate and . . . deal with the anxiety of and get more clarity about or understanding of what\u2019s going on when this happens.  Why it\u2019s so overwhelming. Getting used to that in a way that helps you feel more settled when it\u2019s going on, so that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">you can think, in a sense, where you\u2019re actually at in any individual situation where you\u2019re stuck and this comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess I thought it might be helpful for me to . . . at least, in a sort of conceptual way, provide a kind of overview, a (inaudible at 00:15:51) of what I think you\u2019re having trouble with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">And this is often the way that psychoanalysts (inaudible at 00:15:56) analysis work is that you wind up stuck in the same place in the treatment with the analyst that you are everywhere else.  And you don\u2019t find an answer or a solution or a strategy so much as you come to get used to gradually think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">your way through, become less anxious and churning and paralyzed by the feelings that come up in the situation or around it, so that you can think and operate and get a sense of how you feel and where you\u2019re coming from when the problem comes up, in a way that you couldn\u2019t before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: So, I guess, first, is that . . . am I being clear? Do you have questions about what I\u2019ve laid out? Are there parts of it that either don\u2019t make sense or don\u2019t seem right or? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: It seems right. I guess . . . I don\u2019t know. I guess it makes me a little anxious to, I guess, because I\u2019m immediately drawn (ph) to\u2014I don\u2019t know. Problems that\u2014I don\u2019t know. Being stuck in a situation\u2014I don\u2019t know.

Something more like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: [Uh uh] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

I don\u2019t allow myself to be in these situations. That\u2019s what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">think of.

I\u2019m not exactly posing this as a question for you to answer, but it seems like it\u2019s a central question. Why it is that . . . the thing that works is having somebody step in and tell you how to look at something or tell you what to do? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I mean, there\u2019s a way in which that . . . limits somewhat how you might choose to approach something or what you might feel is right.
