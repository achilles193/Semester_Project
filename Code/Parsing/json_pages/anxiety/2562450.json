But I can \u2013 the person I usually see is overseas for a little bit. And the time difference works better that way, but I can ask. It\u2019s much better for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Well, right now I have something schedule \u2013 like this, and also Hebrew is moving to Mondays. And that is during a lunch hour, but I can probably meet with them at 11:00 instead of at 12:00 and then get here at 12:00 your time. One of the two will have to move, but I think that I can move them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">if I can\u2019t move this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re still seeing David on Monday mornings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I can probably push it to 10:00 but that probably doesn\u2019t help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Well, I see David at 8:15, so I can probably meet at 10:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Do you want to meet at 10:00?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: No, I really don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s nix that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019ll probably see if the Hebrew people can meet at 11:00. I think they can do that. [1:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: If it doesn\u2019t work with them let me know so I can see what I can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. I feel like what we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of sessions has really shaken me up a lot, or at least I\u2019ve felt very shaken up. I don\u2019t really know what to do about that. [2:25] It feels like \u2013 I feel like I have these kind of endless conversations with you in my head, and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">I show up and I like, can\u2019t talk. This is hard. (pause) And I find that like \u2013 I find in my conversations with James and Franco, I talk about therapy and you in sort of a defensive way, or it feels like in a defensive way. (pause) [3:55] I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m feeling so bad like, because of what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">we\u2019re talking about in here or whether I\u2019m just feeling really bad, but I feel really bad anyway. And it sort of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I think it has some relation to what\u2019s going on in here, but it\u2019s not clear quite what. [4:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: So I Googled you. And just like, an analysis, sort of read about it. Just sort of, three minutes in, I\u2019m really anxious about this, aren\u2019t I? I just kept reading. So there\u2019s that. It\u2019s nice having the name Tanya. It\u2019s totally useless to Google myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Benjamin Appelbaum\u2019s a bit tougher that way. [5:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: That seems to be an area where like, etiquette hasn\u2019t really caught up yet. I just assumed that, talking with friends who do a lot of online dating. Well, is it okay to Google the person. I assume that yes, it\u2019s expected, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the assumption. I think a lot of people just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">do it and then feel bad about it. But I don\u2019t know. [6:35] Anyway, if I didn\u2019t know, I could tell where your office was. And, I actually found the title of your thesis, and that\u2019s about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I think you can actually find the thesis online, and if you\u2019re ever having insomnia \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Then, you know. It will be very helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: No, I think my main curiosity would be to see how you write. [7:30] (pause) I always think about other people\u2019s writing. It\u2019s a very like \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I always think that editing another person\u2019s writing is a very strange thing for me. It feels like a very intimate thing for me. I don\u2019t think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">other people think of it like that. [8:22] (pause) Obby was a terrible writer.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562450\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well, no. He wasn\u2019t a terrible writer, but he wasn\u2019t as good as he thought he was. These sort of sloppy tendencies that academia encourages. He had a lot of \u2013 he would get very convoluted in his sentence structure in ways that were totally unnecessary and sort of everything that he would say <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">he would kind of hedge it around with things like rather, or sort of, or not exclusively or things just sort of weaken the statement such that it was maybe more precise, but it was much harder to get at what he was actually saying. [9:26] James also is not as good of a writer as he thinks he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Actually, that I think is more of a \u2013 his style is quite a bit different from mine, and also the things that he writes are generally not things that interest me very much. I guess actually, I haven\u2019t really read anything of his that I have the background to understand since we were in college. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I don\u2019t really have much of a basis for saying that. Like, chemistry writing is, you know, it\u2019s \u2013 The analogy I think of it is like making a frittata where if the vegetables are the formulas and the data, there\u2019s just a little bit of egg in there. [10:57] Just enough words to kind of make it all stand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: (pause) [11:46] I\u2019m going to work for a couple of hours. (inaudible at 11:55) has a conference call. I\u2019ll go round the kids up and feed them dinner and so forth. That will be good. (pause) It seems very strange. So I\u2019ve been writing back and forth with Heather Kate about her move and offering <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">to help. [12:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s moving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. She\u2019s moving here to teach at \u2013 her husband is teaching nearby. So it seems like it\u2019s \u2013 she\u2019s having this baby in early June, moving in July or August. She\u2019s not going to have a teaching position for the next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: This is her second?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. They have to put the house on the market in two weeks. I think they bought the house when she was about to pop with the first one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: They like to do everything once. Or, they\u2019re stuck doing everything at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: She really doesn\u2019t like doing everything at once. But at the same time, it always seems to happen. [13:22] But it\u2019s interesting. She was always my first good friend. We were friends when we were 14 and 15. And now she\u2019s trying to sell a house and trying to figure out childcare for her toddler. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">And so I\u2019m offering to take care of Violet, because that\u2019s what I do for a job. And like, while she and Diego move. It\u2019s like, in some ways, the things that we talk about are quite different, but the way that we talk and the sort of manner is still quite similar. It feels very strange. It\u2019s fun and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">nice, but also very strange. [14:13] I guess I never really \u2013 I never expected to have relationships that lasted long enough for that to be the case. (pause) I don\u2019t suppose you anybody out there, any therapists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I can look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Can you? Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: For Heather Kate? Any particular criteria other than somewhere near there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so. At least, if there are any, I don\u2019t know any. [15:45] She put on Facebook a while back a picture that she had taken of \u2013 it was like, a paper plate that was painted and it had \u201cboys suck\u201d painted on it. And apparently, I gave it to her. I don\u2019t remember that at all. But it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">like yeah, that\u2019s about right. We were sort of partners in drama. [16:42] Her husband is the eldest son of the woman who was the head of our high school. He also was roommates with my sister\u2019s ex-boyfriend in college. And she dated his younger brother first.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562450\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Your sister.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: No, Heather Kate. The brother first. There\u2019s been some drama. (pause) [17:47] I don\u2019t know if that relationship\u2019s going to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Between she and Diego, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: No, between she and me, actually. Since we were in I feel like when we went to college and basically sort of grew apart pretty rapidly. Mind you, it was within six months of starting college she was in the hospital for anorexia. She was totally broke down. And anyway, we just haven\u2019t gotten <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">back in a significant way since. She was in my wedding. I was in her wedding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: In the meantime it\u2019s been kind of long distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It feels to me like, we used to be really, really important to each other. And given the chance, we might be really important to each other again. We might have changed and now that might not work. I don\u2019t know. [19:26] I feel she\u2019s someone with whom I can pick up where we left <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">off, maybe. (pause) I like being here so much, and I don\u2019t know how to say that. I feel so bad saying it. So, that\u2019s the thing. [20:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Thank you for saying so. I imagine it\u2019s very hard to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why. I keep sort of touching back on like, last week or the week before where you referred to my saying something positive, and I had no idea what you were talking about. It doesn\u2019t feel positive. It doesn\u2019t feel good. [21:20] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m not \u2013 I understand that. I\u2019m not clear in what way it feels bad. I get that it does, I just am not sure how.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: (pause) [22:15] I worry that \u2013 I worry a little bit about your sort of misunderstanding the nature of my needing to be here and feeling strongly about you. Mostly, I just feel like if I say anything about it, I feel like it\u2019ll be gone, or I will leave or I will go away. It feels like it\u2019s going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">to go away anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really going to screw it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: The sort of death code that I have for sort of hanging onto this for another week and not saying anything about it. [23:22] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Are you clear what it is that I\u2019m going to misunderstand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Not really. You know, like, the obvious is that you\u2019ll think it\u2019s like a sexual thing or that I have a crush on your or I\u2019m in love with you, none of which are the case. But I also sort of know better. I know that you can\u2019t allow that. I think it\u2019s more like I think that \u2013 (pause). [24:46] It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">more that I think that it will be frightening to you in some way. Or like, too much for you. What I want to say is like, I\u2019m sort of casting it in the light of an inappropriate relationship, because it feels like anything would be too much for you. I don\u2019t think I said that right. (pause) [25:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well, I haven\u2019t thought of any questions. The first is I don\u2019t usually ask questions. But I had an impression that in a way, some of this is very clear in your mind and it\u2019s very hard to say which is different from like, having thoughts that feel very disorganized or have formed for nonsensical <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">where, I probably would intend to ask questions. I guess I want to explain that to make it clear that I think at times, you worry about not being clear. I can imagine my asking questions would convey like, I need you to be clear. But it\u2019s more like, with what we\u2019re talking about now, it seems like it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">would make it easier for you to say what you\u2019re trying to say. That\u2019s why I\u2019m explaining myself. [27:40] And the thing that I am not, according to what you said, is the relation between how on one side what you feel \u2013 what you are feeling about me would be overwhelming. For me it would be too much. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200733\">And something about an inappropriateness in our relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562450\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it seems like \u2013 So as I try to like, construct your mind, I \u2013 what sort of comes to mind for me over and over is like, well, if I say that I care about him, Chad will think that I care about him in these ways that are not appropriate. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually accurate, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">but then it doesn\u2019t go away when I say well, I don\u2019t think I really need to worry about that. [29:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: There are two worries there if I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that like, so it feels to me like, really I\u2019m just worried that like, my caring about you at all or needing you at all will be too much for you. But that\u2019s not something that makes quite as much sense on the surface. So I guess I do have both of those worries, but the one is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">sort of standing in place of the other. Does that make more sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I think so. What I\u2019ve got is that the first worry is that I will misconstrue you as having romantic feelings for me which I guess -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: I guess I also do worry that I have romantic feelings for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re terrified about that. [30:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s really scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: And you seem to have the idea that that would be inappropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do. That\u2019s another one that like, when I talk sense to myself, it doesn\u2019t go away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: And then the other worry which you kind of in a way like, agree with more or are more invested in than with the first two. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just feel a little foolish, that\u2019s all. [31:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Because of being inconsistent in a way? Why worry about this, but I kind of know otherwise, but I still worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Both because being inconsistent and because of sort of like, I feel I\u2019m sort of desperately trying to present this to you in a way that does not leave open the possibility of what I\u2019m worried about is actually founded in anything. (pause) [32:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I kind of understand that for you the thought of having romantic feelings for me is a terrifying worry. And it\u2019s unclear if you\u2019re kind of pushing back on it because it\u2019s terrifying or because they\u2019re there in a way that you kind of haven\u2019t let yourself see or something like that. [33:27] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">And what seems clear is that you\u2019re also worried that \u2013 like it\u2019s almost a done deal that having contact with and relying on me is going to go away. Or, I won\u2019t be here in the same way. [34:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: This is less scary than I was expecting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m rereading Jayne Eyre. Have you read it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: A long time ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so good. It\u2019s a waste on the high schoolers. But at the same time, it\u2019s perfect for high schoolers. High school girls anyway. I don\u2019t; think boys should have to read it. It\u2019s just so much a book for girls. I think basically, every high school girl that I\u2019ve talked to like, loves it. [35:44] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">It\u2019s always one of the most popular books of the year. Every boy that I\u2019ve talked to who had to read it in high school is like, this is stupid. They hated it. It\u2019s so good. I don\u2019t know. I got very upset and fragile over the beginning part where she\u2019s a child. (pause) Where she\u2019s basically neglected <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200992\">and abused. I remember, I think I was like, 12 or 13 the first time I read it. And she\u2019s ten in the book.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562450\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">And it just felt like so much my experience. [36:47] Especially that it wasn\u2019t until I read it as an adult that I feel I sort of got it. You know, the character is kind of a bad ass. She\u2019s this very impressive person. (pause) [37:39] It\u2019s just this very strong sense of injustice in it. She\u2019s this child <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">and she just knows that the way that she\u2019s treated is not right and she knows that they\u2019re not being fair to her. And she knows that she\u2019s not being treated well. And she\u2019s really angry about it and there\u2019s nothing she can do. [38:57] But that\u2019s not related to me. (pause) [39:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s interesting the way that it comes up along with you are thinking about strong feelings about me. I guess I\u2019m thinking something along the lines of, those are both sort of strong positions that I think you have often distanced yourself from. [40:57] And maybe that\u2019s more that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">both put your strong feelings right in the middle of things in a way that I think is hard for you to do and at times to the extent that you don\u2019t really want to know what they are. [41:44] I think often it\u2019s in part because of a fear of what they\u2019ll do to others around or with what they have done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m worrying about I guess sort of the same thing. Both the same thing you\u2019re talking about and the same thing as always of like, what James needs from me right now is for me not to fall apart, and I don\u2019t know if I can do that. [42:56] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
