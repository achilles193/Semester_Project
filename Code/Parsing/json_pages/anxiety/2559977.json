I don't know how far the Square is but the Square is like the bane of my existence. I've been in like two accidents there. This guy cut me off and then I cut him off but there was potholes, and I got a flat in the potholes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: How the hell do you get from Dunmore to here in twenty one minutes? That's amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Well that's not that amazing. Dunmore's far culturally but it's not that far physically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: How many miles is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: It's five and a half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: That's still pretty fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: It's fast with a flat tire, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: But you got a flat tire in the square? Where?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Well, just before, there's that, it's like a gas station across from a police station.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: And that street that sort of curves down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: So I was passing somebody near the gas station. My tires must have a little low pressure or something like that and got caught in the pothole. So I just leaned on the front tire mostly. I have to see if the rim's damaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Oh. (pause) Is it patchable or do you (inaudible at 00:03:08).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I didn't stop to [patch it.] (ph) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And it's five miles. Is that as the crow flies or is five miles of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Road. (pause) I know you're my best fan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: (laughs) That seems very fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: It was nineteen, then twenty three, then twenty, then eighteen miles an hour and then ten and seven with a flat tire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: Is that right? So you could've just shaved off two or three minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, it would have been a record.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: That application is good for grocery shopping and just things that are like very mundane become like speed contests. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: I like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">THERAPIST: What's the app?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT: Map My Run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">THERAPIST: What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">CLIENT: Map My Run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">THERAPIST: Map by?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">CLIENT: Map My Run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Map My Run. Is it pretty accurate, you think, the odometer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. You tell it when to start. If I designed it I would have it check in every ten seconds on your location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's how it does it? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. So I sort of like hollowed out my past this past weekend. So I had some stuff I could do with the bikes and it seemed kind of boring, just for my actual customers, not the customers from the church. Two customers that dropped off their bike and they're just like, \"Oh, we want to use <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200711\">someone local. Just tell us, whatever, how much it costs whenever you want.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">So I just decided not to work on those. So I abandoned those two bikes and a tricycle, an antique tricycle, I'm fixing. And I just rented a car and went to Vancouver for the jazz festival.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh. huh. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: I rented a car before because I knew I would need it. I was supposed to use the car to drop off the bikes that are (inaudible at 00:05:54) or something and I also had to deliver some other stuff. So the rental is basically paid for through, I mean in my mind, through work I was doing. But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">took it to Vancouver. The Ford Fiesta's pretty good. It got like thirty eight miles per gallon for the whole trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. [You can't get that out of any engine.] (ph) You keep the mileage per gallon pretty low.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: That's good. It's not a hybrid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: I don't know. It seems a little slow to start like when you take your foot off the brake, there's like a second pause and then it sort of goes. So maybe it's a hybrid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: I don't know though. It has to be to get that kind of mileage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: That's really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: I guess maybe on the highway you can get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well, highways are supposed to be better and the city's really great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: The thing is when they're idling they don't use gas I guess, or they try not to use gas. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: Right, yeah. Anyway, I just went up, I went up by Bar Harbor. My cousin Victoria lives up there. So I called her at midnight on Saturday, just about exactly midnight. I said, \"I'm in Bar Harbor and I'd like to see you.\" And, you know, I don't She doesn't typically She gets annoyed with people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F1\">for lots of things because she has a very high standard, but she's pretty good at sort of letting it go. (laughs) Or just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: Tolerating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Right, exactly. I could tell she wasn't too pleased to be called at midnight on a Saturday night. You know, I asked her to go out, \"Let's go out on the town.\" She said, \"I just got back from town.\" I said, \"Well let's go out \" [I didn't say this.] (ph) Eventually, we ended up going for pizza <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200931\">and I had already had pizza. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">And also, I mean, she has a boyfriend. So he was there. So I was calling at midnight and he said she should go when she left. But to her, I don't know, she seemed kind of annoyed and I imagine that's part of the reason. It's unusual that, you know, I have a claim on these women. Well, my blood I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200951\">but, you know, I got her to leave her house at midnight on Saturday night and she had already been out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: Still, I mean I talked to her a little bit. It was a decent conversation but I was exhausted. I couldn't sleep the night before. I had energy but nothing to do with it. It's just, I forget the night, but I don't think it was eventful. But I didn't make plans, I didn't do anything. I was at home. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200991\">I probably should have gone out and done something because I just had energy and I wasn't <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">Well anyway, I asked her out at midnight and we went to this pizza place. Maybe it was just my sleepless mind but I felt like, it hadn't occurred to me, but this wasn't (inaudible at 00:09:43). It was late. Well, I definitely felt like I was imposing but (coughs) I felt like it was kind of a [mindset <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B1\">of then drifting apart] (ph). Nothing on the surface would reveal that, it's just I sort of take that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Mm. What was it like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: (coughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: What did you [So what's the deal with her?] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: It was good. It was interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: But she seemed kind of put upon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Put upon? (laughs) Well we started off (coughs) by talking about the Vancouver trip I tried to organize but it didn't work out. Too many people were saying different things and no one could (inaudible at 00:10:42) and people didn't want to Vancouver with just a car (ph). And she proposed an <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">alternative trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: To like Western Connecticut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: Which in my mind is like, as someone organizing something, it's like disrespectful or a pain in the ass when someone suggests something different. And she was one of the people I called before to talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: And so that was how we started our conversation. I was like, \"I had called you about it.\" And she was like, \"And I said I couldn't go.\" (laughs) And I just left it at that. Because she said that she was coming. She couldn't go this one weekend I had planned it for but she would be home this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">other week. And then it turned out no one could go the weekend she wasn't going to be there but people could go the weekends that she was going to come back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">So I naturally assumed, based on our conversation, that she would want to meet up with the rest of the cousins. But it turns out that wasn't necessarily the case. Or, I mean, she didn't want to go Vancouver at all and she just didn't say anything. You know? But that's how our conversation started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">We talked about things. We talked about church exploits. I described my work over there as like forming a cult around myself to her. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: The cult of Brandon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: So, she (coughs) (inaudible at 00:12:14) You know, as I was describing my Like I felt like I was sort of getting a handle things. I mean, ironically, I was leaving my business behind. Like the bike work I should be doing and things that were helping (inaudible), things that felt like mine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB1\">I was just sort of leaving those behind and going back to visit my old cousin Victoria in the city where I was born.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">CLIENT: But as I was describing it I just, you know, I became a little self-conscious because I was describing, you know, I feel like I'm getting it together. Like I have, you know, I'm working at the bike shop during the week and I'm fixing bikes and I'm delivering some groceries. And I guess what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF1\">I was trying to say, what's good about it is that it's mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">CLIENT: You know, it feels good to have something that's yours. But it sounded like I was saying, to me and maybe to her, I don't know. But to me it sounded like I was saying, you know, I'm bound for glory, basically. And based on the paper facts of my current activity it doesn't seem very auspicious. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C31\">But to me, I feel healthy and useful and like I'm learning, and I have lot more control over what I'm doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Maybe that's the glory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">CLIENT: It feels good. And she's from USC and she's dead sick of it. I mean she's Like everyone, the way she was saying it, is that everyone is always saying, \"Oh, I'm going to do great things here at USC.\" And I think she will do great things. I think she will because she's a cohesive person with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C71\">distinct principles that she sticks too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">But in her mind, I mean, it's possible that she could do nothing. I mean in scientific research you can study for, you know, seven years and at the end of it you find that your results are meaningless. Or, you know, what you wanted to happen didn't happen. So, uh, try something else. You know? (laughs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">You've done all these tests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: She'll find a way. I mean, she's smart enough but I understand where she's coming from generally. (inaudible at 00:14:48) First of all, you're in an institution for a certain amount of time you start to take a lot for granted. Like I jumped ship and it's pretty difficult to furnish the security <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD1\">and the stimulation of a certain kind that you receive going to a good school or working at a good school, research I guess. But, well, I don't know. I'm sure she'll see it through. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">There were good moments in our conversation. I was sort of like self I felt guilty for bringing her out there but I wouldn't, you know, confess that to her. And there were moments of candor. It's also like our lives are sort of changing. I mean she said I don't know anything about this boyfriend. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">I guess I didn't ask about him. (inaudible at 00:16:04) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Where do you see? Why do you see you guys diverging?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Well, (long pause) Hm. Well, it wasn't like She was quite tired. I could see that. I mean by the end she wasn't that tired, but she was tired. To me it could have been like a secret There could be some complicity between us in going out in the middle of the night for no reason. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">Or there could be a sense of obligation. You know, like we've had a bond and she feels obligated to come. And I sense that it's kind of the latter. You know I had this bond to tug on but it wasn't anything that was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:17:59). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: This boyfriend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Oh, I don't know. I didn't think of it then. I didn't mean to dismiss that. But, yeah, the boyfriend is something that's different because she's taking her life in She has a boyfriend, I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: And she's sort of a prude. So, if she's dating anyone she's going to be pretty serious about them, I imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: Also, part of our conversation was that she didn't feel like a real person. Or she felt a tension between being like a real person and being something great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: And she said, at the end of it, for her being a real person is probably just going to mean starting a family. I didn't start that conversation either. Yeah, so I mean there's lots more risk (ph) for future meetings but there wasn't like a kind of electricity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: And I guess there hasn't been. I mean phone conversations have been fun. It's also the fact that I'm incredibly defensive. Like the last thing she said to me on the phone, we started an hour long conversation and she was saying, \"You know, I got your voice-mail and I decided to call you back <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED1\">now because I'm going to be busy for the next few weeks, and I knew I wouldn't be able to call you in that time, so I thought I'd better call you back right away.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: So that's really nice. But the only way I interpret that is that she won't call me for the next three weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Well yeah.

What about the electricity not being there? You know, that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Did it kind of like bum you out? Were you hoping that it would be there and it wasn't? And do you feel she's holding back? What did it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Um.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah, were you looking for electricity with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: I don't know what I was looking for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I was looking for something. I mean she was in Southern Oregon and it was good to see her once a year. I was looking for something. Yeah, and it wasn't there. It was painful but it wasn't there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">THERAPIST: And you were saying, was it like erotic excitement?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">CLIENT: I mean she's What are you saying? She's like a Virgin Mary -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: in my own personal constellation of things. Erotic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Or sexual tension. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: It's weird, I do talk to her about that stuff a lot more. But it's one of those wonderful things where it's not really a possibility. Yeah, it's not like that. But the, you know, an eagerness to commune with someone. [I expected that much.] (ph) Yeah, that seems good. But I mean, the other side <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201151\">of it is, interestingly, you know I've been planning this trip about going to Vancouver for a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">And I was thinking, you know, I was planning on going early Saturday morning actually but, I don't know what happened, I got a late start. So I ended up leaving around four or something, maybe five. I don't know when I left. It must have been (inaudible at 00:22:15). But actually I don't know how I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">got up there at midnight. I must have left at like eight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">Oh yeah, I stopped at home too. I stopped at home, my parents were out. My parents were out because they were going to Bar Harbor to pick up my sister and her boyfriend. So my parents were in the same city that night and they were staying in a hotel and actually (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Glad you didn't run into them at the pizza place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. I was leaving with Victoria and she's like, \"Well, your family is somewhere around here.\" I think they went to (inaudible at 00:22:50). And I didn't want to see them. Yeah, I mean I could have easily gone to my aunt's house and seen them and the rest of my (inaudible) and her <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D1\">boyfriend. So, yeah, that was I mean there were like ten people I know or, you know, ten people in my family and (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">Yeah I know you'd like for it to be something erotic. But I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: No, well listen. You know, actually what I'm thinking of is What I'm suggesting is that, I guess I raised the erotic element because it's been there in the past somehow. Maybe it's not erotic, not to say erotic but sexual tension. What it made me think of is, one, is that I think you really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201211\">wanted to have some sort of, you know, contact with a woman that feels like she really kind of gets it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: And you feel close with her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: And I think, you know, another way to feel And you guys talking about who you are really as opposed to How did she frame the kind of the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">THERAPIST: either real or success? Is that -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Something like that. Just being great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Being great or real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: Well wanting to be close with her on the basis of realness. And I think one way, I was thinking about, I guess it made me think about your birthday and wanting a woman to come over and be with you. And I think it had a lot to do with, as you were sort of suggesting, about you being alone <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201351\">and wanting to commune with a woman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">Wanting somebody who would want to be there, not because of some sort of greatness but because of real body to body contact. Something real. Just like dancing. There's something about dancing that is frickin' real because it's bodies. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: And I think in a way I was just thinking, well, there's something about this cousin of yours that, you know, if sex is another way to sort of commune to be real with one another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: I think you really, really are on the search for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. (pause) There was a little bit. There's like little flashes. You know, it wouldn't be kind of a fiery light you can sit around but it was just like sparks. Sparks usually mean it's like something exciting, but in this case it's like a lighter running out of fluid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: Hm. Moments of candor with this (inaudible at 00:26:21). Little sparks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah, we had a good parting (ph), I think. (pause) Oh yeah, I sort of confessed a pettiness to her as well. Like I'm getting all these petty, petty contests. Like whether it's for the car on the street or with a coworker, or with you maybe, or my roommate. It's all these pride contests or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201451\">And I think when I smoked weed it sort of did away with that, maybe because I was so helpless mentally that I had no choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">But I do feel like an inordinate amount of my focus is kind of like, \"Am I better than this person or lesser, or how do I get the upper hand or show this person.\" I mean I got my flat tire trying to show a driver. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Trying to what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: Teach the driver a lesson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: But I guess I did but I still got a flat tire. I went from there, after that I sorted of texted Hermione (ph) and I said, you know I asked her if that guest bed in her apartment is still available. Because according to Victoria she and my sister work (ph) a lot in the town. I didn't want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F1\">see my sister and Charles, her boyfriend, because at our last meeting I felt like I've been closer to my sister and he was kind of helpless and I wanted to keep it that way. So I didn't want to screw that up in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: Like I said, I was very tired and sleepless and I didn't feel connected to anybody or anything. I didn't feel healthy. But anyway, I just texted Hermione (ph) and I didn't get a response. So after waiting all day I just decided to I didn't decide to, I was just dead tired, so I just slept <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201531\">in the car. And it's weird because I know one guy who lives like, someone from the church who has a summer home about ten minutes way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">And there was my parents staying in a hotel there. And there was my aunt's house where Victoria and her boyfriend were staying. You know, that's why I just slept in the car. I slept for about two and half hours so I didn't think of it as such. It was just like a break. I woke up with the sunrise and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201551\">drove up to Vancouver for the jazz fest. I was a little tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20154-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20154-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: What did I do? (pause) Yeah. I visited a nice park and sort of laid down for a bit, walked around, looked at the people. Beautiful people in a different way. Like here, you know, you can't generalize people, but people may have beautiful bodies up here, but the way people are beautiful up there <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201591\">is the way they move. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: There's like a grace in their compassion for themselves and that's really a stuck up -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Grace in there, what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: I said in their compassion towards themselves. But that's really a stuck up, Amherst way of saying it. It's just like, it is, it's the grace of their movement that's beautiful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: Hm. Compassion to themselves. In the sense that they care about their bodies?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">CLIENT: No, that they don't care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">THERAPIST: They don't care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: (laughs) You know, the jazz fest was alright but it was good music. I also, I climbed a mountain. I hit on this eighteen year old. She started walking at the same time I did. I asked how old she was, she was taken aback at first but then she was like eighteen. \"Why do you ask?\" And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D1\">\"I was just wondering.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">We had a good conversation and then she told me where her apartment was. And she said she was, she was quiet (ph). In Vancouver there's this like, from the mountain, there's this balcony that you can look out over the whole city. It's really beautiful. And she said, \"You know, people don't know it but <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F1\">that's (inaudible at 00:31:28) from my apartment.\" [So I sort of had fun with being a stalker.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">At this point the logical course of action for me to take was to say, you know, ask her to show me her apartment. But instead I asked her if she wanted to go to the jazz festival, which she had already been too but I wasn't listening or I didn't remember. Which is forgivable the first time, but I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201711\">think she liked that. (inaudible at 00:32:03) So it didn't pan out as it might have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: Why did you want to go back to her Or did you want to go back to her place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: I didn't know what I wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: You know, at this point I'm just talking to random people in the street, you know, hitting on attractive strangers. (laughs) And also seeing people mulling around, like I see a face and I'm like, \"Oh, is that that person that I know?\" Like I thought I saw, on the way down the mountain, I thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201791\">I saw my French teacher from tenth grade. Or I thought I saw someone who looked like Leonard Cohen. You know, all these Jewish people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">I'm not even joking, like every old man. Maybe they tried to (inaudible at 00:32:56).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: I don't know if you know what I mean, but you're just walking in the city and someone looks sort of like someone you remember and you latch onto that and you think it might be them, and you look close and it's not them.

I wound meeting a girl at the cafe and I asked her to read my horoscope because it was in French. And it said that I (inaudible at 00:34:06). I put too much I think it meant too much, it wasn't clear to me whether it meant too much or a lot of energy into my appearance. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B1\">And so people would notice that.

Yeah I also, she was pissed. Yeah, I was (laughs) There was one woman that talked to me. It was really nice but I didn't have the energy to It's interesting because I'm in this mode where I'm thinking like, it's like you say, I'm looking for <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201931\">some contact with a woman, meaningful contact or possibly something possibly that's pretty deep. You know, that's just an easy way of saying that I'm looking for meaningful contact. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: And Leonard Cohen too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: I guess. But this woman just sort of remarked that I was, I think she was making fun of me for eating a hot dog, some gay undertones to the joke. And we just stopped at like a street I passed by with like a hundred other people. But we were at the fountain (ph) and she was saying (laughs) (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201971\">at 00:35:37) some noise I made. And she was saying, \"Oh, you like that,\" or something, \"from the noise you're making.\" I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">And she had some flowers, so I said, \"Where'd you get those flowers?\" And she said, \"Oh, I'm going to meet my mother. I haven't seen her in a long time. These are for her. So I'm very excited to be seeing my mother.\" And then she introduced herself and I was eating a hotdog, you know, and I was licking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201991\">ketchup off my finger when she introduced herself. She gave me her hand and she said, \"I'm Barbara.\" And she said, \"How would I \" When I shook it her hand it was too strong or something like it. So she introduced herself and then she ran away.

No, it's playful though because I mean why would you introduce yourself and then run away? There's no reason to introduce yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: It's just being like It's insulting and I liked it.

Where you do the opposite of what you want to do for fear of the way she -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: Oh. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: She runs away after flirting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: \"I'm going to see my mother.\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Of course I, that's something like would do too or Christina. She would always say, \"Oh, I have to talk to my Mom on the phone.\" (laughs) And then what's interesting about it, I'm pretty sure, I mean it seems obvious in retrospect, but her father is working for her mother. It's just another <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B11\">way of making fun of me or just being sort of ridiculous. I like that very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Teasing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I think I do that a lot, a lot. I told her, I said, \"Well, one of the reasons I came up here is I'm really tired and I need to rest. So, you know, if you want to do something in the next two hours just call the number.\" Yeah, and then I hit on some other <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB1\">young girl. I was crazed (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BD\">Like just on the street these older women who were walking with us, an older woman and then there's this younger Asian girl.

The fear of my vulnerability in transgressing, or fear of rejection or reaction might come sort of conflates with a general fear about, I don't know, a general fear for my safety. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you've done something against the law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">CLIENT: Yeah, so that was just one day, Sunday, I stayed there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">CLIENT: It was good.

There was also a woman, who was the first person I saw, and she waved at me and I don't know why. I don't know if that's common. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201E91\">But that's happened too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Hm.

Like you think everyone is looking at you but it's really just a way of like buttressing your ego or like your idea of yourself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED1\">Like your identity in a sea of indifference.

Yeah, this makes me kind of think about it's your motherland and you're not sure if you belong there or not. Or it welcomes you in and then it's dried up or something. It's exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2020F\">CLIENT: Are you trying to connect \"motherland\" to my mother? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20211\">THERAPIST: Well, mother is a symbol of something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20213\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20215\">THERAPIST: Something that gives you a lot of like Well, talk about communion.

It's like I can't drive this straight six hours, especially on little sleep, two and a half hours of sleep or whatever. So I decided to stop in Bar Harbor and I figured we might <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2021F1\">go out somewhere. (laughs) There's one, there's one (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20221\">Okay, so there was one other girl I hit on successfully, but it didn't work because I was meeting Victoria that night.

Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2023B\">CLIENT: And she sort of like excused herself.

[What was I going to say? But I would go back there.] (ph) I think What did I do? I texted her and I'm like, \"Passing through Bar Harbor. Let me know if you want to meet for a few minutes.\" I also left a voice-mail. No response. And Kaitlyn is kind of that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2023F1\">way. In fact that's one of the things that came up with Victoria is that, you know, she never returns anyone's calls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20241\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20243\">CLIENT: But still, I mean, to me that's I don't like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20245\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20247\">CLIENT: But I ended up, oh my God, yeah, it was beautiful right then. But there was just like this I don't know, this girl, I wasn't that attracted, but she was waiting on me. And I asked her the perfect place that she ever goes to eat. And she did, so I went there and that place was closed. So I <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202471\">just walked down the street got a nice sandwich. I was damn hungry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20249\">Then I went to this other place, where the girl who I met previously worked.

You know? I didn't really want to go alone. But she said she was working and where she works is the Pancake House. So I had gone up there but I decided <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2024D1\">to go to The Pancake House.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">But, you know, obviously she was working in the morning so she wasn't still there. It wasn't obvious but it was probable. It was a very nice place. I just had like three buckets of coffee though because I needed it to stay awake while I was going to drive home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20251\">And so I was turning over the whole trip in my mind. I mean this is, I previously, like a month I faced like two pretty big, disheartening failures in the previous month. That was a failure to get a birthday party together and a failure to organize the Vancouver trip with my cousins. And they were <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202511\">sort of like, it was sort of blows to my social ego conscious, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20253\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">CLIENT: So I was sort of turning this over and it did seem to me like I had sort of hollowed out my past. Like I had gone up there and I had spoken to Em (ph), but I didn't consider that a loss or any kind of closed door. But I hadn't visited the rest of my family. I had gone to my birth city and, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202551\">know, not [found it all] (ph) there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20256-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20256-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559977\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20259\">CLIENT: And kind of actually find myself doing almost the same thing I had done four years ago, sort of wandering around the streets alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025D\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:49:55) I mean I'd like to turn that at some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2025F\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. But looking, on looking, looking for something that will take you more in and sustain it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20261\">CLIENT: Yeah. And this woman, the woman at the Pancake House, like throughout the day these women are looking at me with something that ranges from interest to, I don't think I can say \"desire,\" but a physical interest. And I don't capitalize on it, or I don't know how to, or I don't, I don't know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202611\">I don't take in their signals as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20263\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, and I think too that maybe some of it is a bit of some anxiety that arises when you want to, you know, take that last kind of leap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20265\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean especially with the girl, which is the closest I got that weekend on the mountain. I don't even know that I want sex or where I want to take it. Because my own experience has just been terrible with anyone I've become intimate with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20267\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20269\">CLIENT: Whether it be my mother or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026D\">CLIENT: I mean everyone except Victoria, I guess. You know, if I've ever become intimate with them it's just been horribly painful for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2026F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20271\">CLIENT: And grotesque.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20273\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20275\">CLIENT: But I left the Pancake Houseand, you know, twenty minutes later we were texting back saying like, \"Are you still in Bar Harbor. I just left my home which is in (inaudible at 00:51:37).\" So it's ten, ten-twenty-three on Sunday night. I'm tired as fuck. I just drank three coffees and I'm heading <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202751\">home, and she texts me right then. So I guess we're out of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20277\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but what were you going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20279\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B\">THERAPIST: She texted you that or you texted her that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D\">CLIENT: She texted me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027F\">THERAPIST: Oh, she was also drinking coffee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20281\">CLIENT: No, no, I drank three cups of coffee.
