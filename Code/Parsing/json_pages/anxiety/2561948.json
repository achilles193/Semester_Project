I was in model U.N. which is out at Brown. And so a bunch of us were all out here dressed in suits and what not. And I walked up to the guy and said, \u201cCan I buy a Playboy please?\u201d He looks at me, turns around, grabs one real quick, throws it in a paper bag. [0:01:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">There you go. (inaudible) Thank you. And I was like; \u201cIt was that easy!\u201d But at other times I would steal them.

(inaudible) \u201cDo you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">want to come back and steal more stuff?\u201d So I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah sure!

And it was all crap. Like whatever was leftover from \u2013 an expandable line hamper. It was just the exercise of doing. [0:02:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: The fun.

Like \u201cDo you see how easy this is?\u201d So people say, \u201cWell if you walk with confidence you can (inaudible at 0:02:29)\u201d That\u2019s true actually. If you walk with confidence and purpose as if you\u2019re going somewhere people just assume you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">what you\u2019re doing. (inaudible at 0:02:37) \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have stolen that.

(inaudible at 0:02:47) Same thing with \u2013 there was other (inaudible) too. They were selling plants outside. (inaudible at 0:02:54) or something. (inaudible) come out. And there were people around and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh do you guys have the receipt?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOh <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">great good.

So I wrote a story yesterday which made Ginny very upset. (inaudible at 0:03:40) for right now. It got popular very quickly. And (inaudible at 0:03:52) for real this time. But I\u2019m mournful. I write under the name Mournful. (inaudible at 0:03:58) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">But it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s a little thousand-word thing. And people really liked it.

And \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. The other thing I was thinking as we were talking just yesterday briefly \u2013 I\u2019ve done this for people \u2013. Is that if you ever wanted Ginny to come in and for me to help her understand a little bit more of what she could do to be helpful when you are in those moments I\u2019d be happy to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200891\">it.

And so that\u2019s to be expected. I go down. And I\u2019m still not totally up today. I\u2019m (inaudible at 0:07:50) angry today. I did a couple of quick strikes to the bathroom door because it wouldn\u2019t latch properly. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F1\">Just with a palm hand not with the elbows which would have shattered the doors. Because they\u2019re not very good doors. They\u2019re 1950s doors. (inaudible) So this is short so I can read it if you don\u2019t mind. So you can get a sense of what I was (inaudible) [0:08:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: I mean (inaudible at 0:08:22) Sherlock canon at all. Like the basic stories of Sherlock?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Some of them, yeah. It\u2019s been awhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: The major high points of Sherlock, right? (inaudible at 0:08:31) John Watson is his doctor and best friend. His \u201ctiger\u201d as he calls him. Moriarti is arch nemesis. And when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was sick of writing Sherlock, he had Sherlock and Moriarti fight to the death. And mutually assured <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">destruction. (inaudible at 0:08:51) And but then people were like, \u201cWhat the fuck? We want more Sherlock.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">So two years later he\u2019s like, \u201cFine.\u201d And he started writing more Sherlock stories. (inaudible) Sherlock said, \u201cYes I faked my death. And I was gone for two years because my brother (inaudible at 0:09:08) was helping me dismantle Moriarti\u2019s web of crime across the globe. And sorry I lied to John, my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">best friend.\u201d John takes it very well. Then during that time, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle decided John would get married to a woman named Mary. [0:09:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">And after three stories with her it, he was like, \u201cThis is not working.\u201d So he kills her. And has John move back in with Sherlock. But those are some of the major things is that Sherlock fakes his death. It takes a very emotional toll on John. And John does get married to a woman named Mary. And at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">this point in the story their life has really become their life. They\u2019re going to have a baby. His life is separating from Sherlock\u2019s. And Sherlock\u2019s \u2013 and so that\u2019s where I come in in modern day Sherlock. [0:10:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">It\u2019s called, \u201cFor Real This Time\u201d. Written by Mournful. Sherlock has a gun in his mouth and his thumb on the trigger. It\u2019s a shotgun because his research has determined this is the best tool for the job. Ninety nine point five percent chance of success. On a scale from one to one hundred, shot gun to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">the head only ranks a five on the (inaudible at 0:10:35) scale. It\u2019s an older gun. It hasn\u2019t seen much use but he\u2019s checked action and he\u2019s confident it will fire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">The shells he\u2019s purchased are the perfect choice for the job. He considered pellets. But even buckshot might not have enough momentum to blow straight through his skull and take out the medulla oblongata. That of course is the most important bit. Otherwise there is a zero point five percent chance he\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F1\">survive. He can\u2019t imagine a worse hell than that. To attempt to shuffle off the mortal coil and find yourself stuck all the same. Except now you\u2019re too incapacitated to finish the job properly. Trapped forever in (inaudible) his mind inhabits. [0:11:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">So as to be sure he\u2019s purchased slugs instead of shot. One large piece of lead to fly through the back of mouth through his brain stem, out the other side of his skull and then on to the ceiling. Perhaps even the attic. He doesn\u2019t (inaudible at 0:11:19) to be there. Not that it would matter if this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">works. It only matters if he survives. The thought comforts him. Nothing matters so long as this works. And it will because he\u2019s done his research. He takes the gun metal in his mouth. He\u2019s beginning to salivate because his mouth is mostly open. He doesn\u2019t want the drool stains on the carpet but he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A12\">not quite ready. He thinks to himself that he could have planned these steps better but it\u2019s a lie.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561948\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">For weeks now he\u2019s been planning this. In the times of fear. Even hesitation but he knows he\u2019s one of those rare individuals who can defeat his own will to survive. One of the few with the strength to plan this and carry it out. He would chuckle were it not for the shotgun barrel in his mouth. The great <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">Sherlock Holmes, already singled out for his intelligence, found himself a member of a slightly less exclusive club. Those who could do it. Those for even a moment could overcome that deep-seated will to live. [0:12:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">Sherlock had always heard of those who committed suicide as weak or cowardly. It was for the people who would say such things for whom Sherlock held the deepest contempt. Suicide, he reasoned, takes strength. Cowardice is continuing to live in a world that no longer holds anything for you. His world <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">was empty now. There have been lies. Sincere lies but Sherlock recognized them for what they were. His complete isolation had been inevitable. John was the only person who could make him feel a connection he supposed. Mary was clever enough but they (inaudible at 0:12:42) now.

He found it odd that such things were even \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t be here to suffer with John. He would feel no pain. He would feel nothing. He simply wouldn\u2019t be. He liked that. He reached down with the other hand to grab <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">his phone. He\u2019d written a note \u2013 as people do \u2013 and prepared to send it to John. He\u2019d written it in one go and certainly didn\u2019t have time for edits now but he thought it best to check it over at least once. [0:13:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">And the letter begins: \u201cDear John, What a stupid way to start a letter. A letter. Although I suppose it at least somewhat appropriate considering the \u201cDear John\u201d style of letter is a holdover from the previous century when people wrote letters on paper like cavemen. Honestly. I\u2019m sorry I was distracted. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">Getting back on point. This style of letter was often a way of saying, \u201cI\u2019m leaving you.\u201d So I suppose this is an appropriate opening after all because I am leaving you. Leaving everyone.

Not to say only you but rather to say you\u2019re the only one I\u2019d miss <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A92\">if missing someone when dead were possible. Perhaps it is. I doubt it. I tell you (inaudible at 0:13:57) it will. Please feel free to be as furious with me as you like.

He put the phone on the floor and made sure to angle the barrel correctly. And forced his thumb to steady itself. This was going to take some concentration. He waited a few seconds (inaudible at 0:15:27) before the other end of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">the line picked up. As soon as he heard a human voice he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">And that\u2019s the most popular thing on that site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Mm.

Interacting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: Then I\u2019m like \u2013 my old boss, Kim, found one of my posts yesterday and went and liked it. I was like \u2013 I wasn\u2019t expecting her to ever see anything I posted. But because you know how your feed works, right? It\u2019s like it starts selecting people you interact and shows you their feed. [0:23:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s how Facebook filters out what you see. And you (inaudible at 0:23:28). But in any case \u2013 and a lot of women liked it. Because it started, \u201cFat is a boom!\u201d And it was just about my experience in [pandamonia] (sp). I was reading an article the other day (inaudible at 0:23:50) about a man <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B1\">declared a (inaudible at 0:23:52). And as often happens when my long held patriarchy supported views are challenged, I\u2019m a bit taken aback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">But then I use the powers of reason and logic and hardwired emotion of compassion to see your point. My wish was that simply declaring (inaudible at 0:24:13) and saying, \u201cYes therefore men and women should be equal is not enough.\u201d You have to realize that inequality is an enormous problem which must <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D1\">be solved. Right? And so that\u2019s a really good point. So I\u2019m trying to better at this. [0:24:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">Like for instance (inaudible at 0:24:30) the other day \u2013 my favorite game store.

Not increasingly irrelevant video game stores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">THERAPIST: That is just \u2013 Pandemonium\u2019s just a gaming \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20140-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20140-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561948\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s down \u2013 it\u2019s in Central.

But I\u2019m down there. And then there is just this group of dudes. Young twenty somethings talking about women and girls. (inaudible at 0:25:13) girls because they don\u2019t understand the distinction between sixteen year old women and fifteen year old girls. But yeah. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F1\">(inaudible). [0:25:26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">I\u2019m walking through and this one dude (inaudible at 0:25:33) discussion. \u201cGirls are crazy because of x.\u201d And blah, blah, blah. Totally like misogynistic, ignorant shit. (inaudible at 0:25:42) And part of me is like; \u201cYou should do something.\u201d But I was late. I had somewhere to be. I forget where. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201511\">might have been (inaudible at 0:25:55). But I was late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">(inaudible at 0:26:02) And finally it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah I fucking hate lesbians. Because they won\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d And as soon as I walked over to him and his circle of friends some of them started chuckling along. (inaudible at 0:26:20) nervous laughter because they know this guy is an asshole. But he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201531\">in a room full of introverts so like no one is going to challenge him. [0:26:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: So not being an introvert I just walked up. (inaudible at 0:26:34) as much disgust as I can. (inaudible) \u201cDude.\u201d He tries that thing where (inaudible at 0:26:43) eye contact with me. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d Some of the people I\u2019ve met who think they\u2019re the scariest people in the world can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201571\">make eye contact with me when it\u2019s a straight out battle of wills. It\u2019s like I grew up with a psychotic mother.

So and it couldn\u2019t hold the gaze for more than a few seconds. And then looked away. And looked down. I was like \u2013 all the other guys were like \u201cHuh.\u201d Great okay. I said, \u201cSo hopefully I did some good. I hopefully I made him realize he needs to think about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201631\">stuff. Hopefully I gave support to those guys who wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t.\u201d Right? To show them that there are people who will stand up and do these things. But what I wish I had done is busted into that circle and destroyed him. [0:27:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: Just with the power of words. I was like \u2013 I looked at him. Based on his stance, his build and his (inaudible at 0:27:55) intellect, there was no scenario in which I would not have beat him. Right? So but I was late. I\u2019ll try to do better next time. And a lot of responses from women are like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201671\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Look you\u2019re one of the good ones.\u201d And like the very fact that you worry if you\u2019re doing the right means you\u2019re probably doing it right. But it was fun to see my old boss come in and be like, \u201cYeah.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">THERAPIST: Mm. Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">CLIENT: But that wasn\u2019t a fighting one. I started a fighting one on ad blockers. And quitting ad blockers. And using ad blockers to theft. Which some people really don\u2019t appreciate. Because they want to use their ad blockers.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2016A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561948\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Oh I see.

You need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: It\u2019s all starting through Facebook.

It\u2019s all day.\u201d And then like twenty responses of defense by these individuals on Facebook. And I\u2019m like; \u201cI\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201771\">judging it.\u201d (inaudible at 0:29:13) \u201cI don\u2019t care that you do this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

But it\u2019s all quiet. You don\u2019t have to listen to it. And a lot of it is actually work communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">THERAPIST: There is all this stuff to suggest it\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">CLIENT: It is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: That people\u2019s productivity isn\u2019t affected.

I was like, \u201cListen. You can be a smoker and take your breaks. Or you can take your Internet breaks. But you don\u2019t get to do both.\u201d Right. If you\u2019re a non-smoker, take Internet breaks. If you\u2019re a smoker, take your smoke breaks. Those <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201971\">are your breaks. But yeah don\u2019t be a smoker and surfing the net because now you\u2019re actually \u2013 now there is like a good hour and a half out of the day you\u2019re not actually working. And I need you to be here for about eight and be productive for most of those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">I was a smoker for a lot of that time too. So you know I was like, \u201cYeah go on smoke breaks.\u201d (inaudible at 0:31:09) Did I also surf the web? Yeah because I got bored. So I\u2019m sure those smokers surf the web too. And so the other ones will surf longer. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhatever. We always got our shit done <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201991\">and on time.\u201d There was one problem one time. And I fixed it. There was this thing called Puppy Cam. It\u2019s a live streaming cam to like a group of puppies. You could just watch all day. And [], I.T. guy, is like \u201cHey man, there is a lot of bandwidth being (inaudible) down in your building.\u201d I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201992\">\u201cOh yeah?\u201d [0:31:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">He\u2019s like, \u201cA lot of people are streaming something.\u201d I\u2019m like; \u201cI\u2019ll fix this.\u201d So I write a thing like, \u201cHey guys.

So no more Puppy Cam. Forever. Sorry. Done.\u201d And that was it. That was it. No more Puppy Cam. Some people were upset but I\u2019m like there is a logical reason for doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

You know just to say one other thing. Do with it what you want but I would think that there might be some benefit just in doing something part time.

It\u2019s like being out \u2013 even if it\u2019s fifteen hours a week. It\u2019ll help. Even if it\u2019s not any money either. It\u2019s more about just having something where you feel like you\u2019re out of the house.

That\u2019s why you don\u2019t see pet stores <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201F71\">anymore because they\u2019re fucking evil. And but that\u2019s why we\u2019re sure why he\u2019s terrified of vehicles. Of being in vehicles. It\u2019s like a really stressful thing. I had to take him to the vet last week to get his butt expressed. Disgusting. [0:38:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Butt expressed?

And will actually start scooting their butt along the carpet. That\u2019s why. Because it\u2019s irritating to them. And so you take the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB1\">to the vet and the vet cleans them out. And it\u2019s like $25 bucks and it\u2019s well worth it. The vet is like \u2013 the vet is always like, \u201cYou know we can teach you how to do this at home.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNope.

Your assistant keeps <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF1\">telling me I can learn to do this at home.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo. No. No. A butt this size. You go off like a shotgun.
