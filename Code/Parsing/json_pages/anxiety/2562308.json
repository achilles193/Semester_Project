That\u2019s horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: It is horrible. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Let me also just bring up, [either now] (ph) or another time, but the names for (inaudible at 00:02:34) is probably like a bit of a conversation that\u2019s not a (inaudible at 00:02:39).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it\u2019s probably\u2014yeah. I need (ph) talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Okay. Like now, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Like, yeah. In a few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Or today. (Pause) His name is Bryan and he\u2019s the boyfriend of my best friend in my program. So we\u2019re [all really friends] (ph) with one person in my program, Erica. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">And she and Bryan have been together for almost the whole time that we\u2019ve been in graduate school. Bryan is so wonderful and gentle. Very much like Jeremy, in some ways. He was Stanford educated. And has that sort of Stanford (inaudible at 00:04:07). He\u2019s studying Human evolution at Yale by way of looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">at teeth of very very big mammal, like sheep. He has his colony of sheep that he\u2019s been taking care of daily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">Anyway, he\u2014yeah, I went to the ER on Friday. Erica was out of town. His brother, who\u2019s also at Dartmouth, was out of town. They all showed up eventually and yeah, he was having sort of like dis-coordination, un-coordination on his left side. And couldn\u2019t type, couldn\u2019t really walk like properly. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">he was veering towards the left and was feeling fine but everything was a struggle. Like, taking the stairs. And it happened a week before. The same thing. So when it happened again he got himself looked at right away and people were pretty alarmed. Eventually led to an MRI, which led to a very very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200452\">clear diagnosis based on a lesion in his brain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">We saw him yesterday, Jeremy and I. Erica has been there for like, 48 hours, coming off of a red-eye from Baja.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s staying at the hospital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: He\u2019s at Mass General. We actually walked him home yesterday, so he\u2019s home now. So the one lesion is active, so that\u2019s why he was experiencing symptoms. And when a lesion is active, the current standard of care is to take steroids. Like suppressive immune system (inaudible at 00:06:44). The immune <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B1\">cells that are causing the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">So he will be doing outpatient steroids by IV for like another day now. (Pause) It felt so good to be there with them. I haven\u2019t really spent any time in a hospital with a friend. Spent a lot of time in hospitals with family members. It was very different. It was like\u2014we have no sense of contractual <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D1\">obligation. We just like, really really really want to be there. Like not that that\u2019s the overwhelming sense when it\u2019s family, but somehow very different. Very easy to like just sort of be there as if we were in Bryan\u2019s shoes. I think that was maybe what was different. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562308\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">Yeah. (inaudible at 00:09:06) (Pause) And then also on Saturday\u2014ajooba, my grandfather fell. I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve told you about him. He is almost completely blind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Oh. I didn\u2019t know that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: And\u2014this is the one who lives with my parents. He\u2019s 89. He\u2019s going to be 90 in November (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: He has a thriving meditation practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what the state of his meditation practice is. (Chuckles) I certainly don\u2019t know what the state of his guru is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: (Laughs) We\u2019re working [on it though] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah? (Laughs) He\u2019s had five strokes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Wow. I did not know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. He\u2019s the main one that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the hospital with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: And after one of the strokes, he had a month long stay (ph) at a nursing home as part of rehabilitation and then like a day of trying it as a permanent thing and my dad and he\u2014it was like their whole world caved in and they couldn\u2019t handle it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: He nor your dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. He nor my dad. So this story is more about my dad than ajooba. But yeah, there\u2019s a long history. I mean, going back to when my dad\u2019s mom died and then when his brother took his life. My dad has one remaining sister and in that culture it\u2019s your son who you sort of take up as your main <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">place of living if you\u2019re old or if you\u2019re a widow. So he came to live with my parents the day that they got married and has been sort of\u2014he lived like half a year with them for the first like 10 or 15 years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">Yeah. So he took care of us for that time. He would leave in the summers. Well, maybe he\u2019d leave in December. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t like a schedule that made that big of an impression on me. It felt like he was always around and maybe some years he didn\u2019t leave. Yeah, so they have been sort of entangled <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">in a caretaker, like patient kind of way. Or not patient, but person who\u2019s cared for. He was diagnosed with diabetes when he was like 60 maybe? He started losing his vision when he\u2019s 70 so like, since then. So now he can\u2019t really get around too much and he has Margo, who\u2019s this very strong, large woman <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200692\">who has been with my family for 3 years and she lives at our house 5 days a week. Then goes back to Staten Island where her family lives (ph) the other 2 days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">And so then, like nighttime routine is\u2014so she sort of helps him with everything. I think he can wash himself in the shower by himself and he can wipe himself by himself, but he needs help with all the surrounding\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Like getting in and out of the bathroom and stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And my parents obviously take care of him and always on the 2 days that Margo\u2019s not there and then they spent like many months doing it before they found somebody. So Saturday morning at like 6:00 in the morning, he has a commode by his bed and he was going to use the commode and he fell. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">He\u2019s fallen before many times, you can imagine, without eyesight and that many strokes. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562308\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">So he didn\u2019t hurt anything major, which is very lucky. Very hard to imagine not breaking something. He fractured his right ring finger and got some pretty bad lacerations so he was bleeding a lot and needed to get stiches, but that was it. What was disturbing\u2014so my parents sound very very upset. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">are like very seasoned by now, but they sounded very upset. And I think part of that is, there\u2019s so much more where that came from. Like, there\u2019s not too much they can do to improve that transfer from the bed to the commode and there\u2019s not too much they can do to improve things at all. So where there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">a way, my dad will do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">So at 6:00, my parents were still sleeping and most of this has happened at night and he usually will call somebody if he\u2019s having any trouble, but it\u2019s a big issue that he doesn\u2019t, as it is with most people who used to be independent who are now (ph) struggling. So he called out\u2014he has his whistle. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">So my dad has a history of fainting, like me, when he is\u2014it\u2019s sort of like similarly like constellation (ph) and triggers when he\u2019s very sick, when he\u2019s been put under for a surgery and he\u2019s coming out of it and he\u2019s kind of loopy, he\u2019s fainted before. Like when he has a fever is the main thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">But when ajooba (ph) calls in the middle of the night is another trigger. So he has fainted like four times responding to ajooba\u2019s call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: You mentioned three things that \u2013one was coming out of general anesthesia. Another is a fever. And then there was another one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I said the same thing twice. When he\u2019s sick. So not necessarily fever but when\u2014he\u2019s fainted when he\u2019s had like stomach flu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Right. And when he hears his father whistle, that\u2019s another one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: So there\u2019s like maybe not anxiety, and then there\u2019s like anxiety in my reading of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: What do you mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I will elaborate. So it\u2019s like complete circus. My grandfather, the [three of the times] (ph) my grandfather is having a stroke and my mom has to deal with my grandfather and then my dad who\u2019s like on the floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Fainted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Fainted. And like, Margo can\u2019t drive and she doesn\u2019t speak super great English and it\u2019s just like total chaos. There\u2019s a lot of humor around it now because it\u2019s just happened enough times. So my parents have started to deal with this. My mom now will be the one to respond to ajooba. So Saturday <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">morning, she was like, \u201cDon\u2019t get out of bed. I will go.\u201d And he experienced the same symptoms, so it\u2019s not just fainting. And actually, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s actually gone unconscious every one of those times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: He gets light headed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: He gets like drenched with sweat, he goes nauseous, his muscles go limp and yeah, sometimes he faints. So Saturday morning he said that he felt everything coming on and he worked so hard to get through it and not faint and stayed in bed and took like 15 minutes. And meanwhile, who knows what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">happening with ajooba (ph). He didn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: It must be very frightening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s very very frightening. So he called me in the afternoon. He doesn\u2019t usually\u2026 hang on. I\u2019m unable to think of words when I\u2019m lying down. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562308\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">Daylight savings time is really screwing with me this year. I feel very jetlagged. So maybe that\u2019s (inaudible at 00:20:57).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s [what you\u2019re talking about] (ph).I guess I\u2019m thinking like you had just got to the part about him lying there and not knowing what\u2019s going on. Not able to do anything, [feeling pain] (ph), having a hard time and then having to call you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. He called me like after it was all over. But yeah, I am very preoccupied with it. I have been, since he called me.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">So he called and he told me what happened and we talked for a while about it. And he asked for advice, which he\u2019s never done before. You know, \u201cThis thing happens to me, the same thing that\u2019s happened to you. And I tried breathing and sort of like, you know, try to calm myself down and it kind of worked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">this time because I didn\u2019t think that I wanted to know what you\u2014if you would recommend anything for me, based on your own experience?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">That felt like, \u201cYes. I would recommend a lot of things to you and it\u2019s very very big. Feels very big that you\u2019re asking me. So I am, in many more words than this, told him that my experience with my fainting is that, first of all, all but gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">You seem like really really engaged, and it\u2019s making me distracted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: (Pause) Thanks for being so engaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: (Chuckles) Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: It feels very juicy. What happened and what I\u2019m saying.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">So, I can\u2019t really remember the order. I told him that I thought that anxiety played like almost the entire roll in the fainting for me. Like maybe one time \u2013I told him that it was really complicated. It felt really complicated and it\u2019s not clear to me what causes what and what then like feeds back. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">But that I thought it was a manifestation of anxiety for me, and that maybe other people have different manifestations of anxiety and so there\u2019s some combination of like underlying physiological makeup that\u2019s leading me down that same group of symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not manifesting in OCD or insomnia or something [like that] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. Right. Those are much better examples. I was like, \u201cOther people might have\u2026\u201d But I couldn\u2019t really think of anything. Like sweaty palms? But wait. We have sweaty palms when we faint too.  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Are you aware of what kind or reaction you\u2019re having to my [being specially engaged] (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s the same very very sad and very very seductive like split, that I\u2019m telling you something that\u2019s like for once not about me and you. But what\u2019s so over shadowing always is what is about me and you? It\u2019s about whatever I\u2019m telling you about. And it\u2019s very exciting to tell you about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">it, especially because much of what I told my dad was sort of what has come out of here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">So it\u2019s kind of like\u2014it\u2019s exciting and sort of like, I kind of feel like I\u2019m honoring you and the work we\u2019ve done. And telling my dad what I told him and telling you about it. So I feel pretty strong (pause), like clinging to that. Like wanting more of it, like wanting it to last forever, wanting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">draw this out for like [4 sessions] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">And I almost feel a pretty strong\u2014[wait a minute] (ph). (Pause) There\u2019s a lot of sadness. Like it\u2019s going to end soon and I\u2019ll always have something like this to tell you and maybe one reason why it\u2019s so exciting is because maybe I was like you\u2019re affected by what I\u2019m saying and longing so much for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">that. [That\u2019s what I think about] (ph).  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562308\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. My hunch is that I think there\u2019s a kind of feeling of passivity that goes along with the stag (ph) part? And my hunch is that maybe that combination of sadness and worry and passivity, may have related to the fainting?  (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">Like, I think of you having trouble finding words as you\u2019re telling me about it and thinking about something lost. In particular, losing me or losing this, or losing the time to tell me about it. And then I\u2019m obviously thinking also about your dad and his father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: He\u2019s very tender. It\u2019s not just the passivity and the sadness though. There\u2019s something about the energy and the excitement. He\u2019s very anxious. And it didn\u2019t start out that way. It actually felt clear and natural and calm, which I still kind of do. I think it helps to talk about what else is <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">happening as it\u2019s happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">I don\u2019t want to talk about this script (ph) much longer because I really do want to get to talking about them (ph). I told my dad that I thought therapy and meditation were really really important to me and specifically with respect to this manifestation of anxiety and encouraged him to\u2014whatever he <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">wants to call up at that time as a calming practice, we do it every day. So if it\u2019s breathing, whatever it is, so he\u2019s going to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">I also encouraged him to see a therapist or somebody who could talk to him about how he\u2019s feeling about his (inaudible at 00:32:55). He had this very classic\u2014I recognize it myself. I know that I\u2019m very anxious about ajooba. I know that I have a lot of anxieties about not being able to get to him in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">time, not being able to perform, and I\u2019m very very very aware that one of these times might land him in a nursing room and like, I think both he and ajooba are sort of petrified. It\u2019s like this looming thing because he hated it so much. The one day that they\u2014I mean, it was a month, but the one day that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">they sort of made the decision. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">He said, \u201cBut I\u2019m aware of those issues and I talk about them.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOkay. It\u2019s one thing to be aware of them. It\u2019s really really good that you\u2019re aware of them.\u201d I imagine it\u2019s very deep and very bold and that actually that is what\u2019s contributing. And he also had this classic reaction, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">which I also did, which is like, \u201cI\u2019m going to see my doctor and make sure there\u2019s nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d I was like, \u201cDad. You\u2019re 100 percent healthy. He\u2019s not going to find a thing wrong with you and if you need to be reassured of that, that\u2019s great. Go see your doctor.\u201d Hence (ph) Dad had a thought that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF2\">maybe he and ajooba could see someone together. Because ajooba is like 100 times more anxious in terms of his helplessness and fear of losing my parents than I think (inaudible at 00:34:50).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t mentioned it but I guess I\u2019m also imagining his dying, hanging over the\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s almost like if he died today everybody would be happier. I think dying is very scary and bad, but I think being\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Something about the nursing home being more so.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562308\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Being unable to care for your parent is like\u2014being able to care for your parent is the main point of life for my dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. And to have him alive and someway available but be unable to do is what\u2019s so drastic, not sort of losing him altogether. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think there\u2019s a lot of sort of spiritual and just joint acknowledgment and support of death being something that\u2019s going to happen and it sort of feels like there\u2019s a little bit of buffer around that and a way to talk about it. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the same thing around slowly losing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">all your functions. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Well, does sound like if he were to (inaudible at 00:37:18) helpful for them and that would actually make it easier for him to take care of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: I think so<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: And he\u2019d probably do more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: To take care of him? What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Well, if he wasn\u2019t worried about fainting\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. In that moment he would do more. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: [How many] (ph) other things like that, I don\u2019t know, but if he felt less anxious and sturdier, he could probably do more for his dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think there\u2019s a lot to be gained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I guess I also meant\u2014honestly that\u2019s an angle that I\u2019m thinking cynically of our trying to sell it to him, or trying to sell him therapy.

I can\u2019t really say what it is. Like, change something important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Is there something too about the way they\u2019re putting themselves in your hand?

Not just that they\u2019re putting themselves in my hands but that they\u2019re both really self-aware, I think. They both care a lot about themselves. They\u2019re honoring my hard earned sort of wisdom or whatever. Yeah. It\u2019s like who they are and what I\u2019ve done that\u2019s special about it. Not just that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">they\u2019re helping (ph). There\u2019s a lot of acknowledging on my dad\u2019s part that he cares about himself too much to ignore this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s all really great. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel an urgency about it because ajooba\u2019s 89. That\u2019s why I feel worried. It\u2019s also hard to know how to find somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: We have like five minutes.

I\u2019m happy to reconsider this. My thought is that you and I talk a little more about what would be helpful or the kind of person you think would be helpful and then if I can come up with a few names and maybe he can start with one and decide if he wants to shop a little bit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">That seems probably better than my talking to him.

One\u2019s in Providence and one\u2019s in Waltham, and both of them I\u2019ve shared patients with and who I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">have colleagues who know their work quite well and think very highly of them.

Sort of a senior person in the field and I (inaudible at 00:45:34) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201152\">people like that as well. I mean, some of them I think are very good.
