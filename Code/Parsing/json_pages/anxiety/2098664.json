Well, not entirely unexpectedly, I guess. I don't know if I've talked about my landlord and his ripping off part of the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There's a hole in the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yes, just a big exposed chunk. And Ashby has a door from her bedroom to the outdoors, previously (ph) a porch, and that door has no other stripping. So we can just see, you know, like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: And (inaudible at 00:44)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Real cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: It's really cold, though I think it's because the room is small and it can heat up again quickly. So I finally got the city inspector to come out. And she said he needed to fix it but she wasn't sure the stripping on the door but she was trying to get it fixed, the exposed house part. And (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">at 01:18) landlord (inaudible at 01:20) about it. So he decided to stop talking to Ashby and I or communicating to us at all but would tell the people on the first floor what was going on, sort of. So he told them he's doing construction. (inaudible at 01:40) like, waking up and there were just people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">like, tearing at the front of the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, which was really alarming. Also, usually when I sleep I'm in either a (inaudible at 01:59) or just in a t-shirt. So I got up wearing a t-shirt and underwear and I'm like, \"Oh god, there are people.\" And so they're doing this construction next door. And occasionally I've been like, \"Oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">right, I should lower blinds because there are people next door who can in the windows.\" But this was just really (pause), I don't know, like, it was really kind of scary because my landlord Ted is so like, he's super moody and super volatile and had been so angry about us calling the inspector and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">not, like, I didn't know what he was going to do. But part of me thought, \"Well, you know, he's not going to, like what's he going to do? He's just going to, like, yell.\" But that's also scary. Then I was like, \"You know, my landlord and a bunch of other large guys with tools being agitated,\" like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">I just felt I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It wasn't clear that you were unsafe but you felt that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: You might have been but you might not have been unsafe. That was unclear but you feel (ph) Like you were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because [part of the thing] (ph) of what made me feel so unsafe is that he acts so erratically that I feel like there's no real way to say like, \"Oh, no, he wouldn't...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Oh (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. So (pause) but he definitely has some kind of mood disorder because we've seen him, when he was living below, it was just, like, up and down, up and down, up and down. And I know that (inaudible at 04:08) he'll talk about, like, getting (inaudible at 04:12).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Sorry, (inaudible at 04:14) what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Getting into, like, a big yelling fight with someone. And he evicted he had these two guys living with him in the summer and he evicted them via a screaming argument and then putting their stuff on the front porch. They didn't actually have a lease, so but, like, the police showed up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">his eviction was, like, basically their stuff on the front porch and then a scrawled note saying they're trespassing. So yeah. But then other times he's like, \"I love you guys living here. You're so awesome. Never leave.\" So it's always, like, do you hate us? Do you love us? We don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098664\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">They started bringing ladders in the house and, like, I could then, like, see the workmen, like, on ladders, like in the living room windows. I decided that I needed to leave but I also couldn't go out the front door because there was a ladder in front of it. And I opened it and tried to and asked, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">you know, \"Can I come out this door?\" And none of them would say anything. Yeah. Which made me really freaked out. So, you know, I shut and locked it. I didn't have a key to the backdoor. I can only leave it unlocked. So I was really worried. I wanted to leave but then that leaves the back of the house <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F2\">unlocked. But, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 05:53) front door?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I wasn't really sure. Well, part of it was I just didn't think I was, like, safe and that they're pulling shingles down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Right, so they could fall on your head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Right, and there was a ladder blocking the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right, which leaves you to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and there was, like, probably ankle deep in, like, shingle debris. So I was like, well that's just not safe. You shouldn't walk through the construction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: So there was that but I also was worried that, like, Ted would, like, try to get in an argument with me. He's also tried to get in a couple days previous. He'd come up to the door and was like, \"I have to come in. There's been an emergency.\" You know, I can tell if there's an emergency on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">second floor. He's like, \"There's been an accident. (inaudible at 06:48) accident I have to investigate. There's some kind of water emergency.\" Which was really weird and I just said no, you know, there's nothing going on and I wouldn't open the door all the way and I wouldn't let him in. And so that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">also made me nervous because it was such a weird like, there's been an accident. An accident has been reported to me in your apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: OK, yeah. I was going to ask I wasn't sure if you live on the second floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, sorry. I live on the third floor. So he was saying that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 07:24) through your apartment on the third floor, which I guess wouldn't make any sense anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [He asked to view] (ph) your apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was like, \"No, this is my apartment. [You're OK] (ph).\" And also, just the, like, \"It's been reported.\" (inaudible at 07:40) do anything...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: How could anybody else possibly know what's going on in your apartment, except for your roommate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, and the downstairs people were working also. Because at first he was like, \"There's an accident,\" and then he progressed to, \"There's been some kind of water damage or water accident.\" So that also made me worried. So basically, like, I kind of left my apartment really abruptly. Like, threw <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">some stuff in my shoulder bag and (inaudible at 08:14).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, which day is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Wednesday. (pause) Tuesday or Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: But we met...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 08:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 08:36) Monday. I don't know [I did meet] (ph) Wednesday afternoon last week. Like, last week we couldn't reschedule. The week before we (inaudible at 08:46) Friday when you were still sick. And one of those Tuesdays you had to be out but I don't remember if it was this last <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">week or the week before. Yeah, on the Tuesday. I think it was probably last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098664\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so it was Tuesday or Wednesday. It's Thursday. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: [Maybe it's just a fuzzy.

(inaudible at 09:17)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Like a little fuzzy (inaudible at 09:21).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It was when we weren't meeting because I was just, like and then I met with my psychiatrist on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry (inaudible at 09:49) last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I know. It would have been really convenient but I didn't know that. (laughter) Like, I was so freaked out but I also felt weird being, like, (pause) (inaudible at 10:16) because I guess I just didn't well, I do feel unsafe but I don't know if that's reasonable or not, I guess? Because my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">landlord isn't reasonable. He wanted us to give him a key. He gave us a spare key one time and we didn't want to give it back because we were worried he'd just come in, because he has done that repeatedly. (pause) It was just, I don't know. I really felt like I was in a daze for several days. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">I went to physical therapy and then I ended up asking a friend if she could pick me you afterwards and either drive me to my house or go over to her house because I didn't want to have to walk, like I didn't really want to leave my house by myself. I definitely didn't want to return (pause) because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200673\">it just felt really (pause) super uncertain and scary and weird. And I ended up Friday morning having a friend's husband pick me up in the morning. Like, I was going to go downtown. (inaudible at 11:54) pick me up and take me to (inaudible at 11:55) because I wanted to have my landlord know what was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200674\">going on and didn't want to do it by myself. And also, he doesn't take women very seriously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: The landlord?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: My landlord. And that was also very, like my landlord wouldn't let my friend on the porch to ring the doorbell but my landlord rang the doorbell instead or had someone ring the doorbell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Wait, I'm [sort of] (ph) confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: So my friend came up to the house..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: With you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, he was going to pick me up to drive me somewhere. So I'm inside waiting for him to come in a car. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: OK, so you did go back to your apartment on Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, I did at night, like at 5:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: OK.

I just couldn't [stand it] (ph). So I went, like, to the coffee shop for a while. I hung out with a friend for a while. I just, like, didn't want to be in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right, and Wednesday you had actually talked to your landlord, which is [especially why] (ph) your friend's husband pick you up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: No, Friday was when I had him pick me up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, did I say Thursday?

He just sort of turned his back and looked really angry. And I asked, you know, like, [why is this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">happening] (ph)? And he was clearly really angry and said he had no idea how long it was going to take. He had no idea when it was going to be done.

Like, my landlord's behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: OK, you mean you have a hard time accepting your landlord's behaving the way that he was because it's so peculiar?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: And also, I just have a hard time with, like, just kind of everything. Like, his behavior has been so erratic and just so weird. And that he's refusing to talk to me or Ashby is really weird and frustrating. And (inaudible at 16:30) first floor neighbors but not us. And then also, like, being <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">in a position where I don't want to be in my house at all during the day and through, like, early evening. Like, twice he was working after 5:00. And then the other thing is that you know, so Ashby and I have been talking about it and Ashby has been talking to people (inaudible at 17:09) but I ended <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A92\">being the one who called the inspector, had her come, talked to the inspector, dealt with Ted being there. And I just, like, I don't know. Like Thursday I was telling him (ph), like, I just can't do this anymore. I feel so upset and so worried and anxious and freak out. Like, I don't know what to do. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A93\">And (pause), like, due to circumstance, I'm home so it's not like, \"I want you to take a vacation day. Will you take a vacation day?\" Like, I'm just home so it's reasonable but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 18:02) in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: In a way. But I just really hate it and the other problem is because, you know, it's like Ashby and I will talk about something and we'll agree on something and then I try to talk to my landlord and, like, sometimes OK, so this is going to happen and (inaudible at 18:30). And then I talk to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">him and he does something completely different. And so I just end up feeling like whatever I was doing was wrong. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: In a sense like you did the wrong thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, as if I did the wrong thing when I should have done something else. We initially were going to write him a letter and say, like, \"Please don't enter our apartment if we're not here. Here is the key.\" But then I was coming into the apartment and I had gotten the spare key from my friend <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">and he was right there. So I ended up giving it to him right then and there and then Ashby was upset because we had agreed upon writing this letter. And then I was upset that she upset and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098664\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Sorry I'm yawning a little bit.

I mean, it sounds like you're totally freaking out. And, you know, (inaudible at 20:05) in fact, you actually are. Like, however much physical risk there is. Sounds like you feel terribly like you're physically at risk. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">that, you know, he might attack you at any minute or he might barge in on you at any minute. And you're terrified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that's basically I've just been really scared all week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And this was, like there's always (inaudible at 20:47) that sounds bad but that sounds like the part that's kind of the hardest of that, is the, like, ongoing terror that you feel of being at home. And it sounds like it's mostly worry about him physically assaulting you, basically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">out of nowhere at any time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, both physical assault and just, like, getting in my face in yelling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Is Ashby similarly scared?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Sort of. So, like, she's going to work and has something to distract herself with a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Sure, and (inaudible at 21:42) the house all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. She is worried her reaction has been somewhat so she more feels like that our landlord it's more like Ashby's reaction is, like, her feelings are hurt so she feels like she told him, like, \"This is what I need you to do to fix the house,\" and then he ignored what she wanted because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">it didn't matter. So she is taking it more as, like, a personal insult and also her reaction is to want to get revenge somehow. So we withheld December rent until he fixed everything and he still hasn't. But Ashby also said she wanted to withhold a portion of the rent or just not pay it because our <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C52\">apartment, like, we weren't able to have reasonable use of our apartment for two weeks. And I was talking about it. I'm like, I really am worried that he's going to flip out more. (inaudible at 23:18) 150 dollars. So really not that much. And her response is, \"Well, I want to because I'm mad at him <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C53\">and, like, I want to make him...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Right, like she would (inaudible at 23:33) satisfaction from (inaudible at 23:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's basically not (inaudible at 23:39). It's the like, she wants to punish him, [I guess] (ph). And that makes me nervous, like he's going to retaliate. So she's still we talked about it and, you know, she's worried. We're both worried that if he had the key he would come in and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">don't know, whatever. None of us are looking forward to our apartment being empty while we're away for (ph) Christmas stuff. Especially now that he has a key again and can just come in and do whatever. And whatever is sort of like I don't know. He used the first floor's people shower one time after <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C92\">they moved in and their towel. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That's really weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: It is. Because when they said that he (ph) thought they're not allowed to use this (ph) shower, I was like, \"Oh, whatever. How did you know that?\" And the answer was, \"The wife was taking a shower and asked her husband where the big bath towels were.\" He says, \"Oh, I just put one out.\" \"I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">see one.\" And they went into the basement and the towel was there, had been used and was, like I don't know if there's someone taking up residence in the basement also. Like, he has a toothbrush and razor and things down there and some clothes. And there's this big barber chair that he just sits in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD2\">sometimes. So, they found the used bath towel just kind of on his barber chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098664\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 25:14) his stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: [You guys have been there] (ph) a while?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, this is probably I've been there about three years. This will be four years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And you don't have a lease?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, we're definitely moving. Like, we (pause) you know, when he was living below so it was a little easier to deal with his weirdness. And also, he's just gotten stranger. Like, using someone's towel and shower is just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: So, yeah, we don't have a lease anymore. It's just month to month. He can't evict us for six months because we made a complaint to the city and we don't want to stay. Like, it's just (inaudible at 26:09)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: This was, like, February 1st?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Probably like February, March.

I mean, I just yeah, like (pause) one day I was just so jittery, like, I couldn't sit or think so I ended up taking a Valium, which made me less jittery but also makes me feel really, like, (pause) calm but also kind of disconnected from everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Like detached (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yes.

And then today is actually not bad because it's raining and nobody's not working but, I mean, this whole last week and somewhat on Saturday, because I was (inaudible at 27:56) on Saturday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">yeah, I've just been, like, startling and I can't focus or concentrate. Like, I tried. Like, you know, I was like, \"I'll go read a book at a coffee shop.\" Can't concentrate on the book. Went over to a friend's house and hung out but also it was like (pause) I just couldn't focus on anything.

I just feel like I have no idea what's going to happen. And I want to be kind of prepared for anything but you can't. And I feel like there's been a time, like, all day, every day, I need to be careful. I need to be sort of paying attention to what's going on, like, making sure that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201092\">both doors to our apartment are locked. Because sometimes, like, Ashby and I will leave it unlocked for a few hours because we're doing laundry or just going out for a second. So makings you're all those doors are locked. And also, like, how to get in and out of the house when the front of the house <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201093\">is being worked out and both not wanting to be there but also worrying that he'll come in and do something or just, like, come in and work on the apartment, which is creepy. Or, you know, like, will he take a shower? I don't know. Like, that's the thing. So I'm sort of like once taking a shower in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201094\">tenants' apartment and using their bath towels is on the table, it's kind of all on the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Right.

The one thing is that when he was renovating the first floor over the summer he also had to do some things in our apartment.

He can come these days but not these days. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201531\">So there may be a random, like, (inaudible at 39:37).\" Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: I could see if he wants to do get it done quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">THERAPIST: I see.
