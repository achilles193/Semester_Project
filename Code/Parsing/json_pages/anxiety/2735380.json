It\u2019d be helpful to\u2014\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: There is a lot.

And then I actually opened it yesterday, and I was just like, \u201cSo like I have to close this immediately.\u201d (chuckles) So I made an excuse, and I didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an overwhelming list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s extremely long. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d realized he\u2019d written it also about himself. So what\u2019s it like even having sent it to me, and reading it or opening it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: (sighs) I mean, I felt bad sending it to you, because I didn\u2019t expect you to like look it over before our session, but I also didn\u2019t want you to feel\u2014 (sighs) But then I thought, \u201cAt least, you know, if I\u2019m not going to open it and look at it, or I\u2019m not going to print it, I should at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">(chuckles?) get it to you somehow. But I\u2014yeah, it just brought up a ton of anxiety, like even just seeing the topic, like glimpsing the topic. I just closed it immediately. (chuckles) I just like couldn\u2019t\u2014(sigh)\u2014but I\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: So that\u2014even that reaction is really important. There\u2019s a way it kind of shows what you were talking about last time we were here, how much is still frightening about all this. Like it\u2019s a kind of phobic PTSD kind of reaction. That means it\u2019s not been processed yet enough to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: To move past it. So what have you and Ivan talked about with the list lately? I wonder what. You\u2019ve had a lot of discussions on your own and also on couples therapy. I just wonder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So last night, like we had our money meeting. And right after it, that\u2019s when I sent it. And Ivan is like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m getting (ph) this list. [Me and] (ph) Dr. Rosa are actually going to start talking about it.\u201d It\u2019s been hard to. Like I\u2019ve been avoiding talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">it. And actually we had a scheduled conversation last night, and we didn\u2019t talk about it. And I think I purposefully\u2014now (ph) it isn\u2019t, you know, intentionally or consciously, but derailed, you know, away from talking about the list. Because we have talked about it somewhat, but every time we do, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">get stuck. And I get furious. And I get frustrated. And I get confused. And I feel like we\u2019re going down a rabbit hole. Like it\u2019s not\u2014 (sighs?)  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Going down a rabbit hole. Meaning that\u2019s\u2014the conversation kind of evolves in that kind of feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It just doesn\u2019t feel helpful. And it almost feels\u2014and I don\u2019t mean it to sound as accusing as it is\u2014it almost feels like he\u2019s making up answers. Because I\u2019ll ask him about specific things on the list, because some of it is so bizarre kind of. And I\u2019ll ask him about specific things, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">he\u2019ll give me an answer. And like the next time we talk about it, it\u2019ll be a different answer. And I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, so which is it?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d or like\u2014 And I feel like I\u2019m trying to test or trying to get some\u2014 Making sure that he\u2019s not just wiping it away. \u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t about anyone else,\u201d when in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">reality it was a fantasy or it was a something. And he told Dr. Farrow how its, the file\u2019s name is SI for Self Introspection. But and like what the heck is that? (chuckles) (sighs) (pause) And then\u2014sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Oh.

I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my gosh! That\u2019s what that is.\u201d And there was dead silence. And then it wasn\u2019t until last week, when he\u2019s like, \u201cActually it was Life Amongst Regrets.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWait a minute, wouldn\u2019t you have corrected me way back when? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">Or said like, \u2018Oh my gosh! That\u2019s such a horrible\u2014\u2019 like, it wasn\u2019t that?\u201d And that (ph) just seems very, some of it just seems very suspicious to me. And I\u2019m already very suspicious, because I found my husband hiding things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d said to him, \u201cDoes that mean Life After Ramona?\u201d Originally? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t ask him. I just said, \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d And then, like I said what I thought it was. And there was just silence.

(pause) And there was silence. So, yes (ph), technically he didn\u2019t, you know, agree with it or refute it but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but that\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s agreeing. That\u2019s what it means. He doesn\u2019t refute it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It was just\u2014it\u2019s very bizarre. And like until last week, I never heard this other one. But he came up with it immediately. So it wasn\u2019t like in the couple session he thought about it for a while and like came up with a weird excuse. So it was just like very bizarre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s had time in between to think about what else to say it stands for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: He could. Yeah, that\u2019s very possible. And I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very\u2014I guess I\u2019m scared to know. And I\u2019m scared not to know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: This story sounds like it does mean Life After Ramona.

And he like, \u201cThat was just, you know, that was a self-punishing type of thing. I was so sad that I was going to be alone, and that I wasn\u2019t going to have anything.\u201d And I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">sounds as destitute as that if you\u2019re going to get a new job and get a house. And it doesn\u2019t actually sound like \u2018I\u2019m going to go live like in a small apartment and continue to work at Subway forever.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t sound like a depressive\u2014\u201d (clears throat) (sighs) I think part of the reason why I\u2019m so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">anxious about talking about it with Ivan, especially alone, is because I don\u2019t want to be led down\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Lies. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes! And I don\u2019t want to spend time buying into it, and trying to understand, and engaging in potentially just fantasy, and reinforcing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It almost sounds like he\u2019s really not in a place where he\u2019s ready to talk about it in an honest way. The way you\u2019re\u2014I mean, so do you hear that to me it sounds absolutely unambiguous that it means Life After Ramona? Like it doesn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think it meant what he said later.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: It sounds bizarre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Is that hard to hear? You almost want that not to be true or?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Well, of course. If I heard an alternate, of course I\u2019d rather hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It just doesn\u2019t\u2014it fits so well. And the fact that he didn\u2019t deny it, you know? Any person at that moment would say, \u201cOh, no. It didn\u2019t mean that. That\u2019s not what it meant.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: That\u2019s\u2014I sometimes find myself almost\u2014it\u2019s wrong, but I sometimes almost find myself testing him. Like saying, \u201cAre you sure you weren\u2019t looking for someone else?\u201d And then I kind of gauge like his amount of indignation or amount of like being upset about it as whether or not it\u2019s genuine. Sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">I get worried, because it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s as upset about it. (pause) But we\u2019ve also talked about it a few times. It\u2019s not like\u2014I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not really fair, but I\u2019m that I guess desperate to figure out exactly what was going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I mean, even if we assume it did stand for Life After Ramona \u2014and it\u2019s incredibly hurtful\u2014I mean, I just think it\u2019s helpful to begin to sort of, for you to even sort of say to yourself what it is. You know what I mean? And just be in that. And be in that he is probably, it seems, lying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">you about some of these things. That doesn\u2019t have to mean the end of your marriage. Right? I mean, it\u2014 Ivan is incredibly shame-prone. And he is incredibly oriented towards covering something up so as to avoid the shame of the truth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: So we expect\u2014you know that\u2019s his vulnerability. You know that was something that was going to be\u2014like, you know, when I said to you, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be fixed overnight.\u201d And especially around this list. It sort of makes sense that he\u2019s going to try to make some things up a little bit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">I\u2019m not saying that excuses it. I\u2019m just saying, like that actually quite fits the picture with how he functions. This list probably brings more shame to him than anything else. This and the websites. And so there may be moments he\u2019s trying to sort of get around it, or not say something that he\u2019s afraid <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">will be too hurtful or makes him feel too ashamed of himself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Well, but then, even with the Life After Ramona explanation, I think I\u2019m a little scared to pursue that. Because Ivan has been\u2014whenever he was describing it in that context it was, \u201cI was sure you were going to leave me. It was inevitable that you were going to leave me. You were so unhappy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">like I was never good enough,\u201d blah blah blah. And even that feels like an alternative to the like all these websites and the list. Like he was leaving or he was, you know, rejecting me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: This is why I say even if it says\u2014if even if we sort of say it did say Life After Ramona, that\u2019s what it meant\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s sort of exactly more proof that he was about to go have an affair. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I do\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Like people could write\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just really hurtful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s extremely hurtful. I\u2019m not\u2014there are so many reactions you\u2019ll have to it meaning that. But I\u2019m just\u2014it, you know, that was occurring to me. That people could\u2014there could be a total defensive self-protective maneuver to think Life After Ramona, if he\u2019s thinking you\u2019re so fed up with him, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">that he thinks you\u2019re going to leave him any day now. So he\u2019s protecting himself by like planning out his life without you. Do you know what I mean? Again, doesn\u2019t excuse it. Doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have tremendous amounts of feelings about this. But there are so many explanations still for what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200792\">is happening inside him psychically (ph), even though he\u2019s writing Life After Ramona. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">And that\u2019s\u2014I think the more you\u2019re just in probably what really was. And for him, too! The more he can get with Dr. Bourd into, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s good (ph) for Life After Ramona. And why was I writing that? Why?\u201d You know, what was happening? Was it self-protection? Was it aggression? Was it\u2014was he really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">thinking about leaving in some, you know, reality-based way? Even if so, why? You know, was he fed up with feeling criticized, but still loved you? Do you know what I mean? See how that\u2019s really different then like, \u201cUgh! I can\u2019t stand Ramona anymore?\u201d  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Like, yeah, overwhelmed. And now I\u2019m even thinking\u2014like the title of this was like SI. And he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s Self Introspection.\u201d What if it wasn\u2019t Self Introspection? And I don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s just\u2014even if it is, you know like, \u201cOh, she\u2019ll leave me,\u201d he really did make a list, a really, really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">long list. And some of those things\u2014it\u2019s just\u2014like I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t even want to talk about it with him. Because I can\u2019t wrap my head around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">Because some of them are genuine, like very direct criticisms of me. Very direct. Very clear that he\u2019s angry about something. So I can get that. I can wrap my head around that. It seems like a really inappropriate and unproductive way to get it out. It\u2019s not even like he (cries?) sat down in a down <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">in a journal and just said, \u201cI am so angry that she was complaining that it was a really big family thing.\u201d (sniffles) It\u2019s not like that. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">And then there are things on there that are pretty compatible with me. And then there are things on there that are completely like I could never be. I will never be taller. (cries?) I will never be\u2014you know, like just certain things on there. And then I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d That\u2019s the really bizarre <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">like\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: As I\u2019m reading\u2014what\u2019s, so what stood out for you? [Do you think] (ph) there are things that are particularly hurtful, like taller?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like roughly 5\u20193 to 5\u20199, I think he wrote. Which just seems like the most like cutting. Like to honestly look at someone and be like, \u201cYou\u2019re not tall enough.\u201d He\u2019s never complained to me about my height. Never! Not even in a joke. Liked that I was petite. Like just never\u2014and I\u2019m like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d It\u2019s like he\u2014then it feels like he\u2019s like building, you know like a (cries?) like a Barbie. Like a\u2014like these are the features I want. And that\u2019s just so different from saying (sighs), \u201cI wish my spouse didn\u2019t complain about really big family gatherings.\u201d It\u2019s just really, really different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It is really different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s kind of maybe what\u2019s hard to grapple with that (pause) that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s exactly the feeling I had reading the List of a Woman. This is not\u2014he\u2019s not describing a human being. Do you know that? Like there\u2019s no person who fits that bill. No woman. No man. He\u2014it\u2019s a total, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">total idealization. It is as though he\u2019s building a robot, who is perfect at this and perfect at that. And perfect at this and perfect at that. And perfect at this. (pause) There\u2019s not a single human being who will fit that bill on the face of the Earth.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">So already, it feels like it\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s something inside, where he\u2019s struggling with dealing with just humanness. Like people do get annoyed at each other\u2019s families in marriages all the time. (pause) Right? Or people are different heights. Or people have lost their temper or, you know. To be a human <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">means you can\u2019t have the list that [is what he has described] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">It\u2019s so in stark contrast to his list for himself. He\u2019s (ph) really human. He lists his imperfections, right? He puts depression, for example. I\u2019m trying to think of what else. But\u2014he puts a lot of positive things about himself, too\u2014but he put seminary dropout. You know, like it\u2019s actually not a self-idealization. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">He\u2019s putting himself as a human being. [As he\u2019s real] (ph), perhaps a bit needy. (pause) Averse to angry conflicts. (pause) There are ways it feels\u2014the self-introspective side of it feels actually quite accurate in many ways. I don\u2019t know if you had that sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: I guess I felt like a lot of that was accurate.

Like really (cries?) hurtful, obviously. He\u2019s none of\u2014(pause) he\u2019s none of those things. I remember it when I like came across the list. And I just like had it up on my computer. And Emma saw that. She yelled like so many times. She\u2019s like, \u201cHe is none of those things!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: This part is not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just like\u2014so what is that? Woman Looking For? Like how is that self-interested? Like how is that? He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s what I want to be. It\u2019s what I\u2019d like to be. It\u2019s what I\u2014\u201d But why is Woman Looking For? Like why? That makes no sense to me. I don\u2019t understand that. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: The way it\u2019s even getting constructed in other words.

It\u2019s not even like that type of a fantasy. It\u2019s like \u2013it feels very, very disconnected from my existence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And from his existence. I mean, I\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I think, yeah. Maybe pretty unrealistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a real kind of fantasy bubble that\u2019s really removed from reality in so many different ways. That part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: (sighs) When I first confronted him about the height thing, he said\u2014he\u2019s like, \u201cBecause if I was ever alone again,\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want someone that ever reminded me of you.\u201d And that (sighs?) feels hurtful. And then a while ago, I asked him about it again. I\u2019m like, \u201cI cannot wrap my <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">around this. I do not understand. I\u2019ve never heard you complain about my height.\u201d (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: And he said\u2014he\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m a pig.\u201d And I said, \u201cOK.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cBecause I wish that when we hugged like your face was closer to mine.\u201d And I said\u2014 (cries?) I was like, \u201cSo what is that? So it\u2019s about me. It\u2019s not about me. Which is it?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s both.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">I\u2019m like, \u201cHow is it both?\u201d (sighs) And I told him I thought he was piggish for making a list like that, which didn\u2019t help. But I\u2019m furious. And it doesn\u2019t make it okay to say something like that, but I\u2019m just unbelievably furious like that it exists. And then it just feels like we can\u2019t talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB2\">it, because he\u2019s, I feel like almost inevitably, defending it. And that inevitably is like more hurtful to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It is not.

But he\u2019s otherwise so far away from what his real intentions are, it sounds like. So it\u2019s hard. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD1\">can\u2019t talk about it.

And it\u2019s not like he wrote, \u201cI wish she was taller. I wish we could, you know, I wish her face was next to mine when we hugged.\u201d He didn\u2019t write that. Roughly 5\u20193 to 5\u20199. It was like as if\u2014it would be like if I wrote an ideal weight for him. (cries?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s\u2014so another reaction I had to it, Ramona \u2014and I know this is maybe hard to hear, but it felt incredibly demeaning. Not just to you, but kind of\u2014it\u2019s a real objectification of a woman period. Do you know what I mean? It does feel like he\u2019s kind of sadistically constructing a perfect <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">Barbie doll.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Woman Looking For clearly is\u2014I mean, he\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know how he jumps from like the list that\u2019s mostly realistic, but he leaves out a lot of things. He jumps from that to like Woman Looking For, completely unrealistic, completely like boy he would have to be some kind of (chuckles) top surgeon <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">model to fit that list. And then like 75 things that\u2014and I, I\u2019m really really angry. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I know what he felt about me being critical and I feel like I\u2019ve worked on it a ton as a result. Not just because of his feelings, but because I needed to as a person. But then on top of it, I really felt like, you know, I\u2019m pretty responsible. I actually, I don\u2019t know that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">I call myself smart, but I finished grad school and did well. And (gasps) I have a full-time job.

And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what it\u2014if it\u2019s like coming from his own self-criticism, but I just feel like I\u2019ve at least held down and make like\u2014(sighs) I\u2019ve been able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">function a lot more than he has for the majority of our marriage.

You guys need to talk about this in couples.\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing three different people, and I still can\u2019t figure out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E92\">what the heck is going on?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">I just like (sighs), \u201cHow can you do? How does this never weigh on your mind?\u201d Especially for someone who\u2019s so prone to guilt and shame and anger. Like how can it not weigh? Like if I did something like that it would torture me. And I would have to come clean! He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I did think about these <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">things every day. Just like with seminary.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cEvery day it like played on my mind.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cReally? Because wouldn\u2019t that get to be unbearable very quickly?\u201d (sighs) It feels so disrespectful. It\u2019s not like just that he screwed up. It\u2019s like then not even enough respect to come clean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: [He hid that] (ph) for a long time in both instances. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: (sighs) He said\u2014on the list he has like someone who wants children. And I told him I thought that that was incredibly particularly cruel. Because that\u2019s more than I\u2019m unhappy with my wife. That\u2019s more than I could be attracted to someone who was like this instead. That\u2019s like I want a whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">life, and a whole family, and a whole\u2014and that\u2019s like a whole different level. And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. Every time I read the list, I would stop at that one and just cry, because you\u2019re the only one I want to have children with.\u201d And I was like, \u201cReally?\u201d Then like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s feeding you lines because he doesn\u2019t know what to say right now about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: (sighs) So what is that? Like was he thinking about like an ideal woman and that\u2019s part of it? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: So one on the things I wonder about the sequence of it. Starting with this list of it\u2014again, leaves out a lot of things, you\u2019re right and maybe a number of these things actually do have elements of idealizing himself still. Right? Just for the record, I don\u2019t mean this is a perfectly (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">00:25:42) at all, as much as I was only trying to say there he is at least\u2014it\u2019s not a Ken doll he\u2019s describing in himself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: So he is\u2014there\u2019s some degree of like pointing out his flaws as a person that happens in the first list. Then he moves to Woman Looking For. So what I start to wonder if there\u2019s a way this is a massive defense against his own feelings of inadequacy. That he feels like he is not an adequate <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD1\">partner for you. He\u2019s not a provider. He\u2019s not a defender. He\u2019s not stable. He\u2019s not aspiring. You know? Like there\u2014these actually are things you\u2019ve articulated that you would like in a partner. Right? I mean, even just having aspirations, responsible, clean. Right? So in a way, it\u2019s a description of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD2\">the things that you\u2019re looking for that he feels he\u2019s not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">So it starts to make me wonder is like has\u2014was he drowning in so much of this sense of inadequacy, in your eyes? Whether that\u2019s what you felt or not, what he was doing with your criticism really (ph) not, or what he\u2019s doing with your really appropriate judgments of the things he was not doing well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF1\">Do you know what I mean? Was feeling like, \u201cI\u2019m such a horrible human being that I don\u2019t like\u2014I\u2019m nowhere near what Ramona wants.\u201d Right? And that he then goes on this kind of self-protective attack of saying, \u201cWell, here\u2019s my ideal woman.\u201d Right? Like, \u201cI\u2019m going to describe now a perfect Barbie,\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF2\">as a way of protecting himself from his own inadequacy. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">Again, none of this excuses it, Ramona. I think this list is incredibly actually bizarre. It\u2019s a very strange thing to have done. It\u2019s very atypical. Even when people go and have affairs, they don\u2019t make a list like this. And extremely hurtful and cruel. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">And yet, I think there are ways. The explanation that makes the most sense is that he was being\u2014going on the attack to protect his own sense of inadequacy. That is narcissistic. That\u2019s actually what people who are narcissistic do, for example. Like deep down, you feel so like your own worthless piece <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">of shit, for example, so you devalue, demean, pick apart other people, because you feel like inside that\u2019s in some ways unconsciously what you\u2019re doing to yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: Like he can only feel better about himself if he\u2014if other people are less or inferior?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">THERAPIST: At least in this bubble, that\u2019s like the only way of protecting what he\u2019s\u2014his own like really deteriorated self-esteem at this point\u2014is to build up and say, \u201cWell, this is the perfect image I want.\u201d I don\u2019t think he always is doing that with you. I don\u2019t like\u2014in other words, I wouldn\u2019t say <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201071\">he has narcissistic personality disorder in a formal kind of way, where there are people who go about the world all the time putting and demeaning other people down. That\u2019s not the way Ivan is in his character.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">But in this bubble, there\u2019s a way it feels like he\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s his desperate effort to protect his self-esteem. And it\u2019s really primitive. I mean, that\u2019s what I think when I say it\u2019s bizarre. It\u2019s kind of an indication of how degraded his own sense of himself is, or how kind of convoluted and complex it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201091\">is, that he\u2019d have to go through this. And that I think in some ways, Ramona, is more what is hard to grapple with, the bizarreness of it. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t wrap my\u2014I just like I can\u2019t. Can\u2019t get an explanation that seems helpful or adequate. And I feel like I can\u2019t just certain pieces on that go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: (pause) I think it makes sense like that you can\u2019t get an explanation. I think one of the reasons it\u2019s hard for three people even on your treatment team to explain it is that it\u2019s pretty strange. You know, there\u2019s a lot of\u2014it feels like sort of sadism, and cruelty, and defensiveness, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D1\">attack, and belittling, and demeaning that is otherwise not where Ivan lives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">Like I start to imagine, you know, how little he\u2019s able to confront. Imagine this as a kind of all of a sudden he finally let out all of his rage, that he\u2019s got to have for a lifetime of even being mad at his parents. Like I think half of this is\u2014has nothing to do with you. Most of it has nothing to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F1\">do with you. But holds inside it like this one space where he was able to let out the angry feelings that he\u2019s stuffed under the rug his entire lifetime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">THERAPIST: That doesn\u2019t mean you have to be okay with it, Ramona. Like this, you know, it makes sense that this would be profoundly hurtful and hard to get over. That it\u2019s really hard to wrap your mind around every piece of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20112-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20112-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: But I do think it makes sense that it\u2019s a kind of bubble of rageful (ph) feelings that came out.

Direct confronting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201171\">Confront his parents. Assert himself more.

And I feel\u2014(sighs)\u2014I feel so much anger, but I feel especially angry because while we\u2019re spending so many sessions talking exhaustively about ways that I can be less critical, words that I shouldn\u2019t use. Like (sighs) just flat out ignoring certain things that don\u2019t happen and not <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D1\">saying a word about it. Like getting to, really kind of getting to the extreme where like things work if I shut up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">And meanwhile Ivan is so much more critical in such an underground like way. I\u2019ve never said\u2014like as much as I\u2019ve gotten angry about things, I\u2019ve never sat down and picked him apart by 75 like characteristics and just like while I\u2019m at it I\u2019d also like it if he was, you know\u2014 Like, that\u2019s what makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F1\">me\u2014 (sighs) It just feels like he and his parents sometimes have just been like I\u2019m so critical, and I\u2019m so judgmental, and anything to avoid reality. But then he\u2019s able to do this. And it\u2019s so much more. (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: Again, because it\u2019s so not what he does anywhere else in his life, it\u2019s like\u2014I don\u2019t know how to describe this\u2014like, you know, imagine, kids need to help their aggressions get shaped and worked into being effective in society. It\u2019s like this part of him that is so unintegrated that it is <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201211\">very volatile, rageful, cruel, destructive. And it exists kind of in a bubble inside. And I think probably there are ways it still does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">Like it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s worked through this enough to say, \u201cYeah, this is this bubble of rage. And I\u2019m so sorry it came out at you. It\u2019s meant for other people. And I was having a hard time asserting myself in the relationship. And this is the only way it came out, to protect myself. I couldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201231\">talk to you, for example, to your face about\u2014\u201d Not these things on the list, but I think if you were to be able to talk about the normal things that were bothering him in the relationship, and coming and say, \u201cOh, well, here\u2019s what I want to work on,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m upset with Ramona for this,\u201d in the couples <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201232\">therapy session, he wouldn\u2019t need\u2014there\u2019s no need for going in to like sort of back channels for this kind of thing to have happened.

At least it would have been direct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">And it\u2019s worse because he never came clean and showed me this. I found it. And as much as I like (sighs) don\u2019t want to violate privacy, I\u2019m so grateful. I\u2019m absolutely, like I\u2019m unbelievably infinitely grateful that I did, because what if he had never told me? What if it had continued?

I just don\u2019t understand how. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Because he was incapable. And I think this is what\u2014I don\u2019t know that he is capable, yet, of doing that in his own development. Bringing it into your, the room, and to your face. Do you know what I mean? Like that actually requires a level of mature assertiveness that he\u2014 In front of you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F1\">in front of Dr. Farrow, maybe even in front of Dr. Bourd it\u2019s only, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault.

But part of me is so scared to, I think honestly, like trust someone outside of you to have like an objective (sigh) or to be able to say like, \u201cThese are maybe cop out excuses.\u201d Or\u2014I just\u2014and I don\u2019t want to engage and spend time investing in <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201372\">and encouraging Ivan to buy into those types of things if they\u2019re completely not true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20139\">THERAPIST: We had a brief exchange, Dr. Farrow, Dr. Bourd, and I, about this question of you\u2019re going in. And (pause) I after the fact ended up having a little, some hesitation. I think Dr. Bourd has some hesitations. Just really wanting to make sure it\u2019s going to be helpful to the both of you to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201391\">that. And one of the concerns is that what he might say to you, if\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2013B\">CLIENT: Who?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Dr. Bourd. If you had a private conversation, and he were to tell you what he really thought, would, might be different than what he would say in front of Ivan at this stage in their relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2013F\">CLIENT: Why is that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20141\">THERAPIST: In other words, there may be times that\u2014 (pause) If he\u2019s working right now with Ivan\u2019s defensiveness around it, sometimes you\u2019re not going to immediately confront the defense, and say like, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about this. You\u2019re making up lies.\u201d Right? I\u2019m not saying\u2014I\u2019m reading beyond what he <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201411\">said. Because I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know his full opinion about all this. But I do know that he said,\u2014to be honest with you, this is sort of almost a direct quote\u2014\u201dI have a hard time buying into what he says all the time.\u201d He says when he\u2019s in the room, and he\u2019s explaining it, it sounds convincing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201412\">But when you think about it sort of out of the heat of the moment, it still doesn\u2019t add up and doesn\u2019t make sense. So I am saying that to you because the side of what I think you might want to accomplish going in there is just hearing more of Dr. Bourd opinion. And that\u2019s kind of his two cents at this <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201413\">point. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20143\">If I said to you\u2014for example, let\u2019s say I didn\u2019t believe something you were saying\u2014but if I just said to you, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d you might never come back again. So he [maybe put and partly] (ph) sort of pacing himself with how to constructively, slowly, over time challenge some of the defenses. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201431\">Like people\u2019s defenses exist for a reason. If I were to say the minute, the first day I meet someone, \u201cYou\u2019re defending yourself in this XYZ,\u201d like people\u2014it\u2019s not palatable. So he may\u2014they may be at a place where it\u2019s just slow going to get to that point. He\u2019s not directly confronting some of it. Again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201432\">I\u2019m extrapolating a little bit. And I wouldn\u2019t want him to sort of, to you get the impression that he thinks everything\u2019s fine, just because he\u2019s not directly confronting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20142-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20142-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20145\">CLIENT: OK. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20147\">THERAPIST: That said, maybe this will force Dr. Bourd to actually confront some of it in a way, because you\u2019re both in the room. You know, I don\u2019t know. There could be upside (ph). But I just know he wanted to be thoughtful with Ivan about kind of pros and cons. And (pause) likewise I want to sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201471\">check in with you about what you hope it will do, what it might not do even though you hope it\u2019ll do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20149\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m looking for (pause) essentially you to like\u2014 This doesn\u2019t make sense. But when you\u2019re able to look at the list, and you\u2019re able to say like, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d I really appreciate that and value that. And I feel like it\u2019s objective. You have no like personal agenda in (gasps?), <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201491\">you know, defending Ivan or defending me. And I guess I\u2019m looking for someone to do that with Ivan and me. Because I feel like until that happens, he\u2019s able to keep\u2014we\u2019re going to keep going down this rabbit hole of, \u201cIt\u2019s this. Oh, wait, it was this. Oh, it was kind of both. Oh\u2014\u201d And that\u2019s not helping. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201492\">It\u2019s actually more hurtful. But I don\u2019t know how to, how to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) So maybe I can encourage\u2014I don\u2019t know if Dr. Bourd has read the list directly. Do you know if he has?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2014D\">CLIENT: So, Ivan said that he had like put it onto his phone and read it to Dr. Bourd at some point. But I don\u2019t know exactly how accurate\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Read the whole thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20151\">CLIENT: That is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20153\">THERAPIST: That would take up ten minutes of a session just reading it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20155\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how accurate that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, I can ask him has he seen the list (chuckles) or did he hear the list. It sounds like Dr. Farrow definitely has not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20159\">CLIENT: Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015B\">THERAPIST: And I can encourage both of them to take a look because\u2014 And say\u2014you know, this is again, I\u2019m in some ways in your corner here,\u2014but that you\u2019re feeling like he\u2019s\u2014 There\u2019s an accountability that is not happening until that happens in a way that feels like you\u2019re really getting at what this <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2015B1\">was, so you know what you\u2019re working with, that you can\u2019t move forward past this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015D\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2015F\">THERAPIST: How would that feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20161\">CLIENT: I think that would help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20163\">THERAPIST: What I don\u2019t know still is where the best place like if\u2014certainly with Dr. Farrow I think it\u2019s really appropriate. And I think she\u2019ll hear from me that I, you know, that you\u2019re feeling like he needs to be held more accountable. (pause) I don\u2019t know whether Dr. Bourd and Ivan will decide on, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201631\">in their relationship is it helpful and healthy enough to have you in. Would you be open to it if they decide yes? Does that\u2014like how do you feel about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20165\">CLIENT: I\u2019m a little scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20167\">THERAPIST: [Oh, that would\u2014] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20169\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s not\u2014how do I put this? When you\u2014when we separated, when Ivan lived somewhere else for three months\u2014and you said you need to stop talking with Dr. Bourd at all, like that was just like\u2014 I always worried, and I still worry that like he knew about the websites. He knew. Like maybe he knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201691\">about the list and never said anything. And I know that that\u2019s his job\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2735380\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2016B\">THERAPIST: He didn\u2019t!

(chuckles?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2016D\">CLIENT: But then I also wonder like did Ivan really have an affair and Dr. Bourd knew about it the whole time, but he\u2014 You know, he\u2019s doing his job. Like he\u2019s not allowed to say anything, but also like oh we separated, and then things never\u2014you never just like started talking again or like, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2016D1\">(sighs) He has figured out a lot, but he\u2019s able to let it on because he would\u2014but you know, Ivan wouldn\u2019t continue to confide in him. I worry about that. So I guess I essentially don\u2019t trust him a lot. And it\u2019s\u2014I understand that that\u2019s his job, but it feels frustrating, someone trying to figure out <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2016D2\">what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Just so you know, at least what I know about that, there are things you were telling me that Dr. Bourd didn\u2019t know yet.
