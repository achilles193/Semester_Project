I woke up and took him from her around 8. She went back to sleep and she came back in some distress saying she had had a dream of my father and his lover. So this February is the 17th anniversary of his death. So that\u2019s a very durable trauma that was basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">going on in the late \u201870s. So that was one errant thought that I had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Another thought was that I had been very protective when people have tried to say that I need to help Jennie. I do, I feel like we help each other a lot. But people are kind of casting me in a role of house husband or when it feels like they\u2019re casting me in a role of house husband, facilitating <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">her professional endeavors. So my mother did something like that last night and it was sort of setting her off. Um, what else? Slowly, slowly, after five months, really five months after I\u2019d left this not entirely satisfying professional situation aside, or what was left of it, finally beginning to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">think about how to set up this project, this novel. I don\u2019t know how systematically, how productively, but spending two to three hours at a time on it. So that process, I think, has left me feeling a little bit at cross purposes from this narrative exercise, maybe. Or \u2013 that\u2019s not quite right. Optimally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">they have to be compatible, but for some reason the process of \u2013 yeah, maybe more precisely, this state of mind that is described by my trying to do this, which is pretty anxious still right now, and not very organic, is not very conducive to our reflection. I\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Jeffreyed (sp?) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">or just something, something, something that\u2019s not reflective, something that\u2019s not \u2013 if I was writing it would be a different story but it\u2019s like trying to imagine the setup, arrange my head so that I can write and that\u2019s something else again. It\u2019s kind of alienating from myself I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">What else comes to my head? I mentioned this the last time we spoke. You may want to run with any of these I suppose. There is this interesting dichotomy between the very relaxed and calm and placid, relaxing state of mind that gets Grayson to sleep and difficulties I have myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">(Pause): [0:08:50 0:08:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I assume that when I put him asleep it\u2019s part of because I\u2019m projecting some very relaxing vibes. Even when I\u2019m upset I seem to be able to, usually. He\u2019s going through a major spurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause): [0:09:30 0:09:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really quite something. Anyway, so. I guess my last thought was, \u2018damn it, we were \u2013 we had a thread of conversation, it seemed, I was fruitful last week and it\u2019s completely gone out of my head. My final thought was I\u2019ve got a lot of (unclear) at this point. Just to be comprehensive. [0:10:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Right. That makes everything clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: That makes everything clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(Pause): [0:10:30 0:11:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: So the way that I\u2019m thinking about a bunch of that \u2013 I admit, I can\u2019t fit the (unclear) in, because that\u2019s what makes it (unclear), is more seriously, I think some of what you\u2019re talking about has to do with like people being there for each other when they need them. I\u2019m thinking of, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">know your mother, my fantasy actually was \u2013 and I have no idea (unclear) like if your dad\u2019s affair was in the late \u201870s, you were born in the early \u201870s and your sister was born in the mid-\u201970s, there must have been a time when she felt like he just wasn\u2019t really there for her and I don\u2019t know if it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">was being up all night with the baby or something that reminded her of something from that time, but whatever, the point is she remembered like a (unclear) betrayal. And then you describe being sensitive around people sort of pushing you to be there for Jennie, if I understood you right as though you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200333\">weren\u2019t, or as though you wouldn\u2019t be, although you are in a lot of ways, you know? [0:11:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562002\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">And also, and somehow she\u2019s not there or not going to be there for you, which happily, as I understand it, she often is. And then you mention about the writing and I think in a way like trying to get \u2013 I don\u2019t understand it that well, but kind of like faith of your own to be able to write. And there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">something about that that feels like it\u2019s making you less reflective or less communicative or something about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Okay. There may or may not have been a segue there. Like, I\u2019m not sure the relationship you were drawing between the two thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not making any \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: You\u2019re just kind of listing things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019m listing things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(Pause): [0:14:39 0:14:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Because the next thought was, one of the next thoughts was about \u2013 there were a couple of them \u2013 remembering that we had talked about something fruitful last week and had a (unclear) conversation that you kind of remembered at that moment was fruitful but couldn\u2019t then remember it all and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">were kind of frustrated. And (Pause) there\u2019s something going on. I mean the thing about that last part that sort of relates to the writing somehow, the thought it gave me about not being able to remember was I think there are clearly a lot less now than used to be the case, but I think there\u2019s a way <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">that I\u2019m kind of gone from you between sessions sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Which seems to be more true. But I think that like often we talk, or have talked about your forgetting threads or having sometimes no connections about what we talked about before. And this time it struck me like I guess part of that is that I\u2019m gone for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think that is exactly the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Like it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t even know what it would mean. I mean, yeah, it makes some sense, obviously. Yeah. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s hard not to understand the absence of somebody meaning that they\u2019re gone. If you mean that I don\u2019t think about our interactions in between the times that we\u2019re talking to each <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">other. Yeah, how does it usually go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it. I have the sense that it\u2019s otherwise with Jennie. That you know, when you\u2019re doing stuff around the house or with Grayson, if she\u2019s off teaching or sleeping or doing something else, it\u2019s like there\u2019s very much the sense of being like not just an idea but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">a feeling of being in this together, of her sort of being there with you and for you and vice versa.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562002\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: We text during the course of the day, saying, \u2018how\u2019s class going?\u2019 Etc., etc. Tangible communications that don\u2019t obtain when you\u2019re not in an intimate relationship with somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Right, right. Sure. But I imagine even between those like you have some sense of her being with you in what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Well, when I\u2019m upset I have anxieties about this and it\u2019s hard for me sometimes to connect with it. I feel a little worried about the state of our connection. Even with Jennie. I\u2019ve said this. We\u2019ve talked about this. So, no. Maybe \u2013 I mean, in the sense that you\u2019re using it, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: As I understand it, at least. Maybe it\u2019s not true that even with Jennie I have this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: My hunch is that it\u2019s sometimes there and sometimes less so when you\u2019re feeling anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But when you\u2019re not it\u2019s less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes. You know what I\u2019m feeling when things are flowing and feels better. I mean, I remember, I basically remember what we talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Now that we\u2019re kind of settled into the conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: You know, things are flowing. I could probably, if we spent five minutes, call it back to mind. But there\u2019s a feeling of not being able to. A feeling of disconnection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s partly, it\u2019s hard to tease out what exactly, but I wonder if it\u2019s partly your having something to say, my responding to it, and like as you say, our kind of getting into the flow of the conversation where it\u2019s going to like, \u2018I\u2019m back and our project is back.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I see what you\u2019re saying. Yeah. Sure. Is this my peculiar, I don\u2019t have much of a baseline for this. Is this my peculiar malady or is this a neurosis that is unusual or do most people who have psychotherapy struggle with fitting individual conversations together between sessions? I would imagine, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">it just seems like kind of a structural feature of this peculiar mode of whatever you want to call it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Well, you know, it varies and when it\u2019s more or less difficult and what is more or less difficult to remember often I think are significant. You\u2019re on the more forgetting and feeling disconnected feeling and oftentimes \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: This is true. I endorse your proposition. I think it\u2019s neither kind of a novelty in our discussion nor should be surprising given the sort of global analysis which is it has something to do \u2013 you know, whatever. It\u2019s just kind of on the attachment end of the spectrum. So sure. Naturally, I find <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">it challenging, or more challenging than I might to feel attached to people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">(Pause): [0:21:23 0:21:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: So I guess I\u2019m interested in how that relates to your trying to work on the novel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Oh, good question. Yeah. Finish your thought because I think I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Both in terms of in the sense of who are you trying to have or not have in the room while you\u2019re doing that and in terms of like, in a way, one of the things you seem to be saying to me was, \u2018actually, Marshall, you\u2019re not really in the room when I\u2019m working on that because there\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">about pulling myself together to do that that makes me feel like it\u2019s harder to do this.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562002\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: I guess what was sort of disorienting or, I don\u2019t know quite how to put it, disequilibrating about the three and a half hours that immediately preceded this conversation was how difficult it was, it wasn\u2019t the process of working on the novel as I imagine it in a really productive mode, it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">the very things that make it not such a productive process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Right. (Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: The difficulty working on the novel was interfering with our connection. It was, rather than some intrinsic property of it, I think I have a decent enough recall of what it\u2019s like to really be writing well but you know I kind of remember there are kind of different things going on and kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">intervening with psychotherapy but the mood is very different. The kind of affective interference is very different. When I\u2019m writing well and when I\u2019m feeling good about it I\u2019m able to jump into a conversation. I just may be diverted in a direction that does not \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it didn\u2019t seem to me like oh I\u2019m just kind of preoccupied thinking about this right now. I\u2019m sort of off and running with it. Yeah, that\u2019s not what it was. No, it was troubling. There was something very troubling that was going on. There are some things about that process that worry <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">me, for example, instead of writing kind of going through old projects to find bits and pieces that I might want to include, which isn\u2019t intrinsically bad, but it is insofar as there\u2019s a tendency to just want to include everything. I just want it to be a pastiche of and (unclear) of everything that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200812\">I\u2019ve been working on the last 15 years or so and every part of myself that it represents. And kind of a mechanism to kind of piece together the scattered layers of my consciousness and you know, I suppose any writing process at some level, especially given the circumstances is something in that direction. [0:25:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">But I don\u2019t know. I felt like I was rehearsing all of these psychic hobby horses in a way that was not very healthy or productive. On the other hand, I\u2019ve just got a lot of material and figuring out how it all fits together is part of this project. I think there was something about the way in which <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">I\u2019m finally, at long last trying to prepare for this that was \u2013 I struggle for a word and I come up with jargon, to my dismay \u2013 but I just kind of, it led to a kind of dysphoria or a kind of suppression or depression of the mood. I\u2019m not quite sure how else to put it. And maybe we can make that more <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">specific and less abstract. But there was something curious, something weird, something kind of upsetting about the process. And one of the things that may have been upsetting about it was the way in which there was this layer of consciousness saying, \u2018you\u2019re never going to do this. Nothing is ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200833\">going to come of this.\u2019 What\u2019s going to come of this is \u2013 you know, I guess this is some kind of classic thing one has to get over with. Right? But that was a very strong, kind of sub-verbal narrative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">(Pause): [0:27:39 0:27:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: And by that same token I really want it not to be true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: And I couldn\u2019t quite convince myself by the time I was here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re feeling a bit defeated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Feeling the possibility of defeat. I have evaded the kinds of structures that make defeat unambiguous for the moment but feeling defeat as a possibility. You know, I\u2019m five months into this experiment and granted, I\u2019m three months into the experiment of being a father \u2013 at some level it\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">of stupid to think about it this way and yet, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562002\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s very interesting, maybe. It\u2019s as though there\u2019s a part of you that has the idea that you should have been off working on this for the last five months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Yes. That is a very bizarre idea but it is indeed the idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">(Pause): [0:29:17 0:30:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: That seems connected to, or a bit mixed up with the feeling of defeat being possibly in there. I hear you saying there\u2019s often a struggle with writing but I guess what I\u2019m thinking of is there\u2019s a part of you that is worried you\u2019re not going to get anywhere, is connected to the thought that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">you really haven\u2019t gotten anywhere in five months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: I guess so. It is connected. I mean the five months is so obviously distorted. I don\u2019t know how seriously to take it but except as part of some free floating anxiety of some kind, in other words, you know, come on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">(Pause): [0:31:07 0:31:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I agree that it\u2019s sort of very unrealistic but I mean \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">(Pause): [0:31:20 0:31:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t (Pause) \u2013 usually thoughts that seem very true and yet not at all realistic are interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Does this seem very true? Very true to what I\u2019m saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You said, yeah, no, it doesn\u2019t make any \u2013 you said \u201cbizarre\u201d but yeah, I actually do kind of think that. I know it\u2019s not realistic. I mean you\u2019re not saying, \u2018yeah, really, I thought I should have been working on this three months ago when Grayson was born.\u2019 Of course not. Nor four months <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">ago when you \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s true that I\u2019m saying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But you\u2019re saying there\u2019s some part of you that puts stock in it, that recognizes that part of you isn\u2019t being realistic and yet \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: I just feel like I should be working on something. Maybe that\u2019s more to the point. I feel I should have worked and since this is the work I\u2019ve given myself, you know, and has secured at least temporary consensus within my household, that it will be my work. I should be working on it and I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">be making progress on it. And yet, progress has been limited and therefore I feel defeat. So maybe there is a kind of contemporary rather than future sense of defeat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Right. Again, to me, sort of equally striking in that actually you have done quite a lot of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Have I? Oh, in regard to Grayson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Grayson and sort of both pre and post-natally, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Alright. Sure. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: And somehow that doesn\u2019t \u2013 I know when you step back from it, of course it counts, but from the point of view of the part of you that feels like you should be working on this \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s kind of scary though, that work, identifying that as work because I guess this relates to the stuff about being leery of people telling me I should do more for Jennie. I don\u2019t want to become a mommy. I don\u2019t want to become a housewife, house husband. I don\u2019t want to be the sole caregiver. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">I don\u2019t want that to be the rest of my life. I\u2019m not satisfied with that and when I say to myself, \u2018you know, well I\u2019ve been doing this work and this is my work and this is what I\u2019ve got done \u2013 rather than identifying the work that I identify with rather than specify the work that I identify with as <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB2\">these other projects as I would like to do. It seems as if I\u2019, inexorably being maneuvered into a position where I\u2019m just an economically non-enumerated mommy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562002\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">(Pause): [0:35:07 0:35:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">(Pause): [0:31:14 0:35:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: So either I can figure out how to do this at long last or that is what I will be with significant consequences for our household resources and everything else as well as my own sort of self-image satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: And I think you\u2019re actually quite panicked about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I am. I\u2019m very worried about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s why the part of you that\u2019s panicking is thinking things like, \u2018I\u2019m five months behind.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Very true. Very, very, very, very on point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">(Pause): [0:36:06 0:36:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And yet \u2013 am I interrupting a train of thought?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: No. No. And yet the way of averting this would have been just to apply for a bunch of jobs. I mean it would have been fairly easy to avert this and I have not done so. So there\u2019s something extremely curious about this state of affairs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Maybe this fits in very cleanly with a bunch of the stuff we\u2019ve been talking about in that (Pause) you know, I think at one level being with Grayson and Jennie and doing stuff sort of for the family feels like being a team player, doing what\u2019s best for sort of the group of you and you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">worried about losing something that at that level feels like it is for you and very important to you. Now we both know that in reality if you\u2019re off making money, obviously that helps the family. I get that. And if you\u2019re going to (unclear) that, it\u2019s going to be back into the family in a good way. [0:38:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">But I think maybe there\u2019s a way that feels like going off and doing your own thing, or leaving the family in some fashion and I wonder if that\u2019s part of why I haven\u2019t done it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">(Pause): [0:38:28 0:38:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I know that I am conscious of an interpretation of my father\u2019s various infidelities on various levels that is kind of consonant with the way you just put it \u2013 necessary generational adjustments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: So that doing professional stuff is a betrayal at some level of the family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess what I had in mind in terms of the work situation that we talked about was that kind of what it feels like I think when she\u2019s going to leave or when people get ambitious and stop looking out for you. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: And I guess, you know, maybe at some level that\u2019s how I interpret \u2013 I am very good-heartedly and sincerely supportive of Jennie\u2019s professional endeavors. I don\u2019t feel any conflict about that but I clearly, at some level I do feel anxious about my obligation to support that to the extent that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">perhaps I feel as if there\u2019s a risk of betrayal there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You\u2019re vulnerable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m vulnerable to betrayal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Uh huh [Yes].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">(Pause): [0:40:21 0:40:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: So, yeah, I mean, maybe.
