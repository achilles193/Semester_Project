Don't ask that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D91\">question if you're not going to have intentions in some way, you know. Don't waste the time. Especially if you're just asking to let me know [inaudible 12:52].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">[Yawns.] I frequently talk to her after this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">THERAPIST: What's it...yeah.

Like a big wall comes up so often here and we always talk about money. Although my two brothers have been reaching out and more actively like hey, let's hang out. Oh okay. You know, sure. He called me the other night and he's like yeah; yeah, I just had a talk with my dad about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E11\">a lot of stuff that happened when I was a kid. I'm like yeah. He's like yeah. Do you want to come over and hang out or do you want to talk on the phone? What? Oh, yeah, I can come over. About 15 minutes? Eighteen. Okay. See you in 18 minutes. He's very exact in the amount of time that it takes him to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E12\">walk from one place to the other. You can call him. I'll be there in six minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Well what did he say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: Well, he comes over to the basement and talk. He said I never anticipated...that sort of thing never occurred to me, but he's like yeah, a couple of things I want to talk about. Dah, dah, dah, dah. I was like, momma said he sexually abused me, but I don't have any memory of that. You know. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E51\">he's like, and also, she said when she married you she found child porn in your closet. And he's like so what's up with that? And he's like, no you're right. He's like never done anything. I know the one time I had to wipe your butt and she freaked out about that, because he was like a baby. You know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E52\">And she got all \"you can't do that.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560019\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">[15:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: So she wrote down 20 incidents where she thought Kevin had been sexually abused. James was like; I think she thought if she wrote down 20 that one of them might be true. You know. And there were no criminal charges. She talked to the priest about it. You know. The priest was like; well you've <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB1\">been sexually abusing your son. I'm not going to report that. She was talking to a priest. He's part of the clergy or [inaudible 15:46] clergy. Don't understand the responsibility of being a clergy. Had no training. He was just someone they picked for three years. I'm absolutely [inaudible 15:55]. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">My sister told her priest that she had been raped by her husband numerous times, and he's the Chief of Police. He's like I'm talking to you now as your priest, not as the Chief of Police. These aren't distinctions he's allowed to make. He's also recently fired for a sexual harassment scandal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Good. Church just turned its...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. Those things are uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: Pray them away. If you pray enough about it; we don't take action, but pray about things until they go away. If they don't go away, we just keep on praying because we're not doing it right. Pray if it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Did he grant your mother's divorce?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: Oh, they granted her like the super divorce. Yeah, the super divorce. They give you a momentary...the break the seal that you got in the temple; the eternal bond, you know. My mother had to get written permission for divorce; not from the fucking father's office. The prophet of the church, [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200F91\">17:12] a divorce. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and they do nothing to kind of say hey you need to get psychiatric help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">[17:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">THERAPIST: This is above and beyond what we can handle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">CLIENT: No that's not...nothing is above and beyond what we can handle. The power of prayer. Insanity. Fucking insanity. This is why anyone who admits to being a member can really marginalized. It's terrible. It's absolutely terrible. And the fucking idiots who are believing it. Like again, the infection <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201031\">problem. If you were infected as a child, then we can do some work. Let's see if we can...were you infected as an adult? Then you are a useless piece of shit. Absolutely useless. Nothing worse than a mid-life conversion to faith. Completely disgusting. Despicable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">THERAPIST: That's criminal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">CLIENT: Insulting, revolting; just absolutely awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">THERAPIST: It's criminal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

Everyone would believe her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: And she would pull it off, you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: People believed her about all sorts of things. That her back was broken. The nurse believed her that her back was broken; she was paralyzed. But they didn't do any tests whatsoever. You know. One day she's having a heart attack. She's like James; I'm having a heart attack. Oh fabulous, he says. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201251\">You're not having a heart attack. He's like \"Wendy, Wendy please. I'm having a heart attack.

I'm like she's not having <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201252\">a heart attack. And like somehow a local member gets called. He comes over. I'm like someone finally calls the ambulance. The paramedics arrive. And they're like you're fine. Bridget was freaking out and the guy is like your mom is faking it.

He goes like, recited some factoid; some ridiculous factoid and that it...and friends agree [inaudible 21:12], right in the book. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201291\">It's like are you sure it was a book?

My mother met her and talked to her and asked her to come over and she saw nothing. Sent to countless psychologists who would meet my mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">THERAPIST: Are you serious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah, they saw nothing. Yeah, my mother sent me to see a psychologist when I was 5, a play therapist, who was very impressed with my ability to organize. In fact, my need, my immediate need to organize things that were disorganized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">THERAPIST: Jesus. Well you know where that came from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and there was this other woman in Middletown who was a church member. And she met with me and Bridget several times. And my mom finally asked her what's wrong with my son. She said he can't handle it. And we stopped seeing her. There was another...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560019\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Who can't?

That same place sent us to a separate psychologist who showed us a lot of pictures, a lot of family settings. It was like talk about this. And I was like well what did she want to hear. And so I would craft these very normal <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F1\">things to say; very typical sort of things. And I mirrored off of better families than somewhat ours. [inaudible 23:41] you know. It was all very crafted. And this became a thing. I realized that a lot of people in your profession aren't very smart. This is a key problem. A lot of them aren't very <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F2\">good. They don't understand; they don't understand a lot of things and they are easily manipulated. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: You're saying they can be fooled pretty easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">[24:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">CLIENT: Well yeah. They're like oh, what's this? What are you feeling? I'm like, okay, what am I going to project. You know. And like what are they expecting here? What is the answer they're expecting from this question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">CLIENT: Fine. Here it is. And they don't expect 9 year olds to do that to them. You know. They don't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">THERAPIST: And they're maybe also willing to hear it because they want to see...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">CLIENT: They don't want to deal with anything else. They all met my mother. So three psychologists there; four psychologists met my mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Are you serious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">CLIENT: And then the psychologist she sent us to when...just before I left home, she was seeing a psychologist and sent me to see the same one.

Because he was weak. Because he was so weak and needed to be good at his job. Like I don't know why...I couldn't figure out the motivation. He just needed to be good at his job so badly. And he wasn't. And it was so easy to tell him how and why he wasn't good <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2017B1\">at his job. And then he just cried. Right there in front of me in the office. A grown man crying in front of a 15-year old boy who just took his life apart. You know. The school recommended him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017D\">THERAPIST: This guys they were finding...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2017F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, awful.

You know. He was much more like you. He'd be like doing his job. He actually knew what it was he was supposed to do. And so I loved him. I'd see him like once a month, you know. I was 17 I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah, he was super great.

And so it was a real sort of like battle back and forth, you know, in that one session. [inaudible 28:57] intellect. Everything you've shown me is that you're not very smart. You know, and like I looked at all those books on the shelves <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D1\">and I'm like so like addiction is a big factor for you. And he was like, what do you mean? So you have all these books on addiction, you know. He was like, well you don't know. I'm like you have like half your book shelf is on addiction. Like you talk about like addiction is an issue for you. So what <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D2\">are we talking about? Why are you so interested in addiction? Like why do you want to study that? You know. He said this isn't about me. I said, well I think it is about you. If I'm going to trust you for an hour a week, then how do I know you're not broken? You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">[29:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: How did he treat you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: Combatively. You know. So I remember the guy I saw before Julie...I think his name; I don't know. I don't remember his name. He's over down south on the way to Cole. And he's fucking fragile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Before Penelope or Julie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: Before Penelope. Penelope I saw before... He was just very fragile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, you told me about him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he was also just very much collecting a paycheck. You know, it was really evident that he wasn't engaged, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">THERAPIST: He was between Brown and Cole?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. In an office above the building. And you know, I would complain about my job and he would complain about his except it was much worse. Yeah. I'd be like my fucking job. He's like well you have great health insurance. I don't get health insurance. My boss is an asshole. My boss is mean. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF1\">So I don't get health insurance. I have to pay for all of it. I'm like why are we talking about your problems now?

No nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">THERAPIST: He didn't write you back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">CLIENT: No that was it.

This is the problem with the soft sciences. It's easy to fake your way through. That's it. It's easy to fake your way through. I got like a fucking B+ in Intro to Psych without going. Right. Without going because it's really easy. Intro <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C31\">to Psych is incredibly easy. But you know these concepts are not difficult. The motivations that people have are not difficult. How to get at these motivations also not particularly difficult. Like I think; well if you're smart, it's not difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: But what I think you're getting at though is that...one thing I'm hearing about what you're saying is you can be...you can jump through all the hoops and do everything you're supposed to do and be a good student and everything. But when you sit in the room with somebody, do you really want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C51\">go there with somebody? Are you willing to really listen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Are you capable is the question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: Are you capable. Ginny was furious. She came back from a funeral furious and I've rarely seen her incredibly angry. It was some of the sexiest talks ever. I love to see her angry. It's just wonderful to know that she has that and it's good. It really; it indicates a strength that I otherwise <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C91\">would not be able to respect her as a person was she lacking. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">[33:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">THERAPIST: That she can get pissed off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">CLIENT: Yeah. That she chooses not to hurt people. You know. This is an important distinction. So she came home furious. She was attending someone's funeral and she's like and the priest was bad at his job. And she's like you have a responsibility when you are clergy to be really good at your job. Actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF1\">people are counting on you in some of the most difficult times in our lives. They're counting on you. And she's like...and so this Catholic priest like Catholicism is one of the fucking worst religions just because it's fucking witch craft, and they're like witch craft. I've never been to a Catholic <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF2\">ceremony until I was like in my 20's and I was like this is Wicka. This is all fucking like Celtic pagan witch craft. This entire thing. And then some Roman discipline. Like what is...this is fucking ridiculous. You guys burnt people as witches at some point? Was that really based off of this? This <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF3\">is like...this is witch craft. You're burning the incense to clear the space and fucking like blessing water that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">THERAPIST: All the rituals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's all fucking elemental magic.

He said a thing like when he met the daughter he was like there's no way <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201D91\">this is the daughter; that woman looks younger than she does. I'm like, what? What? You look older than your dead mom breathing woman? You know, it just went on like this. And she's like so furious because he was so bad at his job.

They won't let women in. And they won't let pedophiles in anymore. And so now they're really running out of people.

None <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202471\">of them even called the police and everybody saw it going on. No one did anything. I think that's what...it occurs to me that with these psychologists and these clergy, they saw stuff and they did not want to pry open anything or do anything. They did not want to act.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20249\">CLIENT: Yeah, because of a real weakness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Out of a real weakness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024D\">[44:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2024F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm going to be a psychologist so I can help people; so I can help people with their stress and their sadness and their mommy issues.

I'm like wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20255\">THERAPIST: Why wouldn't you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20257\">CLIENT: Why wouldn't you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20259\">THERAPIST: Why wouldn't you like them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B\">CLIENT: It's like how many of them have I made cry? And the answer is almost all of them because there weren't difficult puzzles to solve. Like there were other issues so close to the surface. I told her if I actively stopped doing this...Penelope and I were like this is something I do; this is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2025B1\">I try not to do, specifically not to make Penelope cry. See if I can go through this without making Penelope cry. She probably cried quite a bit actually thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025D\">THERAPIST: How so? What...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025F\">[45:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20261\">CLIENT: Well some of these horrible things I tell people. You know, and she cared about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20263\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20265\">CLIENT: And she's a woman and therefore raised to be closer to her emotions. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20267\">THERAPIST: It's probably a good thing that she did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20269\">CLIENT: Hold back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026B\">THERAPIST: Well she could hold back, but she could feel it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026D\">CLIENT: Yeah, well I think she was...I'm afraid to engage, you know. Again, it's a real weakness and it's weakness that makes me sick. Just to do nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20271\">CLIENT: To have the responsibility and to do nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20273\">THERAPIST: You know, I think it's an understandable kind of a real powerful rage you feel of people not really responding. Not being able to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20275\">[46:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20277\">CLIENT: Well I think; well I mean I notice, one of the things I hate the most is someone who will not take action, you know. People who lack decision [inaudible 46:38]. When someone's like, when I'm like okay, let's use food. What do you want? Oh, anything, I don't care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20279\">THERAPIST: You do care. You do care. Very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20278-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20278-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560019\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B\">CLIENT: I can think of something to order that you won't like. And so I do that. Okay, how about we go get like Thai food. I hate Thai food. Okay, so you care. What do you want? Anything. Not Thai food. Vietnamese food? Is that what you get then? It's like you do care. You know what you want; you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2027B1\">hoping someone else will say it so you don't have to say pizza and subs. Let someone else say pizza and subs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D\">THERAPIST: Well I think too what really gets at you is that when people are not wanting...are kind of defensive with themselves, with having a response to you, or anything for that matter. In other words, like a psychologist that wants to look the other way or wants to tell you well your problems aren't <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2027D1\">so bad; listen to mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2027F\">CLIENT: Right. What the fuck is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20281\">THERAPIST: I think that's about...when you react that way it's because I think you're reacting to their defensiveness. You're reacting to your inability to kind of go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20283\">CLIENT: Well yes. I mean I was presented them as they would get inside my head and figure out what was wrong with me. Alright. That's how the psychologists were presented to me. They would figure out what was wrong with me. And so this all of a sudden just became a fight. I'm like okay. So you're going <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202831\">to try and get inside my head. Let me see if I can get inside yours. And Carl, it's not that hard. Do you understand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20285\">THERAPIST: Understandably. Why wouldn't you want to get in their head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20287\">CLIENT: Why not? And again, you don't expect a 9 or a 10-year old, or a 12-year old or a 15-year old boy to do these things, you know. You don't expect him to look in and see that your greatest fear is [inaudible 48:39], you know. I mean you don't look at them and explain to them how they cannot understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202871\">what you have been through because their life has been too easy. They don't want to hear these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20289\">[48:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028B\">THERAPIST: It's funny; I almost hear it as like if you could have them go there with their deepest fear, maybe they can help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028D\">CLIENT: Maybe. But their deepest fear is ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2028F\">THERAPIST: Well yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20291\">CLIENT: Their deepest fear is laughable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20293\">THERAPIST: And you're sort of saying can't you just go there with, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20295\">CLIENT: Yeah, like are we going to play or are we going to fuck around? You know. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20297\">THERAPIST: Not wanting to fail. Not wanting to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20299\">CLIENT: Whatever their fucking fear is. Whatever typical tiny fear they've got and they went to be a therapist so they can fix themselves. Like whatever. Oh no. Did your parents buy you the wrong color car? That's hard. I had a girl with that once. Parents bought me a green SUV and I wanted a red one. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202991\">Oh that sucks so bad. That sucks so bad. God, you should use your sexuality though, so. [inaudible 49:48].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B\">Yeah I do. People; a lot of people are weak and that upsets them. They don't know what to do. They don't understand. So like Charles said...he was like I just like...I get it because like what I don't understand is what Bipolar is like. And so I was like, okay; here it is. You're fast. Faster than other <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B1\">people. And you're getting faster. So then you can see the future very clearly. The scenarios run full length before you and you can process them faster than anyone else can anyway. And so you can effectively see the future a few steps ahead of everyone. So now you're fast and you're getting faster <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B2\">to the point now where you're even way more smarter. And you're so much smarter than everyone and you can't help but feel like you're better than everybody. And actually, you are right now. You can see the future faster than they can. But then it gets to the point where you're too fast and everyone <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B3\">is moving slowly as if they're molasses as if to piss you off deliberately and it's stupid. It's so fucking stupid. But you know with clarity what's happening because you can see the future. And you know that you're going to run out immediately and you're going to drop. And then you know once you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B4\">there that you won't know where you are anymore. And then you lose it and then you're depressed and you can't see anything. You can't see forward at all. You can't see past your present suffering, and you don't know when it's going to end until you start to come out of it and then you can recognize, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2029B5\">ah, I must be depressed. And he's like interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2029A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2029A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560019\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029D\">[51:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2029F\">So when I get depressed, I know I'm depressed. I know if I sleep enough it'll go away. And I was like, that's nice. Like that's typical. Like that spells depression. Like oh, you got sad. And you took a long nap and now you feel better. I'm like that sounds really nice. And he laughs because depression <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2029F1\">sucks. I'm like you don't even know man; you don't even understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A1\">THERAPIST: Well I think the other thing too that we've been talking about lately is you're not only dealing with that, but I think you're also contenting with what could be very powerful intense anxiety. Like the kind of anxiety you have when you're at the top of a roller coaster and you feel like you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202A11\">about to...is this thing going to stay on the rails? I mean you know, and people, I think, don't understand that or see that very easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A3\">I was thinking about that car ride. You know, going on a car ride with the guys down. Like you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A5\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A7\">[52:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202A9\">THERAPIST: It's not like, oh yeah; we might get in an accident. It's like it's a whole other life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AB\">CLIENT: When you go to your next psychologist's convention, whenever that is, start swinging. Start knocking people over and stand on their bodies, you know. And there are people like, I am better than most of you. Except that whoever you look up to in that community. But, you know, whoever those people <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202AB1\">are. But everyone else, you just mock. Just tell them they suck at their jobs because they know. They know. And they'll get defensive and angry and some of them will be just hurt, but they'll know. They'll know. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AD\">Well Monday, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202AF\">THERAPIST: Monday it is. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B1\">CLIENT: I'll call Carla what's her butt and see what she has to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B3\">THERAPIST: Carla Francis. Yeah. I think you'll enjoy meeting with her at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202B5\">CLIENT: Well, I imagine.
