So\u2026 I\u2019m broke. That sucks. Um, but I\u2019m handling it a little better. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to\u2014you know, it\u2019s like this unemployment thing\u2014not being unemployed, but the unemployment checks, they fuck you up, you know, because you have to weigh what kind\u2014you know what I mean? Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">my friend Casey who has\u2014he has two jobs, okay, he works at the airport as well. He\u2019s like, \u201cI can you get you a job at like an airline,\u201d or whatever. And at first I was like, \u201cFuck yeah, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d And then I can fly wherever the fuck I want and all that. But the way they do it you have to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">part time, and they pay something like $11 an hour. So basically I\u2019d make less than I get. You know, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Or like even adjuncting. I ran into this poet I know and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, you should send me your think because we need adjuncts at Loyola College,\u201d or whatever. Not that I want to drive to Loyola College. But then on my way here I was doing the math. I was like, wait a minute, adjuncts, you get paid <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">like two or three grand. Well, that\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m still making more on my unemployment. I just\u2014 [2:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So it almost doesn\u2019t seem worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well, it isn\u2019t worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: [unclear]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: It isn\u2019t worth it, yeah. Because then what happens is\u2014not so much with the adjuncting. Well, the adjuncting just isn\u2019t as much money as the unemployment. But let\u2019s say something that\u2019s right around the same amount. The problem is any job like that is clearly not like a permanent job. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">what I mean? How long would I work at an airline, it\u2019s just a job. So then what am I going to do? You know what I mean? Or what if it doesn\u2019t work out or\u2014you know, it\u2019s not worth then having to go through the hell of restarting your unemployment again. You know, like that was a kind of night\u2014at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">for me. It wasn\u2019t a very fun experience even doing the whole process, you know. So that\u2019s just\u2014it just fucking sucks. That\u2019s why tutoring would be so great, you know. But there\u2019s just no\u2014it\u2019s just unbelievable. You know, it\u2019s just cash, something that\u2019s cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Sure. [3:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: But, you know, I went on Craigslist again last night. It\u2019s like, oh yeah, like 15 bucks, $17 an hour. I\u2019m an Yale student, 17 bucks an hour. It\u2019s like, well\u2026 I\u2019ll go down to 45 bucks or something, but I can\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m not going to tutor for $15 an hour, you know. Anyway, something will work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: When\u2019s your unemployment up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I think in the Spring. I think April or May. I think there\u2019s an extension. I think you get like one extension, or something like that. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. So I mean something\u2019s got to happen before then I hope. But yeah, I mean, the weeks fly by very quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s not that far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s not that far. That\u2019s why the condo thing is very important. You know, because that would make a difference. You know, again I\u2019d have to crash with my mom. Then all that\u2014my mom\u2019s pension and our rental income. The rental income would just be\u2014it\u2019s 20 something grand a year. Yes, part <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">of that you\u2019re going to pay to other things, but whatever. Even if it\u2019s 10 grand a year you know that you have actual income from there, you know.

I should be able to opt\u2014or there should be something that says, \u201cYou know what, I want to keep getting my unemployment <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">and working until\u2014\u201d Like there should be some, I don\u2019t know, like get you back on your feet month or something, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just silly. It\u2019s like, well, what the fuck does that mean? So then why\u2014of course why would I give that up? I mean, it\u2019s giving me more than most of these other\u2014I mean\u2026 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">don\u2019t know. But, you know. [6:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">And I was like, well, you know, yeah, I could suck it up and move back down with my mom and rent out the third floor, you know. But I just\u2014I refuse\u2014I just won\u2019t do it. I just\u2014that\u2019s one thing I won\u2019t do, you know. I just keep\u2014I can\u2019t.

It\u2019d be different if she had a big single-family home, where somehow I could really have a little bit of a corner. I mean, this is a\u2014it\u2019s just a three-family house. I mean, there\u2019s no escaping\u2014 It\u2019s just I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. Even in a single-family home I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just\u2014you know. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">got to be a time when come hell or high water you just that\u2019s it.

The condo you were selling, if I remember. [7:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes, because remember I was saying once that condo is sold it\u2019s not just\u2014because let\u2019s say right now I crash with my mom, right. What\u2019s going to happen? Like, yeah, that\u2019s a little bit more money per month, but we\u2019re still plugging holes. Like in other words nothing major\u2019s going to\u2014so I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">to be stuck there. But when that condo is sold, and now those two units have no mortgage, that\u2019s a\u2014now you\u2019re talking $700,000 equity. That\u2019s all equity, right. So then it\u2019ll be much easier to borrow $350,000\u2014to borrow half of that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: On the reverse mortgage you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: On a regular, even a regular. At that point we\u2019ll try to get a regular home equity. Say like I\u2019m buying another property, I want\u2014you know, because now there\u2019s\u2014now we don\u2019t have to try to find other ways, it\u2019s all equity, there\u2019s no mortgage, we\u2019re more qualified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re not going to run a credit check to do that though you don\u2019t think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sure they\u2014no, no, I\u2019m sure they will. Well, I mean, my credit\u2019s improved. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s improved, yeah. And again, now it\u2019s different because that\u2019s a much more\u2014your collateral is all cash, you know.

You\u2019re not spending that on the mortgage. But regardless, even if we did do a reverse mortgage. Whatever we did. In other words, there will be a way to take that. Yeah, then it really is a temporary situation. This would not be temporary, I would be fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">stuck there. And even if I got a full-time job I\u2019d be stuck there. It\u2019s Darien, you know. You need thousands of dollars to get an apartment. It\u2019s not like, \u201cOh yeah, I have a thousand dollars, I\u2019ll get a\u2014\u201d No. They want first, last, this that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561580\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Of course.

That would be ideal, if there was someone that just had a bedroom, and if I said, \u201cListen man, I\u2019m in a bad way, if somehow I could stay here for six months.\u201d You know. But I don\u2019t really\u2014I don\u2019t have that. So. [long pause, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">one minute] In the meantime I was hanging out today\u2014yesterday actually, and today, at the Assyrian newspaper where I used to be an editor. There\u2019s this guy from Cairo, journalist from Cairo, two separate friends who we are from the same circle, but these are, you know, slightly older Assyrian guys. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">They both called me yesterday, they\u2019re like, \u201cThere\u2019s this guy we want you to meet.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhy?\u201d They don\u2019t really do that, you know.

Our families are both <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200513\">from the same city in Turkey. And yeah, really, really sweet. So I was just there, I\u2019m definitely go back from here.

But my mom, because of her father, it went more into like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">the humorless side, you know what I mean? My grandpa just didn\u2019t\u2014I mean, he would just get so worked up, and he just didn\u2019t have a sense of humor about things.

And then he would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201392\">like explode, he\u2019d have times when he kind of, you know, explodes.
