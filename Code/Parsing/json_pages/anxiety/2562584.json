I couldn\u2019t concentrate very well. Obviously, I was thinking about doing it. The fact that I just did it . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: And then what stopped you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yesterday was a little bit different because I actually didn\u2019t have a lot of free time. My friend, who is going back to Assyria, is here so we spent almost the whole day together. Two things were good about that.  One was I kind of started feeling excited, so that was nice. It\u2019s a nice feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to know you\u2019re going to get there and one of your best friends is there. I kind of felt some of the excitement that I\u2019ve been wanting to feel a little bit. Then we went to see this movie, Her. Do you know about this movie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: The man character falls in love with his operating system. We went to see it and we both really liked it. It was really interesting. It made me think of two things.  One was there is a good scene in it where he\u2019s talking to his best friend and he kind of finally has a moment of self-awareness <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">or self-understanding; and he\u2019s just so genuine and it\u2019s sad. He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want. I never know what I want.\u201d That really struck a chord with me, that idea. Here is this guy who has a nice life, but he\u2019s just gotten divorced, even though it looks like he didn\u2019t want to get divorced. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">There were a lot of things that he said that really resonated, I think, probably with a lot of people. That\u2019s the whole point of the movie, I think, that a lot of us are fucked up in this similar way, like he can\u2019t express himself, he shuts down when he\u2019s upset instead of him just saying that he\u2019s upset. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">All that stuff.  That moment I was like that\u2019s the thing, man. I think of all the women I\u2019ve been with and it\u2019s very confusing. What am I looking for here? Then that made me think, because of what we were talking about yesterday about Assyria, I thought that everything with me boils down to that \u2013 a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">combination of never knowing exactly what I want and how to express myself.  It\u2019s this combination of not knowing what I want and not understanding myself at all, like not really getting me. The reason I thought of that is because I thought about all the things we\u2019ve talked about, like you publish your <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200195\">book but then it\u2019s like whatever. But then, like with women, that\u2019s the ultimate example. Like right now I\u2019ve got these three or four that are texting me all the time and can\u2019t get enough of me. And I\u2019m not saying that I should feel like I\u2019m fucking amazing. It feels good, but I think that on some level <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200196\">I still don\u2019t get that. I\u2019m not faking anything; I feel confident. I feel good, but on some level I don\u2019t get that level of reaction. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t get what they\u2019re drawn to in you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Let\u2019s say some women are kind of exaggerating their flirtation. With a good percentage it just doesn\u2019t sound like they are, not to write the kinds of things or say the kinds of things they say. I just don\u2019t get that. Part of me just doesn\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t get it \u2013 I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">not faking anything \u2013 but I don\u2019t know what to do with it. That\u2019s what it is. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s connected, in a way, to your question of what do I want? Do you want that? Is that really what you\u2019re looking for? Because when you get it, then what? So what, in a way.  On the one hand, I think it\u2019s always felt like the thing that would be most satisfying, to have someone react to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">you \u2013 really, really wanting to be with you \u2013 but then you get it. Then you do get that all the time; and then what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s baffling. I don\u2019t understand. In some ways, I can\u2019t do without it because now that I\u2019m not faking anything or now that I understand it all better, it just feels good. I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s fucking awesome to have these great girls clamor over themselves, but there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">is a disconnect. I guess I just don\u2019t get why it\u2019s so strong. Let me put it this way, a lot of times I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not having that reaction.  Why am I like \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way about anybody?\u201d I have moments when I feel that way, but no. So what\u2019s that? Am I so mangled now that I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">know if I love somebody, like I can\u2019t differentiate anymore?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re asking both then why such a strong reaction? That\u2019s a very particular reaction. That\u2019s not just desiring or wanting to get to know you. I\u2019ve never felt these feelings before so quickly, so suddenly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a lot of lustful\/visceral or something. It\u2019s awesome, but I still don\u2019t quite \u2013 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say about all this.  On the one hand, I guess it makes me kind of sad and confused \u2013 like is there something I\u2019m not getting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: About yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: About myself or something, and that makes me feel that if they feel that way, maybe there\u2019s something, again, it\u2019s about my potential. Maybe that means I could get the kind of girl I really, really, really want if I\u2019m getting this reaction all over the place. Maybe I\u2019m not channeling myself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand this shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You have gotten the girl you really, really wanted, though \u2013 several times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Have I? That\u2019s the thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Well, in the moment I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve often said \u201cI wanted the perfect girl and then she came and I found a way for it to not work out.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. Yeah, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: In other words, that can be part and parcel of what you\u2019re saying. What\u2019s happening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: What\u2019s going on? Right. With some of them, I\u2019m sure, who knows what could have happened. Some of them clearly could have lasted a number of years, at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You did come in with several saying \u201cI am madly in love.\u201d \u201cThis is the one.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Exactly. So what is that? It\u2019s never like \u201cshe has a kid.\u201d No, there were plenty that didn\u2019t have kids. I know enough to know the Assyrian thing is real and not real at the same time. I\u2019m already bracing myself for that because I\u2019m going to get to Assyria. They\u2019re women like any other women <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">and when I do find the one, when this happens over there, then I\u2019m going to find something \u2013 they\u2019re not American enough.  They don\u2019t get my American . . . I\u2019m already preparing for that. I seem to always find a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s likely, being perfectly honest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Seeing this movie it was like what do I do about that? He found a solution because he found it with his OS and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s voice, so that\u2019s not too shabby. That is a solution because, of course, that person never leaves you. I won\u2019t tell you what happens. It\u2019s love, but you\u2019re still <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">kind of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not physical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Exactly. It\u2019s not someone in your space, really, sharing your life. It\u2019s someone in your earbud.  Not someone \u2013 that\u2019s the point. Highly intelligent. I don\u2019t know. But then, of course, the flip side of it is my friend, Diego, who is married and has two kids, he was like, \u201cYeah, it made me think <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">about my marriage and what the hell is going on and why I\u2019m not happy. I was happy five years ago.\u201d It\u2019s like the grass is always greener. There is obviously no simple, clear answer to any of that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: There is something about how you started today, saying that you got to read a little bit but actually today was unusual because you were out with one of your close friends yesterday all day.  It does make me wonder how much woven into the day-to-day decisions about how to spend your time <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">is the question of what do you want? Yesterday, you didn\u2019t write because what you wanted more was to hang out with your close friend. It\u2019s one day where there was something else you wanted more, but then you kick yourself for not writing. The idea of dealing with many things you want, actually, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">there are a lot of things you want. You want someone who knows American culture. You want someone who knows Assyrian culture. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And when you pick one, you can\u2019t have another sometimes. Or sometimes it\u2019s not possible to have all things \u2013 many times. Picking out a person to spend a life with means you\u2019re letting go of certain things you want. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: What are the things that are most important to you? They are the priorities. And what are the things you\u2019re going to let go of and mourn? It\u2019s not in the realm yet of consideration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Maybe I\u2019m spoiled that way. I\u2019ve never been married. I never had a long \u2013 other when I was very, very young \u2013 so maybe I\u2019ve been spoiled. I just want all of it. It would just be great to have all these people who are, obviously, all different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: It is, but it\u2019s not having one long-term person. You don\u2019t get the things that you would get with that. If you go with that, then you lose what you get with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Exactly, because then I\u2019d worry that if you pick that one person I\u2019m going to end up like a lot of my unhappy friends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I think one of the things is reaching the point of realizing that you actually maybe are making decisions based on what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I know what I want more than I think I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Maybe you don\u2019t want to get married because you don\u2019t want that and many, many marriages head down really bumpy roads where you get sick of each other and disappointed in the other one. That\u2019s actually part of marriage. If marriage is working, that\u2019s part of it. Maybe you don\u2019t want that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">That\u2019s different than not thinking you want it and then kicking yourself and being mad at yourself for not having it when, actually, you keep deciding that you want this instead. You might actually decide one day that you don\u2019t want this instead, that that\u2019s losing its attractiveness and that you\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">take the disappointments that come with marriage for the things that you get out of it that you\u2019ll never get out of here.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. Yeah, I see what you\u2019re saying.  I guess I\u2019m looking at the nuance aspect of it, though, where I could have had some of those people. I could have had kind of both. In other words, there were some who were so cool. They literally would have done almost anything. I could have still <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">retained whatever this life I have is; and because that person loved me so much, they would have let me be . . . They knew that I didn\u2019t want such a domesticated, suburban feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Were you thinking of Meredith?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Michelle. Meredith, not so much. I think Meredith did want it. Clearly, she got pregnant and got married a year after we broke up. I think she wanted that. Michelle. Meredith, not so much. I think Meredith did want it. Clearly, she got pregnant and got married a year after we broke up. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">she wanted that.  But yeah, there have been a few where it could have been. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: And yet, there have been times where you\u2019ve said \u201cI think I don\u2019t want to continue in a relationship where it\u2019s not going to head towards getting married,\u201d if she\u2019s old and she doesn\u2019t want to have a kid again. I point it out only because I think that has poked its head up as a desire of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">yours. That doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the only thing you want. There are some times you think \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere near that,\u201d but you\u2019ve used her not wanting that as a reason to break up with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s true. It will never work with someone with a kid. Never. I\u2019m someone who likes to pick up and move, obviously. I like that. It\u2019s scary, but I do it so obviously I like doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: So Michelle wouldn\u2019t? It wouldn\u2019t have worked? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. So how is that going to work out? The expense involved \u2013 that\u2019s not good for a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So there is a reason where, when you actually get to the heart of it, it\u2019s not that it could have worked with Michelle. If that feels real to you that, actually, the lifestyle, the kind of life that you want can\u2019t involve someone else\u2019s child right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Or even being married. Even if there isn\u2019t a kid, that\u2019s still not easy. You\u2019re married. You can\u2019t just up and decide \u201cI\u2019m going to move to Assyria.\u201d What if that other person just does not want to? They have their own good reason for not wanting to go there. What the fuck are you supposed to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">do? I guess you could argue it\u2019s the opposite. I\u2019ve always actually done and gotten what I want, in a way.  I didn\u2019t become an accountant and then be a musician at night or whatever. That\u2019s what I want to do and that\u2019s what I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: And yet there is still the fantasy that you could do and get what you want and it is impossible in life, right? No one gets everything they want. By not becoming an accountant, you don\u2019t have financial stability right now, so there is a loss that you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Every decision you make you have to not make other decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: It has losses. Every single path you go down you have losses, including yesterday when you saw your friend instead of writing. That was a decision and you may feel really good about the decision, but that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a loss. (pause) How you spend each hour of the day, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">picking one thing and not another thing, not many, many, many other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: I did work on songs yesterday. That kind of made me excited, too. I was like, \u201cI want to play some of these songs, just acoustic, and see what they sound like;\u201d and they sounded good. I was like, \u201cYou know what? I think this could be awesome in Assyria.\u201d There is nothing like this over there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">I could probably pay my rent playing two or three shows a month over there. Also, I\u2019ve noticed when I was playing and singing, thinking about being over there, something felt different in the songs. In a way, I felt more reconnected to my songs. I think that\u2019s what happened. I just felt more excited <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200792\">because here it is what it is. It\u2019s the same week in and week out; and I just don\u2019t get excited anymore to play San Diego or whatever.  I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not doing anything for me; whereas in Assyria I feel like it\u2019s different there. If people really respond to the music, I feel like it has a deeper <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200793\">meaning over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: For you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: For me and for people there. (pause) At the end of the day, I\u2019m not sure, but there could be a different connection that I make with an audience there that I can\u2019t make here because there is just something unspoken. They might pick up certain things that are in the tones or the performance or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">whatever the fuck it is that people here respond, as well, but in a different way.  Especially when here it\u2019s a dime a dozen; they see me one night and they can see a bunch of other bands the next night. So even if it\u2019s good, it\u2019s like \u201cI saw this; I saw that; great stuff; all good.\u201d Whereas there I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D2\">feel like it can have a different kind of impact maybe. Again, if nothing else \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to get all lofty \u2013 at least I can pay my fucking rent, I think, from what everyone is telling me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And also, if nothing else, you worked on your songs yesterday. It\u2019s actually a moment where that\u2019s what you chose to do. You were motivated to do that, not to write. That doesn\u2019t mean you might not one day. Just because you\u2019re staring at something doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to want to or it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to feel as important as something else you also can do. It is writing, true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: I think it felt good that if this is true and either pay my rent or pay half my rent for playing shows or whatever, I think it\u2019s also the idea that it means that even more than here I\u2019ll be a working artist. That takes it to a different mentally that wow, I kind of like that, thinking of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">as a fucking job that I love. It\u2019s not just playing someplace for $20 \u2013 or even if it is $20, (chuckling) over there that\u2019s a lot of money. Whatever it is, your rent is so cheap that all you\u2019ve got to do is play a couple of shows for $30 or $40 and you\u2019ve paid your rent.  When you can say that you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200812\">pay your rent from your art, that\u2019s a pretty awesome feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: And rare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, and rare. I\u2019m not trying to romanticize it or whatever. From what people are telling me, that seems highly possible. Regardless, even if I played shows infrequently, I feel like I can just sense something there \u2013 that people my age, and especially younger, there is definitely some kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">of underground, bohemian sub-culture, artsy thing going on there and I think it would feel good \u2013 for me, but also to maybe share something that means something to these people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: You keep saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to get all lofty or get ahead of myself\u201d and it\u2019s true. You can\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go with any certainty until you get there. What you can know and start trying to work through now is what you want; all things considered, would be where you want to be and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">what you want to be doing. This brings it back to the question I\u2019ve reminded you of several times. Since the unemployment stopped I asked you if you could have the same job here would you want to stay here? You said \u201cno.\u201d So even when the choices were open, you were pretty clear that\u2019s where you wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">to be. Of course, there are hesitations and questions you\u2019re trying to continue to sort through, but articulating to yourself that that is what you want to go after is the start of actually making it work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m realizing that, yeah, I want those things to happen. It\u2019s okay to want it to go well. These days I\u2019m so scared. I\u2019m like \u201cI\u2019m getting ahead of myself,\u201d but that\u2019s not the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s different than expecting it will happen in a kind of self-illusory way. You want to be realistic about something; will it work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: But actually all the things I want are realistic in this scenario. I\u2019ve worked hard. I have a job; 99% likely. There seem to be a lot of other job opportunities from all the people I know and all my contacts and all that. Music \u2013 every single person I talk to says there is a hunger and there <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">is no one doing what I do over there and the fact that I\u2019m American but Assyrian. There are ingredients there that are really going to maybe connect with people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s realistic. There are a million other things that you could do instead that are also realistic. Starting to say \u201cthat\u2019s the one that I want to go do; that\u2019s what I\u2019m committing myself to,\u201d and knowing that you\u2019re letting go of things by doing that. You could be gaining a ton \u2013 that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">what the hope is \u2013 but you\u2019re also letting go of things. Even in marriages, when marriages are healthy and actually pretty happy are when people have really arrived at a place of knowing that there are certain things you don\u2019t have in this person and they\u2019re worth it. There are things you get that really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F2\">make you want to stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: Because that\u2019s probably a beautiful feeling, too \u2013 wow, I\u2019m willing to give up all these things for this person. That\u2019s an amazing thing. Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s real then. It\u2019s not an idealization or a devaluation; and that\u2019s the same thing as going to Assyria, to say this thing is worth what I\u2019ve given up for it. At least it feels that way now and you\u2019ll go see.  If you change your mind you\u2019ll do something else. (long pause)  I think when you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">so hard-wired with all this dysfunction, these fuckers over here, that\u2019s the other thing. You\u2019re constantly second-guessing yourself. They\u2019re so unsatisfied with everything that there is some of that in me, so like with Meredith. Even if they weren\u2019t going to work out, to bail so quickly, that wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200932\">me. To not be able to see that holy, shit; there is this stunning girl who . . . And then also to not see that I made it happen. To not be like how awesome is this? I met this girl at a bar and she\u2019s moving with me to London. What are the chances of that? I did it. It was natural. It felt organic. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200933\">was amazing. That part bums me out that I couldn\u2019t . . .  I see that now when I meet women. That\u2019s great, but it is a bummer that I just couldn\u2019t see any of that then, how amazing that is, to be grateful for it, to savor it. It\u2019s like that\u2019s how they are. There is never a moment when they can just be <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200934\">still and just enjoy. It\u2019s just impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: There is so much of a disavowing of being owners of their own lives and I think it\u2019s just insidious and seeped into you, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: And even if you get something you really want, someone has something better so there is someone better than this woman.  I\u2019m being very superficial but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: No, it\u2019s there. It\u2019s deep; [it has been superficial] (ph?) throughout with that side of your mom\u2019s family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: I know. It\u2019s a fucking crime for one dude to have such beautiful women, a lot of who are also very cool, nice people \u2013 flawed, but we all are. There is someone better; there is this; this is fucked up and that\u2019s fucked up \u2013 just nitpicking. That bums me out. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not like that anymore. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">That\u2019s good. I think that movie is part of what got me thinking about that a little bit. In a way it was very comforting because it was weird with this movie. I think Diego felt this way, too, because obviously a lot of people who go into see the movie are a certain crowd. So a lot of people in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B2\">theatre were around our age, slightly creative types; you could almost taste it in the theatre. We were all sad. (chuckles) In that way it was a little comforting that this is like a pandemic now. We don\u2019t fucking know what we\u2019re doing. In the movie he goes to chat rooms to try to not feel lonely. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B3\">gets set up on a date. It\u2019s just all the stuff we all do. Looking for people online and trying to find people \u2013 all this loneliness and trying to piece together some fulfillment or a connection, a real connection to somebody. And then not knowing sometimes whether it\u2019s a real connection or not, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B4\">I think was it kind of silly, the operating system, but I think it was symbolic that\u2019s the thing.  Are you really connecting with somebody? What\u2019s the difference between this person and this person? Which one of those was the real connection? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I also think there is something about how intolerable your mother\u2019s criticism and nitpicking and claustrophobia negativity was; and that then her own looking at you with eyes that were so critical all the time and negative, in a way, that meant that there was never any room in that relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">for there to be a tremendous amount of love, even when you\u2019re disappointed in a person sometimes, that\u2019s actually a part of good parent-child relationships, too.  Nobody is perfect. Parents screw up. Kids make mistakes, but the feeling that that is ordinary and part of actually really good, healthy <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D2\">loving relationships . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">CLIENT: Right, the foundation is solid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yes! And that you\u2019re human, so you disagree all the time and get in each other\u2019s way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: But you always have each other\u2019s back. Yeah, in my family it doesn\u2019t exist. They\u2019ll say it, of course, to their death they\u2019ll say that it does, but it doesn\u2019t. A smothering kind of love is not having someone\u2019s back. That\u2019s just projecting all kinds of shit on somebody. Having someone\u2019s back <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A31\">is like \u201cIt\u2019s fine. This didn\u2019t work out? Cool. Why don\u2019t you try this?\u201d without judging. Even your tone of voice \u2013 instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t know. What can I say?\u201d \u201cTry that. Try that one. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d  No, you already sound like you\u2019re judging. They just don\u2019t get any of that. They don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A32\">understand that your tone of voice \u2013 forget the words you\u2019re saying. They could be the right words, but if you\u2019re using a certain tone of voice . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Think about when we were talking about how when you\u2019re dating if she starts talking or complaining, you said you immediately get to feel like she\u2019s complaining and she\u2019s talking too much, your mother\u2019s intrusiveness, judgment, critical; that is not a space of negotiating between two minds. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A51\">That is like the stuff of marriage where there are two people who like some of the things and don\u2019t like other things and get annoyed at each other that never got to happen. It\u2019s been for the longest time in here I felt like whenever I talked it was more like intrusiveness into your space, like it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A52\">not wanted.  Very recently, there is a little more of you feeling like wait, there is another person over there who actually is outside of whatever you could construct about it which is really different. How do you deal with the \u201cotherness\u201d of another real person when your mother\u2019s otherness was extremely <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A53\">hurtful every time, that you shut down from taking in the other, which makes dating someone where you have to grapple with otherness. It\u2019s not you you\u2019re dating. It will never be. (chuckles) She\u2019ll be disappointing sometimes. She\u2019ll wear the wrong shoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">CLIENT: Or she\u2019ll be disappointed in me. It\u2019s not the end of the world; whereas for me, all those little things are colossal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Humiliations [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">CLIENT: Or like crazy red flags that I have to . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Right, like any disappointment could be a red flag. No, any relationship that works is going to have disappointment. Hopefully it has a tremendous amount of other things that make those disappointments worth it. (pause) Sometimes the wrong shoes, even, could turn into something like that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD1\">her. It\u2019s not my favorite, but that\u2019s when I know I\u2019m dealing with her. That\u2019s her choice and I love that person.

Not enough doing and too much thinking. Obviously, I\u2019m very proactive, but that does bother me that I catch myself a lot. I\u2019m just constantly fucking thinking.

Taking all your choices like which choice is right? I hung out with my friend; that\u2019s it. There is nothing to think about. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? Or I\u2019m going to read a chapter of this book. There is really nothing to think about here. I\u2019m going to read some words on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF1\">page and then I\u2019m going to move on. I\u2019m not like that. There\u2019s this constant, fucking engine. It\u2019s gotten better. I think that\u2019s part and parcel of all these things that I\u2019m saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Because thinking and a way of putting over-thinking implies a kind of cognitive level of ruination that is not about being grounded in yourself and what your gut is telling you is the right thing for you to do.

I think you\u2019re talking about being in the realm <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C12\">of not knowing yourself, that\u2019s not always intuitive. There is a lot of second-guessing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">CLIENT: Right, so instead of being like cool, I\u2019m going to go to Assyria \u2013 like really, what is there to over-think, in a way? I\u2019m going to go. I\u2019m not going to a place where I don\u2019t know anybody. I have this whole network where I have good friends and acquaintances, people I don\u2019t know yet, but that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C31\">people are introducing me to. What\u2019s the big deal, really?  Yes, I\u2019m horrified that I might have to come back and then I have to stay with my mom. Literally, that\u2019s it. (chuckles) I have to go back and stay with my mom. But yeah, you cross that bridge when you get to it. Also chances are that\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C32\">going to happen. Realistically, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen. That happens with a lot of things. I\u2019m getting better at it. I notice now when I\u2019m on dates that I\u2019ve gotten better at just being with this person and even if I\u2019m like yeah, I don\u2019t know \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m here now. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C33\">a nice time. I\u2019m getting better at it, but these bigger things like my art and careers and these bigger questions \u2013 not necessarily the day-to-day . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Or marriage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: Marriage, yeah.  It\u2019s gotten better, but I have to work on that a little bit more. It makes you waste energy and time sometimes because you\u2019re not quite able to focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Again, quite able to trust. That\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s a leap of faith going to Assyria. It\u2019s a leap of faith for anyone getting married that you don\u2019t know where you\u2019ll be five or ten years from then. It\u2019s the idea of trusting yourself that you\u2019ve used your good thinking capacities and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C91\">makes sense. You actually have thought it through and you trust your gut sense that this is a right thing to do. I think you\u2019ve had some other decisions where you feel like the only way you\u2019ve made it was to do it without thought. Sometimes you\u2019ve been so burdened by thought, over-thinking, that the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C92\">only protection would be to not think too much at all and do something on impulse. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562584\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CB\">CLIENT: To under-think it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CD\">THERAPIST: To under-think it; and again, that\u2019s probably actually the healthiest thing at the time that you could do because you were at least trying not to over-think it and stop yourself from going to London or something like that. You could have over-thought that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was trying to change things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Going to [Brown] (ph?); going to Oregon \u2013 some of these things if you had over-thought it, you would have probably remained frozen and immobile for the rest of your life. So you\u2019re at least trying to carve out some space where you didn\u2019t have to think too much about it. The next step is how <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D11\">do you reintegrate some thinking to get to know yourself and get to know what you\u2019re letting go of by doing this and to think through what you gain by doing this. You sound, to me, the clearest you\u2019ve ever been about Assyria with thought and with a gut sense that this could have real possibilities that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D12\">work for you on a number of different levels. We have to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D3\">CLIENT: 2:20?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">CLIENT: Thank you. See you tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
