AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:00) 6:00 PM I need to get to work early so that I can get out earlier so I can get to my appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m making sure I had it right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It makes me [ ] (inaudible at 00:00:15). (pause) I just feel overwhelmed by everything I have to get done. Just the mental to-do list is exhausting. The obvious answer is do the things that are on the to-do list, but some of them are just really intimidating.  One of the things on the to-do <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">list is deal with transferring my brokerage account; and that\u2019s been on the to-do list for four years now. It\u2019s ridiculous. I should just do it, but about three months ago I had a voice mail saying they needed to speak with me about my account. It was very serious business and stern and I was terrified <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">and I haven\u2019t called them back. I haven\u2019t been getting statements from them for the last three months, so I think they think the account is abandoned and took my money and I don\u2019t know how to deal with that. And, of course, part of me is saying it\u2019s my own damned fault for not dealing with it for four <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">fucking years and I deserve to have lost the $12,000 on the account. That\u2019s just the cost of being an idiot and I deserve it. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s really upsetting and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.  The obvious answer is call. I can\u2019t do anything until I know what actually happened, but that\u2019s terrifying. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">I sat down on my lunch break with the phone number in front of me probably a dozen times in the last three months, and just can\u2019t do it and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. (chuckles) It\u2019s just a phone call \u2013 with serious consequences. $12,000 is an enormous amount of money, but I can\u2019t do it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">it\u2019s really upsetting. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Maybe you would fear for your life if you find out that you blew $12,000.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I feel like an idiot. (pause) Dave won\u2019t help me. I\u2019ve tried to recruit him to help me, but every time I try to broach the subject, I fall into a spiral of self-incrimination and hatred and literally have a meltdown and start crying and am literally incoherent. And then Dave tries to calm me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">down by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay; it doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s do this some other time when you\u2019re calmer,\u201d and then it doesn\u2019t get done. And then just the anxiety mounts so the next time I bring it up, the meltdown is even worse.  I don\u2019t know how to tell him that I just need him to just sit with me and hold <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">my hand while I make the call \u2013 or even just make the call for me. Since we\u2019re married, I think legally he can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: He can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) It\u2019s really frustrating to me, but when these sorts of things happen, he focuses on sedating me, really, instead of doing the thing that would help me not need being sedated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Which I imagine feels like it kind of confirms yeah, this is too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: And also that I\u2019m a fuck-up. (sighs) Or like another thing that\u2019s on the to-do list: Dave still hasn\u2019t called and made an appointment to get his sperm tested, and it\u2019s like (sighs) I\u2019m tired of nagging him about it.  (pause) I don\u2019t know what to do about that either because every time I try <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">to bring that up he\u2019s too tired or he\u2019s too stressed or he\u2019s had a busy day and can we talk about it later. Even if I bring it up at 11:00 on a Saturday after we\u2019ve had a leisurely brunch, he\u2019s still too tired and too stressed and too busy. Well, there\u2019s never a good time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562164\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s suspiciously like he does not want to have that tested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh) (pause) I don\u2019t know. This wasn\u2019t as big a deal when I was 28, but I\u2019m 32 and that\u2019s edging into the risk curve for birth defects and it\u2019s really frustrating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: As far as the call, you\u2019re welcome to call here, if you like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Okay. I might take you up on that next week. I don\u2019t have the account numbers with me. (pause) Neither Dave nor I are good at dealing with paperwork, so we have a stack of mail that\u2019s literally four feet high that neither of us have gone through; and God only knows what horrible surprises are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">lurking in there.  I get stressed and panic doing anything to do with money or bills, so when we got married Dave took over that part of the chore list, so now I\u2019m responsible for more \u2013 I don\u2019t know. The division of labor falls awfully close to the stereotypical [center line] (ph?), which is upsetting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">(sighs) Dave is also not good at it, only instead of stressing about it, he just doesn\u2019t do shit. So our car insurance didn\u2019t get paid for a year and a half and I didn\u2019t find out until I called to get my batter jumped and they were like, \u201cWell, we canceled your policy because you didn\u2019t pay.\u201d I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">like, \u201cYou can\u2019t just not pay the car insurance.\u201d But at this point, neither of us have filed the incoming mail for over six months and I\u2019m terrified of what\u2019s in there. The longer it goes, the more terrified I get. But clearly, I can\u2019t count on Dave to stay on top of things, so I should just take it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">over. But that\u2019s enormously difficult for me and I need coping skills for just being able to do the stuff that needs to be done that functional adults do because this is the world we live in.  And to be a functional adult, you have to be able to deal with paper. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">Dave doesn\u2019t have life insurance because when his old company sold his group, we were able to get on my insurance policy because there was a life-change circumstance and I signed him up for life insurance.  The life insurance company said he had to go fill out a form and so I gave him the information <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">to fill out the form and he didn\u2019t do it. So then he didn\u2019t have life insurance until open enrollment happened a year later. And during open enrollment I signed him up for life insurance and there was the form that he had to fill out \u2013 medical history, that sort of thing \u2013 and this time I tried filling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">it out for him, but there were questions that I didn\u2019t know the answers to so I asked him to tell me the answers and he didn\u2019t. I begged him in person and he kept saying, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later.\u201d And I bugged him on IM and I sent him e-mails and I gave him a blanked out form and said, \u201cYou can just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200273\">fill it out,\u201d and he didn\u2019t. So now he doesn\u2019t have life insurance again until the next open enrollment. (sighs) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">I just have this huge list of things in the back of my head of things that I should be worrying about because what if they go wrong? And I don\u2019t know if the problem is that these are actually important things that need to be dealt with or if this is pathological anxiety for anxiety\u2019s sake on my part. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">But it\u2019s enormously draining and actively prevents me from doing other things because every time I try to do something in the realm of self-care or dealing with other stuff that I can deal with, like stuff with my press, all of these worries raise their ugly heads and say, \u201cThis is more important. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">should be worrying about this instead of them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562164\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Right. Like you should not be doing something that you enjoy or that\u2019s easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. I guess the term I want to use is \u201ccognitive load.\u201d There is just such a huge load of background processes that there are no cycles left for . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Other things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s really super frustrating to me that Dave refuses to talk about this and when I bring it up, he turns it into a \u201chow can I calm you down and placate you and get you to stop freaking out,\u201d as opposed to \u201chow can we deal with the problem that\u2019s causing me to freak out?\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: The images that come to my mind about these what you\u2019re calling background processes, are more something like this is the stuff of a childhood nightmare. [ ] (inaudible at [0:12:01]) It\u2019s terrifying.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s really lucky that Dave and I both happen to have jobs that pay very well because I\u2019ve lost count of how much money we\u2019ve lost over the years to late fine and cancellation fees and renewal fees because we both suck at keeping up with this sort of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: At the moment, I think that what I hear, in a way, is like he seems impotent about this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing any better, but at least I\u2019m willing to admit that I\u2019m bad at it instead of saying that I\u2019ll do it and promising that I\u2019ll take care of it, and then not doing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: [I think I\u2019m kind of a little like him to you, in that you want a strategy. You want something, I think, more active from me, like \u201clet\u2019s bring this stuff in and let\u2019s look at it. Let\u2019s go through it\u201d or \u201chere\u2019s what you can do: do some deep breathing and do this and do that and the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">thing when it happens,\u201d like you want me to give you something or take charge of this because you\u2019re making it very clear you really can\u2019t handle it. I guess it also feels like I\u2019m not really doing anything to handle it either, nor am I admitting really that it\u2019s because I can\u2019t. [00:15:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I think it\u2019s more that you won\u2019t. (pause) I just don\u2019t understand how one phone call can be on my to-do list for four years and not get done. I feel really ashamed about that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: As I said, it seems to me that at least part of it is you\u2019re so scared of how angry you\u2019ll be at yourself that you\u2019ve lost the money or something like that, although it clearly didn\u2019t start that way. I can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019ve set yourself up in this to sort of keep a level of terror and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">shame and guilt in your life for some reason \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s a thing people do sometimes \u2013 or if there\u2019s something else, like if you\u2019re just so intimidated to do anything about these things because they all make you feel so crushingly incompetent.  (long pause)  I guess the other motive in here with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">me is that I think, from what you just mentioned, you feel like you\u2019re just sort of here writhing pretty much in front of me over this.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562164\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: And so ashamed and intimidated. (pause) I guess I would imagine that\u2019s probably how you also experience my not doing something more instrumental to help you. If it\u2019s that I won\u2019t, it must be because I know you know intellectually this is not the reason, but that you don\u2019t deserve it and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">because you\u2019re horrible.  I guess that\u2019s what I imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: I would be glad if that were not the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: I would like to think I understand your reasoning for not using instrumental solutions well enough that I wouldn\u2019t have that reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I guess, again, if that isn\u2019t how you feel I\u2019m glad of that, but in my mind, the way this sort of thing works, you could understand intellectually perfect well why I don\u2019t help in a more strategic instrumental way and still feel kind of, at some level, like it must be because you\u2019re horrible <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">and don\u2019t deserve it.  That feeling and the understanding are different. That may still not be how you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Okay. I\u2019m just saying that in my mind, the one doesn\u2019t preclude the other. That\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Mostly I just feel embarrassed to admit to you how much of a mess my financial status is right now. My parents are totally neurotic about keeping track of money, to the point where my dad saves receipts and will also break down the amount he spent in a ledger and then compare the amount in his <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">ledger to his credit card statements.  He keeps track of his money to the penny and checks his brokerage accounts daily. It drove me nuts when I was growing up because he would give me my allowance and then he would ask me to account for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: In the same way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: In the same way. I wasn\u2019t do this for my [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:23) or the 65-cent candy bar at school between classes when I was starving. (sighs) So every time I try to tackle the financial paperwork I feel like if I\u2019m not keeping track of it to the same literally neurotic extent my dad does, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200551\">then I\u2019m not doing it right. And so then I try to set up a system where I\u2019m filing everything and keeping everything and have everything in a ledger, and I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s way too much work and I resent it. I don\u2019t want to do it and then it just piles up. Lather, rinse, repeat.  It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200552\">good, right? Like my dad, I don\u2019t have a budget; and to some extent that\u2019s okay because we both have frugal tastes and we earn enormously more than we spend, so we don\u2019t have to budget for things like dinners out because we can afford to eat out as often as we want, wherever we want, and it won\u2019t hurt <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200553\">us. We won\u2019t overdraw our checking account. It won\u2019t impact our long-term retirement saving or our ability to pay rent. But I expect that once we have kids and we have more expenses and we have a bigger apartment which costs more, that won\u2019t be the case anymore. (sighs) But every time I try to do things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200554\">there are tools that you can just dump all of your data and we pay for almost everything with credit cards or our debit card instead of cash, so it\u2019s easy to track.  But then I get obsessive about I have to categorize everything correctly and every expense has to go in the right column. There are all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200555\">of these expenses that you have like lunches in the cafeteria or hundreds and hundreds of transactions. Or paying for parking to come here. That\u2019s paid for on the debit card at the garage across the street and it\u2019s like, well, how do I file that? Do I file that under transportation? Do I file that under <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200556\">medical expenses? I actually spent three minutes staring at that a couple of months ago trying to figure out where to file it and gave up in frustration. I tried using just a spreadsheet. I\u2019ve tried using [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:51). I\u2019ve tried using another open source tool that I can\u2019t remember now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200557\">It always ends the same.  (sighs) It\u2019s really frustrating. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562164\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: I can see how [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:31) between you and your dad where he had some completely ridiculous standard that you both wanted to adhere to and feel like is really how you need to be in order to be okay; and then, at the same time, feel is completely ridiculous and resent the hell <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">out of.  Then there is just this total breakdown where there is nothing redeeming anywhere about any of it, nothing understanding and not being able to do it and not understanding the system that\u2019s set up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: I literally have no idea what a healthy level of engagement would look like for financial stuff for a reasonable adult of my income level.  I have these friends, Timothy and Janice, who are, in order of magnitude, wealthier than I am. They both come from old, blue-blood country-club families <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200591\">and Timothy got very lucky in the start-up game, so they own two vacation houses, for example. Janice works part time. She has a PhD and she works part time as a glorified secretary, basically, and raises their kids and spends 20 hours a week on hacking the financial system. I can\u2019t think of a better <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200592\">way to say it \u2013 opening credit cards for points, closing them before fees start rolling in, transferring accounts between brokerage firms, dealing with banks, playing the points game with travel because Timothy travels for business a lot. He\u2019s the CEO of a company of 4,000 employees, so he travels a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200593\">lot.  So playing the points game and getting free things from points. Every time she talks about this to me I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong with my life because there is all this money just lying on the table that requires no work. It requires time and energy and understanding and that\u2019s work; <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200594\">and I\u2019m doing other things with my time like working full time and running a business and editing a magazine on top of that and having a social life and singing in choir and piano lessons. If I didn\u2019t do any of those things, if I only had a 20-hour-a-week job and the rest of my time was devoted to finances, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200595\">I\u2019m sure I could figure it out. But I feel like a loser if I can\u2019t and also like . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I can imagine that, at some level, with all of those realities, that you can imagine they should just go out the window and this is how your father\u2019s daughter should do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Of course, my father has no hobbies. He goes to work and comes home and watches MSNBC or Fox News now. He used to watch some of these shows where they did mostly financial news and nothing else, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve shifted their focus or they\u2019re more political. But he comes home and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">he watches the news. He watches cable news and deals with money. That\u2019s all he does and that\u2019s really depressing. I don\u2019t want his life. Intellectually I understand that my neuroses about money come from my father and that there is some kind of healthy balance that is not being my father and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D2\">have to live up to his standards, but understanding that intellectually hasn\u2019t helped me actually deal with money in a healthy, reasonable, sane way.  (sighs) I wish understanding your neuroses actually just made them magically disappear. If that were the case, I\u2019d be doing really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562164\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019d be out of a job. (chuckles) I don\u2019t mean just with you; I mean in general. I guess hopefully part of what you mean by that is [being really tolerating and really looking at the intolerable, unbearable aspects of the neuroses can seem to ameliorate them.] (ph?) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think I understand what you meant there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: Intellectual understanding is good, in a way. It\u2019s better than not having it. No question. At the same time, I think how it can also function for you is to distance yourself from what\u2019s so much more disturbing in the neurosis, which functions to preserve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: That I\u2019m stepping back from it and analyzing it instead of pushing through it, sort of? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: To be more specific, the phone call, let\u2019s say. It\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re terrified of how angry you\u2019ll be or might be, and it\u2019s the specter of that. There is the shame and incompetence you feel the longer it has gone on. There is the way this is one corner of a larger picture about you and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">your dad about finances. I\u2019m not saying these things are separate. And, as you say, the kind of anxiety and terror about those things, makes them really hard to bear, I think, and what makes it hard to pick up the phone.  And, I guess, I have two follow-up things. One is there is a [ ] (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200672\">00:34:21) in that geez, I should just be able to pick up the phone. This is ridiculous. Clearly the practical way to deal with this and make myself feel better is to just call. You\u2019re reacting to it and probably backing off of all the things that make it really hard to do that. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200673\">In a way, it\u2019s good evidence. I don\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want it to be anything like, \u201cOh, my God. If I pick up the phone a lightning bolt could strike me and I could die.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s good to say, \u201cI know that, ultimately, what\u2019s really going to help is dealing with this.\u201d But it kind of cuts both ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200674\">a little bit, too.  And focusing on that can be something else maybe you can go ahead with and be a way of backing off. The other thing I was going to say is this is why I\u2019m always fussing about things between what I think are between you and me. That is how this becomes a kind of hothouse or the more <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200675\">neurotic feelings around these kinds of things makes them, thereby, easier to get a hold of. However, now I have been pulled into providing a more conceptual overlay it occurs to me.  (pause) I guess it\u2019s, in part, probably me reacting, I think. I would imagine a feeling that you have that you\u2019re kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200676\">of not getting anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562164\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: With any of this. You come in and talk about it and what happens? Look at all the ways it\u2019s impossible and untenable; and it feels unlivable and you\u2019ve been demoralized. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m always demoralized, though. That doesn\u2019t signify anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I think it probably recapitulates, to some extent, some of the stuff you\u2019re [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:19) with your father. I have this impossible way of doing this that\u2019s supposed to work and it\u2019s both the case that I identify it being impossible because somehow you\u2019re supposed to be talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">about this and it\u2019s supposed to be making things better if you do it just the right way. You are either not good enough or you\u2019re buying into the wrong way of doing things; and so you\u2019re kind of upset with and disappointed in me or very disappointed in yourself.  I imagine this feels like that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F2\">way, except in a way it\u2019s worse because like the thing with your father and money you can say, \u201cOkay. Sometimes I can step back and just know this is crazy and most people I know have some middle way of dealing with this that works well enough for them. But as it is, what am I supposed to do?\u201d We should <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F3\">stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
