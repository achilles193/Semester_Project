(Pause) Sorry, I'm just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Making sure I have [them recorded] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Sure.

So I have a farm share for the summer. The distributions are at work every Friday at 3:00. This (ph), you know, company is claiming that it's a benefit they're providing to us, letting the farm share distribute in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">their parking lot, which I think is bullshit. They're not. I mean, it is a benefit for us, but it's not costing the company anything. So whatever. The vegetables come in these big waxed boxes, and we're supposed to bring them on Fridays and trade-in the previous week's box for this week's box because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">they don't have that many waxed boxes. And I forgot mine last week and had to, like, go get a garbage bag from a janitor to put my vegetables in, because they wouldn't let me go home with a second box. And I forgot it again this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">And I've just been in one of the very classical spiral (ph) for me. Beating myself up for being a fuck-up and forgetting the box in the first place. And then feeling worse. And then feeling bad for making myself feel bad, because I should know better by now. And then just (pause) (inaudible 02:55). <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">(Pause) This sort of thing happens, like, pretty frequently. Like, five or six times a day at least. But given that it was so recent, [maybe it's] (ph) an example to look at (inaudible 03:15).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I could go home and get it after this, and then go to work, which wouldn't put me at work any later than I normally get to work. But I was hoping to get there a bit earlier today, because I'm leaving for Delaware to visit my family after work and wanted to get out early. And also, with me fighting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">Cheshire traffic three times this morning (inaudible 03:57).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I even know why I forgot it last week and this week. All summer, Dave has been getting the box and putting it by the door, along with my keys and a (inaudible 04:36) for me to take to work on Fridays. But the last two weeks, I've been coming here, which is way too early for Dave to be up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: He doesn't get up, and I'm just not in the habit of dealing with the box. Because usually, it's right there by the door and I can't leave the house with it in front of the door. (Laughter) So yeah, our door opens into a very narrow walkway, so, like, there's literally no way for me to get out <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">unless I pick up the box. (Laughter) (inaudible 05:03) it's easy to remember, \"Oh, I should take this to work.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559692\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You just have to remember not to put it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter) Which has happened before. Not with the box, but with other things. Like, if I needed to take something, like, there's a letter for me to mail, Dave will put it in front of the door for me, and then I'll pick it up. And sometimes I'll pick it up before I'm actually leaving the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">house, and I'll set it down somewhere. And then it's just I'm not good at mornings. I am very grateful on most mornings Dave (inaudible 05:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">And then this morning. I didn't pack last night because I was just feeling miserable (inaudible 05:44). So I was packing this morning also for Delaware. I won't' be back for three days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: But I'm still mad at myself for forgetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess I'm not sure of what to say (inaudible 09:24).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: (Sighs) [Now there's this] (ph) situation with my parents (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: [You say] (ph) your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and (pause) (sighs) so, while we were in Italy, my mom told me about the situation that had been developing from last month with my aunt, my father's brother's wife. So she had a hypertensive hematoma episode that put in her the ICU. Her blood pressure was something, like, terrifyingly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">high. Like 300 over 180 or something. Just absurd. And it was causing her brain damage essentially, and so she was in the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: What's a hypertensive hematoma?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: A hematoma is a bruise that happens in the brain, essentially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: So a blood vessel had burst.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: There was blood collecting and putting pressure on the brain. And so, my dad had had a hematoma event also. Not hypertensive. His was caused by a car accident he was in. He got rear-ended and hit his head. And it was terrifying and scary, because my father [is my father] (ph) and he refused <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">that he was feeling any symptoms, even though he's a neurologist and should know better. And it was, like literally, the only reason he's still alive is because he went to lunch with another neurologist friend of his who noticed the symptoms and said, \"You're going to the OR right now,\" and performed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200592\">emergency surgery on him that day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">But anyway, so she was in the ICU. And this is in Ottawa. And my uncle and my cousin were trying to decide what to do, and the attending physician caring for her recommended some invasive diagnostic procedure. I don't know what it was, but it involved injecting something into her blood stream. And my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">dad counseled against it. He said, \"This is highly likely to cause a stroke. It's a bad idea. You already know she has a hematoma. It doesn't matter where. You just need to treat it, you know, X, Y, Z, whatever.\" And my cousin and my uncle decided not to take my dad's advice. Took the physician's advice, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B2\">and she had a stroke, and was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Sorry. Is that was your dad advising more or less within his area of expertise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes. So my dad's specialty is not that, but he does keep up with events in the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 12:11) so I just didn't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's not his area of specialty, but it's certainly something he knows enough about to provide sound medical advice. And, I mean, my dad will argue that he's right and the attending physician was an idiot. But I suspect, you know, in life and death scenarios, differences of professional <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">opinion are kind of legit?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559692\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: She had a stroke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: She had a stroke. And as of when we were in Italy, she had been unconscious for a week-and-a-half, and no one knew whether she would wake up or not. And my cousin had a terrible decision to make. And his father just, like, could not cope with any of it and signed over medical power of attorney, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">so my cousin was stuck with it. My cousin is about 12 years older than me, so he's in his mid-40s. So my dad according to Mom, Dad was feeling very guilty, but he didn't cancel the trip to Italy and fly out to Ottawa and be with the family. And he was very stressed and anxious and couldn't communicate <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">with them because we were in Italy, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, Dad said nothing about this. I heard from my mom later that he was furious that she had told me and my sisters what was going on. He was keeping all of this a secret from us, which is standard Dad operating procedure. He keeps <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B3\">everything a secret, all the time, from everyone. I didn't know he had started working again until he had been at work for two-and-a-half months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Wow (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. When I was younger, I was in the sixth grade, and we were considering moving, and Dad had a couple job offers that he was debating between. And he and Mom went to Albuquerque, New Mexico to visit the town and the hospital, and my grandparents came and took care of me and my sisters. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">I mentioned this at school just in passing to a friend. I told them my parents are in Albuquerque. And my friend asked, \"What's in Albuquerque?\" I said, \"Daddy might be getting a job there.\" And of course, she told her mom, and then her mom asked my mom. And then my dad was furious at me for sharing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F2\">secrets and, like, beat me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Beat me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Beat you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: [I had to pay] (ph) for telling secrets, even though he never told me it was a secret. But anyway, that's Dad. He doesn't like people to know anything about him, ever. So anyway, a couple of weeks later, I was talking to my mom on the phone, like, after we got back from Italy. And she said something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">I don't recall what she said, but I came away from the conversation with the impression that my auntie passed away. Like, I, like it's possible there was some kind of horrible miscommunication, but I hung up from that phone call thinking, you know, \"My aunt is dead. This is terrible. I should, at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">some point, send a sympathy card to my cousin.\" And I mean, I was a little bit upset but not very, because I never saw my aunt very often because my mom hated her and my dad also didn't particularly like her. And she just didn't have much access to us when we were growing up. It turns out she's still <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200773\">alive. I don't know if my mom intended to imply that she was dead. If my mom was hoping she had died. If there was just this horrible miscommunication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">And, you know, if my dad weren't so obsessed about secrecy and not telling anyone everything, this wouldn't have been an issue because he would have telling us what was going on. Because, I mean, sure we were never close to my aunt, but we were randomly (ph) close to my uncle and my cousins. That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">the sort of information that family would want to have. It's like, I can't like, just hypothetically, when I have kids, if something was happening to one of my sisters on their spouses, I would want the kids to know. Like, that's... (Sighs). (Pause) Yeah. My parents. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559692\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">I'm so tired of my parents. I'm so tired of their bullshit. And just comparing and contrasting them with Dave's parents, I mean, yes, Dave's mom occasionally drives me up a wall, but, like, the quality of that annoyance is different? I mean, I was telling a friend this and she was like, \"Yeah, but, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">you know, you don't know your in-laws the way you know your parents, and you don't have as much history with them. And, you know, maybe in ten years she will drive you crazy as much as your parents do.\" I was like, \"Well, I've known her from ten years.\" Like, at this point, I think if she was going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B2\">to be as horrible as my parents, I would have figured it out. Like, we butt heads. We have disagreements. But they're all (pause) things reasonable people can disagree about? Right. Like, (pause) she's not crazy is what I'm saying, I guess. My parents kind of are. And she's not mean-spirited and she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B3\">not selfish. She's a little bit controlling and demanding, but she is used to having her own way. And I don't like it when she doesn't get her way. But (pause), like, she is a little able to comprehend that other people might want different things than her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">It's a little sad that I start to feel (pause) what's the word? I am happy to see Dave's parents several times a year. I want to see them several times a year. If we go too long without seeing them, I start to think, \"Oh, we should plan a trip to see Dave's parents. You know, that would be nice.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">Whereas with my parents, I dread seeing them. I never want to go see them. Yeah. I'm never excited to plan a trip to go see them. (Sighs) And that's sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well, (clears throat) you know, what you said, my hunch is that you're feeling sort of a little free or more comfortable talking about some of the stuff that was upsetting from a few months ago, like the incident you just mentioned. And also, not just the incident itself but (inaudible 22:37) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">your parents and, like, the perspective you have on that I guess, like, relative to Dave. How you see Dave's parents. For example, Dave's mom in particular. And that (pause) it does make me think also of what you said, naturally, about the wax box and how, you know, when Dave can be there for you, like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200832\">(pause) you're more able to manage stuff. And I imagine you have perhaps a bit of a feeling of, you know, Dave being more there or more available in some way. Maybe partly because of how you've been talking about things the last few weeks. Maybe (inaudible 23:39). I'm not sure. But that has something <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200833\">to do, I suspect, with (pause) being able to (inaudible 23:59).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: What's on your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: (Sighs) Oh, I was just recalling some conversation that I'd had a friend of mine (inaudible 27:39) about my parents. This friend of mine also works in journalism, except she's trying to make that her full-time job, whereas I'm just dabbling. But we had talked earlier this week about some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">the stories we had been reading in our respective slush piles. So slush is the term for all of the stories that get submitted for publication. Usually, they're mostly bad. Following Sturgeon's Law, 95 percent of them are crap.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559692\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 28:17)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Sturgeon's Law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: which is that 95 percent of science fiction is crap, but that can be applied to everything. (Laughter) And, like, this is the unpublished stuff, so it's probably more like 99 percent is crap. (Laughter) And so, because I read slush for a magazine that (inaudible 28:38), a lot of really terrible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">human beings take that to mean rape. Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape. And so, on any given week, like, a third to a half of my stories are just rape fantasies from the perspective of the rapist. And, you know, they're usually pretty obvious within the first couple of paragraphs. And I send a rejection <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">letter and just move on. But then there are some that are just astonishingly bad, even given the background level of, like, expectations of badness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">So there was a story about two weeks about a rapist who had died, and his afterlife was being sodomized by Jesus still nailed to the crucifix, repeatedly, for all of eternity. Yeah. There was another one about a teenage boy who was tormented by guilt even because he looked at porn and then masturbated. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">And he was so tormented, and the only way to end the torment was to castrate himself. There was another story written from the perspective of a duck who was getting raped to duck by other ducks. Yeah. It's (laughter) and so, yeah, (inaudible 29:56) had an equally horrible. She had one story and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200932\">main character had all kinds of weird objects come out of his butt, including a person who's surname was Strange. (Laughter) Because he had a trans-dimensional portal in his butt. (Laughter) Like, just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">And so, anyway, I was telling her about my parents and just, like, what the fuck. And her comment was, \"Your parents are even more baffling than duck rape. I don't have anything else to say. I don't know what else to say.\" Yeah. I was just remembering that conversation. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Reading slush (inaudible 31:19) made me feel far better about my own work because, you know, I'm certainly no, you know, Virginia Woolf or Faulkner, whatever. But at least I'm not writing (laughter) gang rape by duck. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 33:00) but this story about rape fantasies are pretty (inaudible 33:04) interesting. (Laughter) Like, I don't mean to say that the writers are all screwed up. I just mean that, like, the particular arrangements of [metaphor and symbolism] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Provocative (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: There is a shocking number of stories that are just, like, straight-up murder revenge fantasies where there's a male protagonist who brutally murders, sometimes rapes and murders, a wife or girlfriend who has in some way snubbed him. There is, you know, three or four of those every week. They're <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">terribly boring and predictable. They're never competently executed. They always have clunky, awkward prose and it's just, yeah, really gross.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I guess I also imagine I'm not, like, (pause) maybe (ph) I'm not, but there might be something reassuring in it, in as much as it makes this sort of normalizing.

I don't mean that I think you have those kind of fantasies. You've never mentioned that. Only that it would make it feel like, in the spectrum of things, some things that you heard about or have happened to you are not as far out there as some things feel like. But I appreciate <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">that you were saying that's not the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And in fact, it's much more that it's just disturbing to read about and know it's (ph) out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like, it's just (pause) so, I don't think it's fair to judge people from the content of their fantasies and violent or disturbing fantasies. Like, as long as they stay within your head that's, you k now, fine. Lots of people have those. But there are trying to get them published in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">fairly in a magazine that has fairly large readership compared to the rest of the field, which is just there's seems to be no awareness on the part of these authors that these fantasies they have are disturbing (laughter) and perhaps not appropriate for being published. Like, there's just a level <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">of hatred of women apparent in these stories that really disgusting (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">And, I mean, on some level, I knew that, like, this is the (inaudible 37:01) lots of men have, like, deep-seeded rage and hatred and fear of women. And, you know, if that weren't the case, we wouldn't have a situation where one out of four adult women in this country will have been raped at some point <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">in their lives or, you know, whatever. But I had thought that that wasn't this is going to sound stupid because, of course, I've been assaulted twice now. But I had thought that, you know, that wasn't a thing in my community with, like, my, like, broadly defined communities that I move in (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B72\">37:37) past that. And that's not the case, because these are people who are part of the community, and they're certainly not a part of my circle of friends, but they're there. They go to the same conventions and parties that I go to, and they're in my world. And they have these really distressing ideas <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B73\">about men and women and the relationships between them. And that's frightening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I'm not sure what to make of the connection, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Are you going to connect this to the vegetable box?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: No. (Laughter) No, I'm not going to connect it to the vegetable box.

Lucy is in her 60s. She's an immigrant. She attends my church, sings in the choir.
