Because I mean I have to submit my budget for like the entire year. And I should have done it, you know, a couple weeks ago probably. But I'm trying to get this information from the health insurance. And I've been able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">figure out some stuff about what the plan is going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Who is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: This is the health care for Suffolk University.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: The student health care plan that I'm going to be going on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: in February, if not earlier. And I'll be on it for quite some time. And, I mean, I've been trying to do this after hours, like after five. So it's impossible to get folks on the phone. But it's a student plan, but I think it says it's a PPO. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don't know what that means. What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: That means you can see people that don't take your insurance. It will cover visits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: That's better than the other? What is the opposite (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It's actually really Well first of all Well here's some things. One is that it kind of will work like your plan does now. Actually, I take this insurance now but I'm not going to be taking it starting January first. You know, I'm not going to be taking insurances. But if you have a PPO <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">plan, they'll cover the visits. And not only that but the plan will cover twice a week. It will cover multiple times a week. It will cover three or four.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: When you say the \"Plan\" can you even say that with certainty without knowing like the details of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: As long as it's PPO. And the only other thing, yeah, I can say that if it's Well, no I can't say that with certainty. You never can with insurance companies. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But with people that I see with PPO, they don't manage, there's no management of a mental health benefit. Which means that it's up to the discretion of you and me how often we meet. They don't -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah. At least at current. Now the only thing that, with a PPO plan not the HMO plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I'm on an HMO now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: I'm on a PPO?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You're on a PPO. The basic different between any HMO and a PPO plan, as far as I know, all HMOs you have to be an in network. You have to see somebody that's an in network provider, that is, has agreed to, and is on the panel of health care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: So they are considered less desirable then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I think sometimes they can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: [Well, regardless anyway.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well the HMO, the plan itself, yeah, is much less desirable but it's cheaper. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Cool. Okay, I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: And the PPO plans for other means you can see anybody you want. Now there's been a lot of, like your benefit for instance, they will manage your out of network benefit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Actually, it's a big legal question whether they actually can because it's considered, lawyers consider that discrimination against mental health care versus like, you know, they don't manage other benefits. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Anyway, that's besides the point. But just getting back to the plan, the PPO plans that people have that I see they don't manage them, with the exception of people that have certain student plans, including Yale and Amherst. They will have like a limit to how many visits you can have, like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">twenty four or something like that. And it's basically the way it's contracted with them. Now Emory, no problem. It's like every other PPO plan. They don't manage it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559921\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: But with Yale and Amherst, for instance, they have specially arranged contracts with the insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Mm. So then I should Yeah, man, I just need to get someone on the phone that I can talk to. I just want to figure out what that's going to be, you know, for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Like I've looked at some of the paperwork and stuff but it's really unclear. I mean I think there's something along the lines of they I mean it's going to be 60\/40 out of network for mental health. But I can't get any hard information on like the annual deductibles or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I've kind of made my budget and I'm ready to send it in if I can't get more information, assuming that there's a thousand dollar deductible, and assuming that we would be able to keep seeing each other at least once a week. And at the price that we're at now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I don't know if that's even reasonable. But, yeah, maybe what I would do is if I could I'll just at least take this like basic, like I go on the website and there's like 2012, 2013 health care plan which is already in effect that people are on. And there's all sorts of information (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">at 00:06:21) let me figure out anything else about it. But then for the 13-14 there's like this two page PDF that like is just really, really like superficial. It doesn't really have any details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: It doesn't have deductible? It doesn't have mental health?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: I mean it says like it's a fifty dollar deductible. But I know that that's not what it's referring to for I don't know. Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Okay..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: I would be shocked if It says a fifty dollar deductible, which is a combination of like in network and out of network coverage. Maybe this is just like an incredible plan -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: compared to the one I'm on now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Well for students they have less risk. There's less kind of utilization. If they can keep the cost down because they're students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, but these are student health care plans. They have a monopoly on this market. Students have to take it. You know what I mean? Like they literally have like a gun to students head. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: If you didn't have to you could worry about being a desirable product.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: I don't know. I just know that the co-insurance at US Providence is atrocious (ph), horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(pause) I don't want to talk about that anymore. I want to talk about some other stuff. It's funny. I was thinking about it a little bit today, like what am I going to talk about today. And I was thinking about that. Because this stuff with my Dad has kind of just fallen off <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">my mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: You know? It's not depressing. Even after I kind of like got to the other end of it and I got that job and I had kind of, you know, removed myself from that situation, I was happy. And for a little while I was like still really focused on how kind of glad I was that it worked out the way that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">it did. Almost with the same intensity as I was focusing on it when it was bothering me. You know? But I just don't even think, I haven't even been thinking about my Dad lately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: I mean, In a good way. I haven't really been talking to him much on the phone or anything. And I've been feeling, I've been feeling good lately in a weird way. And, yeah, I was trying to think about it earlier today. Like one of the things I thought I wanted to talk about today was like me smoking. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">Me wanting to (pause) Me wanting to stop smoking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: You know? I think we've talked about me smoking before, but I feel like we've talked about like to kind of understand it and stuff. But I almost want to talk about it more with a focus on like trying to stop doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You've been wanting to stop?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. For a little while now I've felt like I've really wanted to stop in a very, I don't know, looking at myself from a thousand feet above type thing. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: You know, even as I have wanted to be having cigarettes. Do you know what I mean? It's not as if I've like not wanted cigarettes as much, but I've wanted to like imagine myself and move towards not doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: In a weird way. You know? And at one point today I was in the bathroom, I was washing my hands, and I was like, \"Oh!\" I remember I heard one time that Matt Damon did like hypnotherapy or something, in an interview, and he said that it worked like incredibly well. And I was like, \"Yeah, I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">try that or something.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">And then I was like, \"Well, maybe I should just talk about it hear.\" Do you know what I mean?

Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I just had the thought, I wanted to like ask you.

Tell me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: When?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: About like what you had in mind about me helping you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel like it just seemed odd to me because I thought to myself immediately, if I wanted to try to stop smoking I would take like Nicorette gum or something, or go see like a hypnotherapist or something. But not -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But do you bring it here to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I feel like I would bring it here to you. But like when we talked about it last time I really enjoyed our conversation about it. But I didn't feel like we were working on me quitting smoking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: You know what I mean? Like it just feels very different. You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, in terms of me helping, yeah. No, I mean I certainly think it can be helpful. And, yeah, yeah, no, I'd be happy to try to help you out in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: It's not even It's a weird questions because I kind of know the answer to it. That like, yeah, in a way that's what I've been doing here. I've been trying to affect changes with other things. But I guess what I saw was just sort of like a distinction between this very, (pause) I don't know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">just a different type of way of approaching it, I guess. It was just a small thought. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Did you have anything in mind though? Like the way that I could come, that you'd want me to approach it, or that you felt, \"Hey, can we could approach it a different way than we're normally talking?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: No, I mean I guess I just I guess what I'm just trying to express is like I have this thought like, \"I want to stop smoking.\" And for like a brief second in my head I was like, \"Ah maybe there's like a pill I could take or something. Maybe there's like a medicine or maybe there's a thing I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D71\">can do to try to stop that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">And I guess what I just sort of thought to myself was like, it just struck me as odd that this didn't even really like seem to fit into that very, kind of these list of things like a nicotine patch or taking -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: It didn't. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: you know, taking Wellbutrin or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: But then I kind of thought to myself, like, yeah, I think this is a way. I think this definitely is a place that I would probably feel more confident about the prospects of being able to handle it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But, you know, getting off of that. I mean it strikes me, it just feels different, even just like the way that my mind has been falling on it. And it seems to be like an indicator, falling on it, like the way that my mind just sort of starts randomly to think like, \"Ah man, I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED1\">try to stop doing this.\" You know? Like that's not something that happens to me a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559921\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Oh.

It's a very different There's ways that, you know, I've always kind of thought to myself in the past, \"I need to stop smoking.\" But it was always accompanied by, you know, \"But not now.\" You know? \"I can't right now.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: You know, that that's not a priority. \"There are other more important things that require your attention.\" And, you know, it's almost like an act of comforting (ph) or something. Do you know what I mean? You know it's not right, but it's just like a coping thing to get through stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: And for whatever reason it's just interesting because for some reason I can just sort of think about that now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: I can actually think about that as like a thing. Do you know what I mean? I can think about tomorrow. I can think about, \"Wow, maybe that can be something I can work on tomorrow.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Whereas, prior to that, or typically in the past, I would think to myself, \"Oh man.

But for some reason that just seems not to <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: It more seems possible that you can consider stopping tomorrow. Is that what you're saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. For example, like a week or two ago I would have said to myself, \"Yeah, it's important that I stop smoking at some point.\" But I would have said, \"I'm going to have to deal with this shit with my Dad. I'm going to have to find a job. I'm going to have to \" You know, the list goes on. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201051\">You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">And that was always the way that I kind of thought about it.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean? And sort of the reaction to that, I noticed it. And I'm like, \"God, did I actually \" That makes me feel kind of good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: That I could think about it tomorrow and I can actually like I can actually, you know, think about ways that it could be as opposed to just even thinking about tomorrow as already hostage to concerns and anxieties. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Do you see what I'm saying? And that's just the way that I've always thought about it.

You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: And I want a cigarette right now.

I don't want to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: How can you think that there's nothing worth your attention more than going for a jog for your health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559921\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah.

You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Because it's like what? It's like you're taking out time for yourself to work on yourself.

Why do you ask?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20177\">CLIENT: I'm just curious because I had a conversation once with someone a long time ago.

I get ready pretty fast in the morning, so I'll usually hop in the shower, have some coffee and then get out the door and have a cigarette. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">THERAPIST: When you leave your place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">CLIENT: Mm hm.

She definitely, I think partially Eric started smoking at the same time as me. And he was a lot more nonchalant about it. He didn't care so much if his Mom knew. And by association like sometimes I think I might have smelled <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202751\">like smoke a tiny bit. I think she was probably very perceptive to it as well having been a smoker. So she knew that I had dabbled. But I don't think she had any idea, and she certainly doesn't to this day, that it has been the type of thing that it has been. You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20277\">THERAPIST: Like, yeah sometimes up to a pack a day, kind of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20279\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or even I think she might of thought maybe, you know, when I'm with my friends I have a social cigarette when I'm drinking of something.

And my Dad just has absolutely no idea at all. (pause) So in a way, yeah, it's always sort of been like it's never been something that I've been able to, like the identity of a smoker. It wasn't something that I sort of accepted and assumed at the time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2027D1\">It was always somehow I was very careful about it.

I really think I probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202891\">I don't know how I wouldn't have because sometimes that was, literally, like the You know, I didn't do other drugs.

I never cared much for stuff like that. I never drank. I never liked marijuana at all. Which is worse. It was the worst thing ever. I used to get so anxious.

You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20297\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking in one way it's almost that it's been a signifier, I think, for like of something. Of some inner distress that was hard to kind of, was not something you felt you could kind of show your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20299\">And it almost made it difficult to yourself.

Like I smoked because I needed <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202C71\">a way to deal with stuff.

Yeah. Well, you mean just in terms of what you're talking about, I think there's a lot to it, a lot there to unpack in terms of meaning to it. Because, yeah, there's a lot to the smoking itself that has its own kind of importance. And it also, it's like it's had this kind of critical <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202F31\">role in your life.
