I\u2019ve never really taken Benadryl before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: It makes people sleepy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Wow, it\u2019s pretty awesome. Damn. Now I get why some people take it to sleep. Last night I had like a\u2026I started feeling really itchy and I kind of have like a little bit of a rash like on my waist. It\u2019s not awful, but it\u2019s\u2026so I figured, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t take any last night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t have any. And I\u2019m also not that quick to take something. I just wanted to see, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">Again, wow. This is awesome. A few of my friends who\u2026I mean I guess this is what I should do; friends who have trouble sleeping take a Benadryl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s very common. People use it as a sleep aid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">[00:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: So, there\u2019s a lot going on. I\u2019ve been so out of it. So my mom and I talked to my uncle yesterday to get his feedback on stuff, whatever. We\u2019re going to do the reverse mortgage. My uncle can\u2019t co-sign because of his wife. He just can\u2019t do it. So my idea; I\u2019m quite nervous about a reverse mortgage, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">but my idea is if you\u2019re going to do it, like just go for it and do it right. So if we\u2019re able to get a pretty large chunk of money from the house, what I\u2019m going to do is take care of some debts, this and that, whatever. But then buy like a condo. Like almost just all in cash; I mean something very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">affordable, $250K, $240K, in that range, which you can find. Like a one bedroom condo. Buy it and either move in to it and rent out my floor, which would go for like $1,000, you know. Or fix it up a little bit\u2026basically flip it. You know, immediately turn around and make a little bit of money and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">do something with that money. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">[02:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">But it\u2019s a lot, you know. Because the thing with reverse mortgages is, I mean, the amazing part is there are no payments until my mom, one day is not around or whatever. Or unless she leaves the property. But one day it\u2019ll be all due. I\u2019ll have to pay that all as soon as she doesn\u2019t live there or she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">passes away. And that\u2019s pretty; that would be like $550,000, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">Now, my thinking is worst comes to worst comes to worst comes to worst, I mean our house is worth way more than that. But still, that\u2019s pretty daunting. I mean, you know. But there is just no choice. Right now, there\u2019s no choice to do anything else. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I am so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have taken this before I came here. Wow. Fucking Benadryl. Who knew? Jesus Christ. It\u2019s kind of not good in a way. It\u2019s like pretty intense. How do people take this shit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">[04:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Most people wouldn\u2019t take it during the daytime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Oh. Good to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: [Laughs.] No it\u2019s just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I mean it does work. I\u2019m not itchy anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you do get immune to that, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: If you could hold off and take it at night, it would probably be better for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really good to know. I took it an hour ago and suddenly it just kicked right in. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">Yeah, so I don\u2019t know. This thing\u2019s got to get resolved. I can\u2019t concentrate. I\u2019m completely scatter brained. Who knows why? Maybe I got itchy from being stressed. I didn\u2019t do anything different yesterday, you know.

Is he familiar with reverse mortgages?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">[05:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: He\u2019s heard of them, but he wasn\u2019t that familiar. My uncle has gotten pretty conservative with\u2026I mean not just politically, but he\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s about cash flow. That\u2019s a big chunk of money, but it can go fast. You know, so it\u2019s about making sure there is also a stream of revenue, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">know. And see the thing\u2026I mean, I was very honest. I was like yeah, that\u2019s all great, but the fact is we are in kind of a desperate\u2026we\u2019re not in the situation where we\u2019re going to lose our house, but we are in a situation where, literally, we\u2019re just spinning tires in mud, plugging holes, getting by. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">That\u2019s, you know, of course it\u2019s about revenue. No kidding. I\u2019m doing the best I can to get a job. He wasn\u2019t saying it in like a bad way; he was just saying, you know, this is your one house. That\u2019s your one chunk; I mean that\u2019s a big deal. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">It\u2019s like on the other hand, it makes total sense. We live in Darien. Chances are very very unlikely if you buy a condo in one of these nice areas that you\u2019re going to\u2026he\u2019s like at the worst, worst, worst, you might have to sit on it for a while in case things dip a little bit or whatever. He\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">we just keep seeing, right, over and over and over no matter what, the prices just keep increasing over time. I mean basically he agreed at some point. I mean there is no alternative. There is no alternative. We can\u2019t get an equity loan. He can\u2019t co-sign. It\u2019s just is what it is. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">[07:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What about the option of condo\u2019ing all three units and selling them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: The thing with that is I did think about\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve raised that before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, the thing about that is even when I was raising that issue, I was concerned a little bit about, you know, those can be nightmarish situations where you only have three\u2026yeah, usually condos work when there are a lot of condos. That way the lunatics and the very lackadaisical people are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">balanced by the majority of rational people. You know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">I\u2019m worried that if someone came in there and they\u2019re douche bags \u2013 because people hide that shit really well. Next thing you know your neighbor is suddenly a freak. Then, you know, Jesus Christ, that\u2019s tough. You know then we\u2019d be really in a bind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">I guess one thing I could do is suggest it to our tenant. She\u2019s great. I could be like, you know; then my mom\u2019s like yeah, but then you\u2019re basically showing your hand and she could freak out and feel like she\u2019s\u2026you know. But yeah, I thought of that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">But in a way, isn\u2019t it really the same thing, right? So we\u2019d pay off our mortgage. We wouldn\u2019t really have that much left over. Maybe $100 grand or whatever, which is great. But not to buy; not a huge down payment to buy something, right? We\u2019d still have whatever debts we have, so that money could go <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">towards those. But then really what\u2019s left? Okay yeah, there\u2019s no mortgage, but there is no revenue still. And we\u2019ve not bought another property to have more equity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: But I thought the point was to get a chunk of change so that you could get your business off the ground and then there is a revenue stream. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561750\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">[09:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well it is, but I think what happened was because this seems to be the only option\u2026the condo; my mom just doesn\u2019t\u2026she\u2019s too wishy washy about that. She gets kind of like, \u201cOh yeah,\u201d and then she keeps back tracking on that, and I can\u2019t do anything if she doesn\u2019t agree to do it with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">With this, the reason that this other idea has come up is because, like I said, if that opportunity is there, not just to take $100 grand or whatever, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to do was to buy another property. So then we could do everything. I could get my business going. I could pay off <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">some debts. I could blah, blah, blah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">And also, I don\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to rush in to anything. If they\u2019re going to give us that much, you just take whatever, $250K, $220K whatever and you just forget about that. Just like I wanted her to do when she didn\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">The things I\u2019m trying to capitalize on in my situation, right. I know about real estate. My uncle knows everything about real estate. You know, we just bide our time. We talk to a broker; we say look, when the time comes, here\u2019s my number. I want to pay cash. Blah, blah, blah, blah. You know what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">mean. Otherwise, you\u2019re right. If it was just an equity loan, that\u2019s exactly what we were going to do. Pay off some debts, business, peace of mind. Yeah. No absolutely. And we could still do that with a reverse mortgage. I just feel like it\u2019s a pretty; it\u2019s not a good deal for elderly people who aren\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">going to do much with that money except just live on it. Of course, then they have to sell the house when that person is no longer; basically the bank gets your house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">[10:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">This is a savvier use of that, which, you know, taking your money, making it work for you and not owing anything for hopefully years. I mean all that income; my mom is just going to sock that money away. You know what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">It\u2019s tricky. And it\u2019s going to be a big bill when the time comes, but my hope is that by that time I\u2019ll have two, three, maybe four properties. You know what I mean. That\u2019s always been my plan. It\u2019s like I\u2019ll buy that condo. I\u2019m buying it with cash, right. So the cash is in the condo. And I can turn <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">around and say hey; once I have some revenue coming in from a job or\u2026it\u2019s like hey; we have a three family, I have this condo. It\u2019s all paid off. Now I want to buy another one. So then that way, God forbid, when the time comes, you sell one of those or two of those, whatever, I mean, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And God forbid if she were to die early, that\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling protective of you about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is the one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: In two years\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s the one thing. And my mom brought that up too, of course. She\u2019s like, you know. I guess, then, what would happen\u2026that\u2019s why I would try to move quickly, you know, to buy another place. That way if the time came\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">[12:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: You could just sell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: I could sell. But even then I\u2019m here. I could just sell two condos of my unit. Each one would go for like $380K, whatever. That\u2019s more than what we would owe them. I\u2019d still have one unit left and a condo. It\u2019s not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And so it\u2019s not [inaudible \u2013 12:16] and we\u2019ll take the house if you don\u2019t pay them in 20 days or something. It\u2019s not that stringent. You have time to sell the condo and if the house doesn\u2019t sell\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561750\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course, because they\u2026yeah. I\u2019m going to\u2026we\u2019re going to have a lawyer look over all the fine print. But sure. My assumption would be how\u2026I\u2019ll pay you, but I just need to sell the house and then pay you. So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">But that\u2019s kind of the worse\u2026so even the worst case scenario, I mean God forbid, let\u2019s say I didn\u2019t even buy the other condo. There was just this money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You would still have the one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">[12:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, so what would happen is A.) All that money, probably, if I don\u2019t buy something else, then that money\u2019s not going to all be spent. You know, we\u2019re very, you know; you know how I\u2019ve been about that. And my mom, obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">So let\u2019s say that $250 is just sitting somewhere. So that would be part of what I just give back to them. Worst comes to worst, comes to worst, I have to sell two units, pay them off. Well, I still have one unit that I can either live in, rent, and live with; you know, if worst came to worst, came to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">worst. That\u2019s still not too shabby. You know. Still not too shabby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">I would not be happy if it went that way. But you know, what\u2019s it called\u2026desperate times call for desperate\u2026yeah. And you know [inaudible \u2013 13:38] those things too. He\u2019s like, you know, just don\u2019t do this out of desperation. But you know that\u2019s easier said than done. I was like, well, it is and it isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">out of desperation. I think it\u2019s actually very savvy. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And I don\u2019t know enough about it say whether it is or it isn\u2019t. But it sounds like it has a lot of risks and it could have a lot of upside too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">[14:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: The only few risks are, again, like I said, obviously if someone passes away unexpectedly or whatever, then you owe that money, all of it. That\u2019s one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">Two; obviously there\u2019s interest accruing. Hopefully, God willing she lives a long time. But there\u2019s interest accruing on that. I mean the bank\u2019s not stupid. They\u2019re not just giving you money; don\u2019t pay us back for now. You know. But really, those are the only\u2026you just need to be able to make sure that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">you can pay them when the time comes and not be like homeless or whatever; totally screwed. I don\u2019t see how that can happen, exactly, just because of the value of the house and all that. [Pause.] It\u2019s a calculated risk. It\u2019s absolutely a risk. But I was telling my uncle, I was like this is what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">Like if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s ambitious; I\u2019ve been wanting to do something like this for a long time. I\u2019m not going to be able to do it this year, next year. You know what I mean. It\u2019s going to take forever for things to really \u2013 not forever \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a while. We have an opportunity here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">you know. You know, of course you\u2019ve got\u2026everything you\u2019re saying is common sense stuff. Of course I wish I had revenue and rah, rah, rah. Well, that\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s easier for him to say that. We need to do something right now. We can\u2019t just dilly dally anymore, you know. Because really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200932\">what\u2019s going to happen six months from now, unless I win the lottery or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">[15:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">Let\u2019s say there\u2019s some revenue. Nothing is going to change. I still can\u2019t get a home equity loan. Whatever I get is not going to be enough to pay these slightly larger debts. It\u2019s just a reality. So I\u2019d rather do this, pay off some stuff. I mean really, all we really need would be not even close to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">like $50,000 grand. Not even close that. Pay off my friend\u2019s obligations, whatever. You\u2019re talking about a few hundred thousand that you\u2026you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561750\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">[16:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">Yeah, for a while, we might have to dip in to that, but not really. I\u2019ve been kind of getting by on unemployment. So even if I just used a tiny tiny hundred bucks here, $200, that\u2019s nothing to get you through until you, you know. I\u2019m going to be working. You know what I mean. You see what I\u2019m saying? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: And again, not to mention\u2026actually, what am I saying. We probably meet that rent. That will just cover our monthly expenses. You know what I mean. Yeah, we have to pay the property tax and insurance, but that only comes out to like $10,000 grand a year. Well, 1725 x 12 is like $20,000 grand. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">For people like us who have gotten really good at not buying shit for ourselves and you know. So it won\u2019t affect my unemployment, you know. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s bold. It\u2019s kind of a bold\u2026I think it\u2019s time. It\u2019s kind of\u2026you know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">But yeah, it\u2019s definitely making me\u2026I just can\u2019t stop.

She got back to me. She was like this all sounds terrific. She was like we do have to follow the proper channel thing. So she\u2019s like send a cover letter and your CV all that. It seems\u2026I don\u2019t know. I mean\u2026 [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Do you know what the actual opportunity will be for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to find that out. I\u2019m going to find that out. I don\u2019t know that yet. It\u2019s\u2026it sounds almost like there\u2019s flexibility. Like it sounds like it could be like I can go there and lecture for a month, I mean for a semester. It sounds like if I wanted to, there might be something kind of like a full-time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Faculty?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which that, I\u2019d really have to think about that if that were the case, you know. Yeah, I\u2019m not really sure. I\u2019m not really sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">I think even if they said there\u2019s a\u2026we\u2019ll give you, you know, how would you like to be blah, blah, blah, blah? Even then I think I would maybe say, how about I come for a semester, almost like a probation period kind of\u2026both ways. Just because I\u2019m making a huge move and I would feel really shitty if <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">I got there and then I decided to come back, but I\u2019ve already accepted this Assistant Professor thing, whatever they might offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">[19:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">It could also be nothing. You know what I mean. I\u2019m ready for whatever. They could also, for whatever reason, look at my CV and think differently. I don\u2019t know. She knows, at this point, we have a pretty good rapport. And she knows my background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: How\u2019d you know how to write the cover letter? Do you know what job you\u2019re applying for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just writing it as\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Just general interests?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019m thrilled to be considered to be part of the faculty. Either way you\u2019re going to be part of the faculty. Whatever context you go as. So\u2026I guess I could just ask her what exactly it\u2019s for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t you just ask?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Honestly, I think she\u2019s not even\u2026it\u2019s all brand new, so I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: The whole program?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, so before they just said like an English Second Language. Now they have a B.A. in English and Communications. It\u2019s like brand spanking new, which is why I renewed by interest in it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561750\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">Her e-mail was like there are plenty of opportunities to teach.

And she may say, \u201cOh, oh no, just to clarify I only meant this or I don\u2019t know; it could be any of those.\u201d Then you kind of know what you\u2019re working with. If she said we only would be interested <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">you in full-time faculty, you might just want to know what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I can just e-mail her and just say, you know, I\u2019m writing my cover letter and it occurred to me that I\u2019m not sure \u2013 what the fuck is the word \u2013 what capacity I would be there as. And you know, I\u2019m flexible. So you know, I\u2019m just curious. Yeah. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re flexible, but you might also be picky too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: Well just to let her know that I\u2019m not like waiting for you to offer me some, you know; I\u2019m just curious what it is, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">THERAPIST: In fact, you\u2019re asking what are the kinds of opportunities because you might not want some of them. You might decide there are certain things you wouldn\u2019t do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: Well that I\u2019ve already kind of indirectly made clear. Remember, she sent me a whole roster of the classes. So out of those, I told her the ones, you know. Yeah, I\u2019m not teaching ESL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">Now, if I\u2019m teaching Shakespeare and they need me to teach one ESL class, I mean you have to bend a little. You know what I mean. You\u2019re a new faculty member.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Right, but you didn\u2019t go there just to teach ESL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Exactly. That is not what I want to be known for, you know. And that\u2019s what I listed. I was like Creative Writing, Shakespeare, World Literature, American Literature, you name it. I was like, you know, I don\u2019t see any Poetry here. I can design, blah, blah, blah. So she was like great with all <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D91\">that, you know. But she did say, not because of anything I said, she\u2019s like just to let you know, just a heads up, like because it\u2019s a new department, we might have to be flexible sometimes in terms of what we teach until we start getting more. And that\u2019s totally fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">[22:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">But yeah. Like I\u2019m not going there as an ESL person. I was very clear about that. I mean just like I was clear about not going in January. Obviously I can go if I want to; she\u2019s okay with that. But just, you know, I told her. There are some loose ends I have to tie up. There are some obligations I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">and projects; things I need to see through. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">The one other thing about that house, the one other thing \u2013 and my mom actually thought of this because I thought she wouldn\u2019t want to sell \u2013 she was like, what if we just put it on the market for like $1 million. It\u2019s like what do we care, right. So it\u2019s already worth like $800,000; what if we just <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">said $1 million? If someone pays it, then you\u2019re talking about like at least, you know, $700,000-ish. I mean after everything. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">And then she was like then you buy a condo, do whatever you want and, you know, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Buy her a condo and still have it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I was saying. I was like we\u2019ll buy you a condo and then put the rest of the money away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Buy both of you and still have some money.

I mean obviously or A, B, C, but you know; yeah, but then you\u2019re house rich, but cash poor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">[23:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">So her a condo, absolutely. $300,000, $350,000 whatever; $380,000. Buy her something nice, you know. We\u2019re still talking over $300,000. I was like, then I would put that in the bank and I would fucking rent. I have no problem renting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: No, no, no. I don\u2019t mean forever. But I do believe you\u2019ve got to bide your time. You can\u2019t just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">So her a condo. Now we have, what, $50,000 grand, $100,000 grand left. You see what\u2019s happened. That will go like that. That\u2019s where my uncle\u2019s thing comes in, right. Of course, if there was steady steady income, fuck yeah. Of course; two condos. Or you know what; you\u2019re talking $700,000. I\u2019d buy like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F31\">a nice two family. I don\u2019t even need a three-family; a nice two-family; huge down payment, right. My mom can still go back to living in a two-family; rent the other one, with no mortgage. And now you have all that equity again in a nice two-family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">[25:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">But it\u2019s just tricky. These things are, you know, just tricky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">THERAPIST: That idea ends up being similar to the idea of selling one of the three.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I know you still have to deal with who\u2019s the person you sell to, but you could get picky about that if that\u2026you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah I know, but I\u2019d be\u2026you should read some of the articles\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: I know there are horror stories, because there are also stories that go really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">CLIENT: No doubt. No doubt. I just\u2026I mean it\u2019s also my mom. You know what I mean. I don\u2019t want to deal\u2026my mom\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what it sounds more like. She\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: No, but it\u2019s both. It\u2019s both. I also don\u2019t want to deal with like snippy fucking neighbors and stuff. I mean this is Cheshire, Baltimore. You know how people are around here. I\u2019m not going to deal with snippy assholes, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: Then don\u2019t sell the house to that person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting. You don\u2019t know. I mean I know that from renting to tenants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: It depends on who your agent is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">[25:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: No, no. You just don\u2019t know. People can suddenly just turn. I know that sounds kind of paranoid, but as a homeowner, when you\u2019ve had lots of tenants, you\u2019re like, you seemed so cool for a while. Now you\u2019re kind of being a little stick up your butt. What\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">So if that person\u2019s a fucking owner, that\u2019s\u2026I\u2019d rather just be free and clear either way. Either the whole fucking house for a really really good price that\u2019s well worth selling, or a different way where we keep the house. We buy something else, you know. Or, I mean, for example, even this way. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">get the reverse mortgage\u2026think of this. You get the reverse\u2026actually, wait a second.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">[26:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">The reverse mortgage, still sell \u2013 because my mom\u2019s still living. As long as she\u2019s living in that unit and she owns it. Wait a second. This is getting interesting now. Then if I approached Wendy, and I said, look; no rush. Just a thought, at some point down the road thinking about selling. If she were <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201171\">interested. So now I\u2019ve sold that unit. I\u2019ve already got cash from the house. That would be very interesting. Well anyway. Yeah, there are all these options.

And again, Wendy might be like you guys are putting this on the market? And she could want to move. Her whole thing was I want to be able to be here for a while <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201191\">until my son graduates from high school. You know. And she\u2019s a very good tenant. I guess there might be ways around that \u2013 tell brokers, tell people that look; you can\u2019t come. I don\u2019t know. Whatever. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s all worth thinking about.

The first time was just ask the guy from the bank, the guy I had been talking to. Just send me all the fine print. Send me all the forms, everything so we can have a lawyer look at it and then just go from there. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011F\">[28:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">But yeah, I mean something\u2019s got to get done. I\u2019m literally no longer able to concentrate. I just can\u2019t do it. I cannot do it. It\u2019s just not happening anymore. My mind is constantly\u2026so you know one or the other; something\u2019s got to get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: I think you have really more of a foundation [inaudible \u2013 28:56] be able to think about other things again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. And that\u2019s what I was telling my uncle. I\u2019m like, you know, all that stuff makes perfect\u2026I was like basically telling him too, we know. What are we morons? Of course we need income. You need a job, you need this. And he wasn\u2019t saying it in that way, but I was just trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201251\">let him know that I think you\u2019ve forgotten\u2026when you don\u2019t have two nickels to rub together, you\u2019ve got to do something. And yeah, it\u2019s a risk; it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that. But it\u2019s just got to happen. That\u2019s just the way it goes. And we\u2019re very fortunate in that we\u2019re not house poor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">So I\u2019m trying to think of the savviest way to do something. And, you know, including\u2026that helps you even find a job. You know I want to have more peace of mind, that I\u2019m more relaxed, I\u2019m more. You know. How the fuck\u2026I can\u2019t be a life coach right now. I just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do it. People are going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201271\">see right through my\u2026you know, I\u2019m not going to be able to present myself and focus and listen. I just can\u2019t. You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">[30:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">Or in the best case scenario, it\u2019s going to be like a stumbling half-assed, you know what I mean. You need some peace of mind to gather yourself together and just breathe and you know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">I was telling my mom, she should feel blessed. What a wonderful\u2026it\u2019s not ideal, but thank God that there\u2019s this option. You know. Do I want exactly that? No, but that\u2019s what there is and we have to make the best of it and capitalize on that, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like your uncle\u2019s only concerned about the money part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah, his big concern is\u2026I mean my uncle. He\u2019s not even\u2026he doesn\u2019t want to get into it, but he\u2019s really dealing with like my aunt and my cousin, they\u2019re in Provident. I think they\u2019re way more fucked than my mom and I know. And what we know is that we\u2019re\u2026the information that we know is that they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">fucked. So I can\u2019t imagine what more there is that my uncle. Just he\u2019s like, you know\u2026you know how they are. They\u2019re paranoid. They don\u2019t want me to tell anybody whatever. But he\u2019s like trust me; it\u2019s really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20130-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20130-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561750\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">[31:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">So I think, a.) Yeah, he sees like how could you squander hundreds of thousands, I mean...? That\u2019s, to him, like\u2026and I get that. I absolutely get that. And 2.) Yeah, he\u2019s like, he doesn\u2019t want us to get in to that position. But you know, I kind of tried to emphasize \u2013 and he knows that. I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201351\">I mean, we don\u2019t live a lavish life. This is very different. I\u2019m not taking every chick I meet on a cruise. I\u2019m not buying a Harley-Davidson or a yellow Corvette. I mean, you know, they\u2019re entitled. You know. They always had it and they just felt entitled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">And as it turns out, my uncle who passed to\u2026her husband was clearly the money guy. Otherwise this would have never, never. If she was my mom, this would have never happened. Not in this way. You know what I mean. Whatever my mom squandered was just, you know, it went to the house, it went to bills, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201371\">you know. But if we were like them and we had all these properties\u2026are you kidding me? Never, never. You don\u2019t just liquidate everything and just fucking\u2026you don\u2019t do that. You know, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">But yeah, no, I mean I totally understand where he\u2019s coming from. Absolutely. You can\u2019t just take that money and then just like live on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s what I was getting ready\u2026this would be liquidating it and spending it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">[33:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. And it\u2019s absolutely understandable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you get that. When push comes to shove in practice what happens, so if that doesn\u2019t happen you\u2019re just only saying that there\u2019s got to be [inaudible \u2013 33:17] or else that is what will happen. That is what would happen to anybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: If they\u2019re like [inaudible \u2013 33:23], that\u2019s the only money you\u2019ll have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah, and he wasn\u2019t at all saying it in any negative way. He was just saying it all sounds great. He says I\u2019ve just gotten very very conservative. And actually I understand. I know that he\u2019s doing very well, but he\u2019s right. He\u2019s like I\u2019m millions of dollars in debt. So it\u2019s high revenue, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201471\">it\u2019s all relative. So he\u2019s like I think about that and like any second, God forbid, if something were to happen, we are screwed. Because if that revenue\u2026yes it\u2019s coming in, but it\u2019s covering these huge\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: That amount of debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">[34:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">But yeah, no, it\u2019s like you said. Like that\u2019s exactly what it feels like right now. There\u2019s not a stable foundation right now. When money is so stressful, everything\u2019s tainted. Everything\u2019s tainted. You know, so. So what I\u2019m trying to do is just remember that, but there\u2019s a solution. It might not be <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F1\">the perfect solution, but it is a really good solution. Yet, I\u2019ll have to deal with it at some point when it comes time to pay it. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">You know what it\u2019s like? I feel like this is a second chance at that money, you know what I mean, that my mom\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">If I was who I am now then, of course we would have bought, immediately bought another house. I would have been much more in charge. Back then, even though I tried, I was like okay, mom; there\u2019s $150,000 grand left. You have to put this somewhere and forget about it. But that wasn\u2019t who I am now. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201531\">she was able to kind of, you know what I mean. So I feel like this is a second chance for me to take charge and be like okay, look; different ball game now. You know. Saving, paying off certain debts, not eating in to the money as much as possible, buying another property; more equity, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20152-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20152-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561750\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20155\">[35:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20157\">You know like we\u2019re in sync now more. My mom and I are getting each other and she\u2019s way more\u2026it\u2019s like we\u2019ve talked about it. I\u2019ve kind of trained her, or she just sees that the more and more confident and whatever I am with her. She\u2019s much more willing to defer. She\u2019s still a worry wart, but she also <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201571\">knows something has to give. You know, so. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20159\">THERAPIST: One of the tricky things about it is it could feel, for the short run, like let\u2019s say the reverse mortgage goes through and it works. It could feel like getting the foundation, but it\u2019s somewhat seductive. Because if it doesn\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s debt. And it actually; like for the time being you\u2019ll have money, but if you spend that money because something else doesn\u2019t work out, then the foundation is gone very quickly. Like quick sand. So counting on that is like the relief. That would give the foundation, I think, as a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2015D1\">bit of a fantasy. That\u2019s only a foundation if it gets put towards something else and starts making money really quickly. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2015F\">CLIENT: No I do. This is what I\u2019m saying; it\u2019s a calculated risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20161\">[37:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20163\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20165\">CLIENT: It\u2019s an absolute risk. But it\u2019s\u2026and again, the big chunk of that money wouldn\u2019t be spent. I\u2019m factoring in kind of living expenses. I\u2019ve over shooting; I\u2019m over estimating a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20167\">So let\u2019s say we even use $75,000 grand, $80,000 grand of it. Right. Well that huge other chunk is just going to be put aside in an account that\u2019s literally, like it\u2019s like a horse at the gate. Forget about it, but when the time comes, because that\u2019s how real estate is now around here. You have to just <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201671\">pound; like you can\u2019t just take your\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20169\">THERAPIST: Buy whenever. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah, because people are over bidding. Things barely hit the market and they\u2019re so\u2026but now you have this cash to be one of those people. This is exactly what I\u2019m looking for. Blah, blah, blah. Once those things are checked off, the broker knows exactly what you want, what the circumstances are; <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">cash. Done. That\u2019s a risk. What if you don\u2019t find that place? What if you find the place and there\u2019s a problem with the place? But, you know. I don\u2019t want to be like my mom where everything\u2019s a what-if. \u201cWell, if we had done some of the things we should have done that I wanted to do, whatever,\u201d what <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B2\">if? Look at what\u2019s happened, you know. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">[38:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016F\">THERAPIST: How does [inaudible \u2013 38:51] fit in to this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I guess it would be like buy another place. I mean in a way, my mind would be at ease because my mom\u2019s not stressed about money and now she\u2019s have the first floor and the third floor. So we have our house. We have all this revenue coming in, that yes, eventually is <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201711\">owed, but my mom is socking away all this money and hopefully I\u2019d be able to buy a condo before I leave. You\u2019re getting rental income from three places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">And yes \u2013 that was the other thing \u2013 my uncle\u2019s like well with the condo, what\u2019s the revenue going to be? You know. Because he\u2019s all about flipping, and I get that, because that\u2019s big money. You know. You make $40,000 grand on it and then you do something else. And then you make $100,000 on it and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201731\">do, you know. But I was like that\u2019s great. Maybe I will do that, but I\u2019m okay just making $700 a month.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20172-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20172-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561750\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20175\">I\u2019ve paid cash. Yes there\u2019s a monthly fee, the condo fee. So even if I make $700, $600, all the equity is in the condo \u2013 cash. And $600 there, $725; so that, I feel pretty damn good, you know. And then I\u2019m making money; that you pay different taxes when you work. You pay less or not, depending on whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201751\">it is.

It\u2019s an antihistamine right, Benadryl. So there\u2019s a prescription antihistamine now called Vistaril that they\u2019re prescribing as a sleep-aid only. Like that\u2019s how pervasive it\u2019s become.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well even, you know, Nyquil\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F\">THERAPIST: It has antihistamine in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Nyquil finally put something out called ZQuil. Same bottle. Same everything. I don\u2019t know that the difference is. But it\u2019s because they see how many people take Nyquil for sleep, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A3\">Actually, maybe that\u2019s what I need to do because Nyquil doesn\u2019t quit make me feel like this. It\u2019s just the sleepiness without this weird feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A5\">[43:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s probably the same exact drug, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A9\">CLIENT: Maybe. Yeah, I should check. Maybe I\u2019m just used to Nyquil or something. Yeah, no; and then I just end up sleeping. I mean I do sleep, but it\u2019s all kind of\u2026 [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just a [inaudible \u2013 44:10].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Not having enough sunshine in the daytime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B1\">CLIENT: Absolutely. Sure. [Pause.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B3\">THERAPIST: You could take the Ativan. Do you use that for sleep ever?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B5\">CLIENT: Ativan? I do every so often, but I find that it doesn\u2019t\u2026it relaxes me, but it doesn\u2019t do this.
