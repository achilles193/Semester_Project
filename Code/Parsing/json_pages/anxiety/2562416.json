But I guess I was kind of going back through the folders and try to remember exactly what I did and what was the right one to use or the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">right format, whatever. And sort of thinking it\u2019s about being organized or kind of what are some, I don\u2019t know, if I can go to grad school, and kind of being bombarded with a lot of things. And I don\u2019t know, the way to better stay organized are kind of easier on myself. And that kind of looked like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">what are some other things that I can do to kind of be on top of my, on top of things. It seemed like a really good question or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">But I guess, I don\u2019t know. Then also work. So my other boss, Pamela, she\u2019s very she only works on a few post-docs. She\u2019s not Ray (ph) is more office manager, kind of talks to everyone; she kind of monitors a few people, writes grants and travels a lot. So I very rarely speak to her. The only time <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">I speak to her is about budget or breaking things down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Anyway, so there\u2019s always talk about who\u2019s better to work with or Ray talks more, he\u2019s forward. He always wants to do more, spends a lot of money, very ambitious and kind of anything\u2019s possible. Pamela\u2019s much more practical and always talking about budget, things like that. But anyway so I always have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">these weird run-ins with her where she comes to me because I help keep the funds for the staff pools that we submit and which grant they should be charged to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">But the thing is all I really do is I hand her a piece of paper with all the staff pool needs and she\u2019s, and [inaudible at 00:05:19] who did them, and she writes the grant. Then I actually put it in Excel and send it to our grant manager. And so I\u2019m not really, all I\u2019m kind of doing is just taking what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">she writes on these papers, writing it in Excel and sending it. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m making a decision or I really have a -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I see. You\u2019re just sort of like a small step in a chain of processing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right, the shipment of time [inaudible at 00:05:48], which is mine. And she always comes to me and says why was this amount of money charged to this amount of grant? And then I show her the piece of paper with it and it\u2019s always well why is it she always blames me for and I just think whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">And then it\u2019s always left unopened. I say well can we get together with because I talk to the grant manager as well and we\u2019re always confused because we\u2019re just doing what she says and it\u2019s not very clear. I think why can\u2019t we all get together and discuss this because basically in the end me and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">other grant manager kind of say well if she said this and I said that and, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">And so again it\u2019s just kind of an uneasy feeling of this is so much money; it\u2019s not like a little bit of money. She gets angry but then she doesn\u2019t want to make it right or kind of follow through with it. I don\u2019t know. We need her input because it\u2019s coming from her. It\u2019s not like we can do everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">and I don\u2019t know how the funds work; that\u2019s not really my job or whatever. But I don\u2019t know. But I think she assumes that I do or something, that I know what all the grants are and I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562416\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">So [inaudible at 00:07:26], I don\u2019t know. So it made me think, I don\u2019 t know a lot about who, what you guys are instead of her style and what I want. Perhaps still grad school and what kind of, or what I can do to, I don\u2019t know, get more organized or get better or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So, to get this straight, so usually essentially you would get the information from her about what was being spent on what, you would put it in a spreadsheet, which is really the extent of what you do with it, and then send it to the branch manager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: And she comes to you as though you are sort of more involved or have more responsibility for how the money got spent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. Well I guess the thing is for the sample processing, there\u2019s three things that go into how much a sample costs. There\u2019s just three invoices from different companies and since I\u2019m a science person I know which invoices should be charged to the grants. So basically I just get the invoice <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">and assignments, like this is Micro Ray (ph), should be charged, and basically all that adds up. And then based on how Diana signs each sample, those three charges kind of, those then get allocated to the different grants. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">So I\u2019m just I mean basically I\u2019m just making sure that one of those invoices that come in isn\u2019t charged to, as [inaudible at 00:09:34] as my grade, isn\u2019t charged to something else because we have all these different projects. But that\u2019s the only thing where we\u2019re able to do a little more than just, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">I don\u2019t know, just putting [inaudible at 00:09:49] all together and saying oh this invoice goes to Micro Ray (ph). Again it\u2019s just me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re actually figuring out whose tab it\u2019s on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Right. So I\u2019m the catcher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And then she does two strange things. One of which is to treat you like you have more responsibility for or over some things, and the other is to not actually seem to want to clear it up or follow through, which is especially weird because it\u2019s real money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. Well she\u2019ll say why is this $45,000 charged, which is things that everyone in the office shares instead of being charged to Micro Ray (ph), and I\u2019ll say I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll talk to the grant manager. And I\u2019ll talk to her and she says that\u2019s not the case. And I say well, I don\u2019t know. [Laughs] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">And then I don\u2019t know if it ever gets cleared up. I don\u2019t want to, I mean things aren\u2019t very I go in there and say well I talked to [inaudible at 00:11:01] and she said everything\u2019s fine. And then she\u2019ll just go like this, ignore me or something; she\u2019s kind of like that. But I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">I don\u2019t know if I mean I guess this stuff is kind of stressful and, I don\u2019t know. But it always seemed like a black box in terms of how things get charged because I have no idea. But I guess Pamela\u2019s got it, handled it and she\u2019s been doing it for years so whatever. I don\u2019t worry; I try not to worry <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">about it too much only when she comes to me saying how is this system basically work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">But, yes, and then, I don\u2019t know. Talking to Tamala and just like are all hours calm like this. I don\u2019t know. And I say no, and, I don\u2019t know. Or it\u2019s kind of like a weird and uneasy feeling of I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing something wrong or I could be doing something else or better or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562416\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">I guess but there\u2019s also an upside to [inaudible at 00:12:34] because if you need something, you need to do an experiment or you need feedback on paper or something, they\u2019re on top of it and always working and, not usually money, but all their offices are good. The guy\u2019s always gone or does not have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">money to [inaudible at 00:12:57] this experiment so, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just payoffs (ph) I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t think that in terms of you being in grad school I guess partly in relation to anticipating that the office where you work in grad school might be quite different and also in terms of how you would want to sort of done things as you had a little more responsibility to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Current in some way responsibility. Unless what do I want out of the office because this is kind of, this kind of environment is kind of all I know. And it\u2019s, I think it might be I mean it\u2019s going to be hard for me to have, figure out what I want or, yes, come to grips with it. We\u2019ll see because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">I mean I can imagine when I first came to the office I was kind of unaware of, I don\u2019t know. I guess they were kind of, my bosses were very kind of, they\u2019re kind of hard to describe I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">They\u2019re not unfriendly, they\u2019re just, I don\u2019t know, very yes, they\u2019re demanding but things actually get done. Like things get published, we get money for that but it\u2019s not like the most welcoming environment or whatever. There\u2019s a lot of stress and things get done and things get out quickly. But I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">imagine other offices it\u2019s not like that at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: You like the way that your office is sort of like the big leagues. You sort of put that much into it and do it well [inaudible at 00:16:30] chance being a process that\u2019s productive and successful and well-funded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: I guess it was more of kind of, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of preparing myself I guess in terms of how to be an undergrad student in terms of figuring out what I want or kind of being able to talk to other researchers and things like that and kind of figuring out what I want instead of kind of keeping <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">my head down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s I think a little different from the way I usually hear you talk about stuff at work. I understand it\u2019s because your role will be changing, you\u2019ll be in grad school but overall I\u2019m feeling like someone\u2019s going to beat (ph) your show. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Right. I guess, I mean there\u2019s always talk of the environment in the office but whatever. I mean, I don\u2019t know, we have more grad students. When I first started there was only one grad student; now we have seven, so there\u2019s a lot of them in the office. And I think one of the reasons why is you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">get more funding if you have more grad students and I think because of cutting further we need them. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s more of a, I don\u2019t know. But because I don\u2019t think our, just the nature of our bosses, they don\u2019t like having grad students because you have to be around more, mentally more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">But yes, I mean, I\u2019m just kind of not talking to them but noticing their interactions with them and some of the [inaudible at 00:19:37] because we definitely, or after the researchers\u2019 assistant stuff I get treated differently. It\u2019s definitely because one day Pamela, we get treated she treats the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">grad students a lot better and is more interested in them. And Ray (ph) is actually nicer to us than the grad students so, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s probably because we work on call researches and work on his larger projects. So yes we\u2019re yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562416\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">I guess I was going to just, yes I have an uneasy feeling of one because I didn\u2019t, because the whole thing was Pamela, I didn\u2019t know. Or it always makes me kind of worried that something\u2019s going to pop up down the road and why was this money spent. And then I was kind of worried about how I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">to handle it if Philippa (ph) could evidently now choose a boss and they rotate through or whatever. It\u2019s kind of high pressure. In the end you can talk to people and they can give you their opinions of everyone else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Can they do it sort of the same way they do at Yale where you do rotations every couple of months or something and then after a year or so you figure out what side you want?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Exactly. But I guess if we\u2019ll do four rotations and then but there\u2019s so many offices to choose from and yes, you can talk to other grad students. There\u2019s popular ones but this is kind of what you want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s kind of what you want?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: In terms of choosing which exact topics he wants to let me know and do you want to be in on a office that the [inaudible at 00:22:24] is there or not there or there\u2019s a lot of people to review or, I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m just kind of feeling it out. Then some grad students work really closely <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">with post-docs and the same thing with the [inaudible at 00:22:58]. There\u2019s a few grad students that are sidelined. Post-docs being one aspect of the project and the grad students there all work together mostly so the offices there are mentoring and positioning [inaudible at 00:23:20].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">I guess it feels just like more decisions I guess I have to make and being very sort of wanting to kind of train or prepare myself for it and I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: First thing it feels mixed on one hand because it\u2019s sort of exciting to think that you\u2019d be able to make decisions and pick something that you want that works for you but at the same time it\u2019s kind of anxious because you\u2019ve got to figure all that out. I kind of imagine you sort of feel some <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">pressure or uncertain you don\u2019t know what would be best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just going to in the end it\u2019s about all those decisions that will come and, I don\u2019t know. People keep asking me about when I get home or will I find a place or, I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I guess yes I feel like, yes, preparation I\u2019m losing probably for training mode.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You said training mode? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes. I feel like I need to prepare, do all these things before I leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Do you know when you\u2019ll leave?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: August. So yes, I have lots of, or I have some time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: I mean you seem a little freer talking about it a little less sort of caught as you talk about the grad school stuff. And maybe as you were thinking about it yesterday, less caught in that sort of strobe light (ph) between feeling like you need to stay focused on sort of the most immediate <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">work or the things you have to do and being occupied with things that could pull you away from that. You don\u2019t seem as caught in that sort of struggle as you\u2019re talking about the stuff of grad school. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562416\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: I guess, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m thinking about grad school\u2019s not as, I mean yes I\u2019m worried a little bit but I can be more I don\u2019t know rational about it or something in terms of oh I can\u2019t sit here and worry about [inaudible at 00:32:18] offices and stuff like that. I don\u2019t know it just kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">seems like I don\u2019t want to get bared (ph) out or weirded out or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">It\u2019s not as heavy or something or thinking about, or I\u2019m not I\u2019m sort of thinking about Devin or my family or what we\u2019ll do about I don\u2019t know, about things. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if those are the feelings when you guys are not being subject to somebody else in the same way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right, I mean, I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I guess, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s right now there\u2019s a little doubt causing it or something. I\u2019m sort of just selecting (ph) what other people say about it. [Pause] I\u2019m just thinking, yes, I just sort of want to get there. Other students are getting rated (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">down or coming back and I thought [inaudible at 00:36:06] thought of something but that\u2019s okay. [Pause] So I\u2019m not really sure why it\u2019s easier to talk about my other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: You have some sense of light contrast to what you\u2019re struggling with Pamela and also I imagine how it\u2019s sometimes going to feel with me. And that school stuff is kind of it\u2019s your own thing; you can do what you want, at least as far as you know now, and how much you can be doing really yet. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">Pamela is kind of like your part of this bigger system that you\u2019re not entirely clear about and so she comes to make these kind of strange seeming [inaudible at 00:39:54] that doesn\u2019t make sense entirely. And you sort of know your piece of it but kind of not in a way because it fits in with the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200732\">things that aren\u2019t as clear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">I guess I hear too is one of the things we talk about is I bring up things like confusing or uncertain. [Pause] I don\u2019t know, it may be true but I guess when I think about it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:40:59] help for it. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. I guess I do kind of feel a shift or kind of what I think about when my mind relaxes a little bit and I focus, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well we\u2019ve talked for now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
