I had my (inaudible at 5:23).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) I got both your e-mails.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Oh, okay. (chuckles) Yeah, you responded (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: You usually don\u2019t cancel sessions because you have just other things to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I said you usually don\u2019t cancel sessions because you have other things to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. Yesterday I was just getting really overwhelmed. Everything was bothering me (chuckling). My life feels very fragmented. It\u2019s not just one giant thing taking up all my time. It\u2019s, like, little, little things, and (pause). Yeah, so, it\u2019s just like, ooh\u2014I had to finish an assignment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">It was due yesterday, and I didn\u2019t finish it. I was up until 2 on Monday night, and I couldn\u2019t finish it. I just feel like I\u2019m (sighs) not able to get a handle on things on my schedule, and all that. I\u2019m falling behind. I got an extension, but I just wanted to devote\u2014I mean, I need chunks of time for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">writing, I can\u2019t just do it on the fly. I have to sit down for several hours. Okay, my day is so fragmented. I don\u2019t get to start writing when I have therapy until noon, and I don\u2019t like that. So, days I don\u2019t have therapy I can start early. (chuckling) It just felt like it was something in the way, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">and that\u2019s why I was late. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(pause) I\u2019m canceling everything, it\u2019s not just the therapy. I\u2019m not going to class, and I have a dentist appointment that I\u2019ve been waiting for for like two months tomorrow, and I\u2019m going to cancel that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m not at all implying I\u2019m taking it personally. I understand that, with you, this feeling that you have, which you do get a lot\u2014I understand there\u2019s a practicality. You need time to write, and I don\u2019t want to minimize that. But like, where you feel overwhelmed, and you\u2019re taking on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">too much, and then you have to drop everything. And then you get worried you don\u2019t have money, so you take on a full-time job. And you feel the full-time job is too much and then you want to quit. Like, modulating or moderating can feel hard for you sometimes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know how to moderate. I didn\u2019t moderate. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Well, I can see it in the reverse. It\u2019s hard to moderate when you feel overwhelmed and flooded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) Yeah, I was feeling flooded yesterday (pause). I was just standing at my calendar, looking. Where did the time fly? What am I doing? I\u2019m trying to analyze what exactly I did last month. Because I felt much better in February. I felt\u2014I had a deadline, which was great. I was working <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">towards something, and just this one-time thing was occupying me. I think that was better for me. Now it\u2019s only, \u201cdo this, do that. Help that person, help this person.\u201d I just (chuckles), I just don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t know why, I feel overwhelmed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause) I do get that way when, like, I feel like, okay, so I was taking to a friend (ph) Therefore, I should break up (laughing). So I even feel that, it\u2019s not just with jobs. Feeling underwhelmed and getting a job, and then feeling overwhelmed and getting a job. And, so the (ph) relationships too. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">This class that I\u2019m taking, I\u2019m not\u2014I feel totally underwhelmed. I think this class was the reason I kept wanting to get a job. I was like \u201cThis is three hours of sitting here and doing nothing. Learning nothing. It took a minute to learn, like, out of three hours, there was just one minute that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">inspiring to me. That\u2019s not worth my time. I could be making money right now. Something that I don\u2019t have and desperately need. I don\u2019t know why I think that way. The cost\/benefit analysis of something. Maybe that\u2019s not abnormal, maybe everyone thinks that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562622\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean people do think that way. I think your cost\/benefit analysis tends to be in very short increments of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Like, you don\u2019t always take the big picture or the long overview of cost\/benefit. It\u2019s like cost\/benefit at the moment. Like what\u2019s the cost of going to therapy at this moment? Not, oh maybe therapy can help me with this problem of moderating myself, so that the long-term benefit actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">outweighs it. Not saying you should feel that way, but that\u2019s one way to think about it. At the moment, it\u2019s cutting up your day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Well both are true, aren\u2019t they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: They are both true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, in the sense that I do see the long-term benefit of therapy. Which is why, guess what? I\u2019ve been coming to you for two years (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like I\u2019m not acknowledging that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: No, no, no, I\u2019m acknowledging that (chuckles). I\u2019m telling myself. This is an argument I\u2019m having myself (inaudible). But, and that\u2019s also true, that it does cut up my day. Both are true and how do I make a nice decision based on both facts? Like taking both facts into consideration? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems like it\u2019s also tied with feeling overcommitted at times. Kind of bogged down by your commitments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve tried to handle that. I mean (pause) I feel bad about, like today, we don\u2019t have this class and I feel underwhelmed. It\u2019s at nights on Wednesdays. And we don\u2019t have that, but the teacher wants a 20-minute conference with every student. So, she was sending a signup sheet around. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I didn\u2019t sign up, and she was like \u201cSo you didn\u2019t sign up.\u201d And I just looked at it and looked at her, and was like, \u201cDo you come in on campus on Tuesdays?\u201d (chuckling) And she\u2019s like \u201cNo I don\u2019t,\u201d and she\u2019s like \u201cI know it\u2019s hard for you to come in for just 20 minutes to meet with me.\u201d And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">\u201cYep.\u201d (chuckles) I really, like, really violently feel against it. I sent her an e-mail last night saying my back hurts and can we do it another time? And I\u2019m not lying, I did hurt my back. I mean, it\u2019s a two-hour commute, and it makes no sense right now when I\u2019m so pressed for time. So I just really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D3\">feel oppressed, you know? To do this (laughing). So I\u2019m just not going to do it. I\u2019m a very conscientious person when it comes to education and teachers. I don\u2019t even call my professors by their first name, which is the American tradition. I call everyone \u201cprofessor\u201d and \u201cteacher\u201d and give them respect. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D4\">This was very uncharacteristic of me to talk to her like this and give her attitude. This is unprecedented. But I just feel so strongly that this class is a waste of my time (laughing) Spending two hours to see her for 20 minutes is just not worth it. I don\u2019t want to do it, so I\u2019m not going to do it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D5\">I\u2019m just surprised at myself for acting this way, but I\u2019m just like (chuckling), if I do it, I\u2019ll feel horrible the whole time (laughing). I don\u2019t like cursing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562622\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">I don\u2019t even care if she\u2019s offended (chuckles). She might be offended, but I have to do the other things, the little things that are happening. I don\u2019t know how to get out of them as easily as this. I\u2019m trying to look at the positive. I\u2019m trying to tell myself, Oh, no, this meeting. I might actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">get something out, and it\u2019ll be interesting. If only I can put aside my priorities and writing, just for a bit, and job search. If I think about it for a few hours, it\u2019ll take a giant chunk of time out of my day. But maybe I can go to campus early, and write there, and then break for the meeting, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">(inaudible at 00:15:51). I\u2019m so stressed about this, I think I\u2019m going to start crying if I don\u2019t calm down, or tell myself I have today and tomorrow to just sit and write 00:16:05}<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">It comes, this really pressing need, that I just want to toss everything out the window, and not do anything else. Because, like, that\u2019s all I want. I feel like I don\u2019t want anything else, and why isn\u2019t the world giving it to me? (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well, part of the reason the world isn\u2019t giving it to you is because you signed up for other things. And I\u2019ve seen this before, you sign up for something, and then you feel imposed upon by the very thing that you actually sought to sign up for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: I know. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not like taxes. Whether you seek it out or not, you have to pay taxes. It\u2019s not like something you were like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. So what\u2019s the solution here? (pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019ll give you an answer to what\u2019s the solution. I\u2019m not sure what this would look like, but when I hear you in these modes, I kind of\u2014and also, when you talk about having these very strong reactions to people outside, and doing things that later you regret, I kind of just want to slow <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">you down. Just a little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: How do I slow down?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Right, so that\u2019s a good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Breathe and do yoga? (laughing) I could (pause). No, I\u2019m learning. So, on Monday\u2014Monday was when I was going to brilliantly sit down, get glued to my chair, and just write. But, as soon as I left this place, I got an e-mail that was like, oh, this profile that I wrote, I did a really shitty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">job on, and the professor was so mad. So that took up until almost like 3 or 4. I told Chris (sp?) I\u2019d do yoga with him (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Speaking of yoga (chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I was like, \u201cOh, I have this huge deadline tomorrow, and it\u2019s already like 3 or 4, so I should just sit here and write.\u201d And he was like \u201cI know, yeah, but you know in these moments, I feel like an abandoned child.\u201d So I was like, \u201cOkay, alright. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d (chuckling) And then I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">didn\u2019t get back writing until 10. So (laughing) you know, that was a whole day. If I think about it, like if I stress myself out, I would just pull my hair right now, thinking, \u201cWhat? How did I do that?\u201d I\u2019m trying not to think that way, and I\u2019m telling myself, it was really important. Chris, he really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">needs to take care of his body, and he hasn\u2019t at all done it all his life. This is a good thing, helping him do this. He\u2019s helped me out so much, and I cannot be an intellectual match for him, but at least in other superficial areas. Perhaps I think they\u2019re important and he might not think they\u2019re important <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200553\">right now. I should do this. And it\u2019s good for me too, so, you know. (pause) This is one way that I\u2019m slowing down <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562622\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">Lies (ph) I don\u2019t think that about going to meet this professor for 20 minutes. I mean, I think I would get something out, but just the two hours of commute would mean that...it\u2019s a giant chunk of time out of my day, so (pause) I cannot think as nicely about it as I did for video project (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: Did you feel like you couldn\u2019t be honest with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: I mean she knows, she said it herself, right? Come and see me for 20 minutes, is, you know, whatever, I don\u2019t know what she said. But yeah, it is! (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s not only that, but it\u2019s different than you\u2019re not going to be on campus, and it takes a long time to commute there. Maybe not everybody is commuting that far just to see her for 20 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, but I am\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Right, but it didn\u2019t seem like you felt you could tell her that. Like actually, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be over two hours for this 20 minute meeting. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work for me. I really appreciate your time, though. Maybe we could find a time where I\u2019m going to be on campus, anyway.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">It didn\u2019t seem like you felt like you could be that direct with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">It seems like a reasonable position, to not want to commute that far. I don\u2019t know what the norms are around professors and their request of your time, but it seems pretty reasonable not to want to commute that far for such a short meeting. She wouldn\u2019t necessarily have known that you weren\u2019t on campus <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">or that it takes you that long to get there, but it seems like you felt you couldn\u2019t be direct with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Well, I think I felt that she knew. Because she said that, \u201cI know coming for only 20 minutes doesn\u2019t seem to make sense,\u201d or something. So she must have known I only come to campus for that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Maybe, I don\u2019t know. Maybe<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve already made up my mind not to go to the next two classes. So... (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: They\u2019re just workshops and people are workshopping poetry. And it\u2019s like, super underwhelming for me. It\u2019s super underwhelming. The whole time I\u2019m trying to text, or just on my phone. (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So this is part of a bigger problem. You\u2019re feeling like she\u2019s wasting your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Mmhmm. I mean, I\u2019m not like personally. I can totally understand the structure of the class, and this and that. It\u2019s just not a good fit for me, you know? And I took this class thinking, it\u2019s a poetry class. I was thinking, I write poetic prose anyway. This will help me to think in that area. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">I\u2019ve never written poetry so I thought it would be challenging. And it was mildly challenging, but not as much as I thought it was. It\u2019s geared more towards undergraduates, and stuff. This is all, even in the larger scheme of things, feeling somewhat underwhelmed by various things at Amherst because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">it\u2019s just not\u2014like the intellectual quotient of the classes there are just not the same caliber as at Columbia, which was the best for me. And then, after Columbia, you have lower MSU. And then even lower, Amherst. (laughing) So it\u2019s like I\u2019m climbing down (laughing). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562622\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: And which speaks to the initial issue I raised, is that you chose to do a degree in that you feel is useful in some ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s very, very different. Like there\u2019s much more practical knowledge. It\u2019s really actually helped me to be a writer, which is what I wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: I\u2019m actually talking to this girl who\u2019s kind of the same position as me. She got into both MSU and Amherst, so I talked to her for an hour, telling her how both my experiences were. But, like, it\u2019s a three-year program, and even if I have a job or not\u2014I should just talk about myself, not (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">at 00:24:43). Yeah, so this was a three-year commitment, which is a lot. So that\u2019s overwhelming in that sense. It might be underwhelming in its direct instruction, but the three-year time period is overwhelming. To be poor for that long and thinking that it\u2019s not just the degree I\u2019m pursuing, it\u2019s the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200792\">craft. It\u2019s the mindset that I have to cultivate, of trying to be a writer. I\u2019m supposed to do that, I feel, at least for that long, and develop, or like, cultivate this community that I\u2019m part of to students and teachers. The habit of meeting deadlines, the habit of once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200793\">done. You have to revise and think about that, and meet with the teachers to think to make a plan for revision. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">(Pause) And just on my own time, thinking how to manage money, and how to manage writing. Which, apparently number one has a straight answer. Even my professors, who are like 60 and 70, they struggle with this, too, managing time. Everyone struggles with that (chuckling) and that\u2019s something that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">learning, and I\u2019m not at all succeeding at managing. Then I\u2019m also told no one succeeds at it, so (chuckling), it\u2019s like a leaky process of failings (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">So all this, I think I just didn\u2019t learn at MSU. It was like school, it was like grad school. You were just doing the work, because it\u2019s so short and quick, and so many classes packed in, like four classes a semester. You just don\u2019t have time for anything else. Amherst felt more real in that sense. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">I took this class because I thought I\u2019d be working very intensely on my novel, which I did up until February. And it seemed slightly easy because it\u2019s poetry, in the sense that it would have a lot less reading. It wasn\u2019t like reading a novel a week, which is what I think I should have taken (chuckling). <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D2\">I\u2019m much better at that. I feel the right amount of (overlapping voices at 00:27:19) pressure in a literature class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">Every Wednesday it\u2019s been tough. I didn\u2019t go last week. I got so much done. I actually got stuff done. I\u2019m so happy. (laughing) It was like three hours, and even longer. I got ready, and I picked up my bag, and I set my alarm clock (ph). And I go in, and I have this thing to do, that thing to do. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">said, just don\u2019t go! Just don\u2019t do it. I said, \u201cReally, I can do that?\u201d I put my bag down, and took my things off, and shut the door. I started working. Finally (ph) nice to rebel. (laughing) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">The teacher can spend hours, like an hour and a half on this short poem. And I\u2019m just like\u2014I\u2019m so bored. And asking really obvious questions (laughing). It makes me want to pull my hair out (laughing). I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t be Zen about it. I\u2019ve tried.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562622\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">I think I am just like that. I want to do what I want to do, and if I don\u2019t get to do that, I just get really upset (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well you feel trapped very easily. And so, there are things you do that are not top of your list. It\u2019s not like you live this sort of hedonistic life, and that\u2019s it. When you feel sort of imposed upon or trapped, that\u2019s when it\u2019s very hard for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that everyone deals with that emotion in a much better way than I do. Even Chris, who really feels this way, you know? Trapped. But even he wouldn\u2019t do any of the crazy, drastic, dramatic things that I do. Such as breaking up with a person that you feel trapped by (laughing). <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">Like basically breaking up, right? That sums it up. Quitting a job is like breaking up, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: Getting away from...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, just running away. Not running, maybe. Yeah, running away slash breaking that bond, connection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">(Pause) It shouldn\u2019t lead to that, right? Like, it doesn\u2019t make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: Just because I\u2019m bored in someone\u2019s class, doesn\u2019t mean I should hate them and never want to see them again, right? (laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: The two aren\u2019t necessarily the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah (pause). But with my job, I feel that could be one way of looking at it. Or maybe there\u2019s another way of looking at it that I stay with them for at least a year, and then my last job at least two years. Three years, actually, yeah. Two (laughing). I don\u2019t know, two or three. But I stayed <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">until I could just not take it anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">I mean it is good to have this kind of pressing need to write, this motivation or whatever you want to call it. Because if it wasn\u2019t strong, I wouldn\u2019t do it. There are so many talented who want to do unusual things, but they just don\u2019t have this kind of fire under their asses, they just don\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: You clearly stick things out. I mean, you\u2019ve gotten the degrees you\u2019ve gotten. It\u2019s not like you leave after the first week of a program. You stick things out. You stick relationships out. You stick things out. You\u2019ve had jobs. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re incapable of doing it, nor is it that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s simply that there are times that the intensity of the feelings you\u2019re dealing with all the time, and maybe sometimes not making the best decision about leaving too quickly. Or maybe just believing wrongly, in a sense. I don\u2019t mean to be judgmental, but feeling like you need to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200992\">out of there, versus just sort of leaving and moving on with a little more grace, which you have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah! Like telling the professor, yes, actually, when she said whatever she said, and I thought I was making her feel bad instead of feeling that way I would have said, you know, \u201cYes, you\u2019re right professor. It takes me two hours, actually, and really I cannot do this right now, at this <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">time, this semester. So could we work something else out?\u201d (laughing) Being more graceful about it, you know? Instead of panicking and hitting whatever panic button I can reach for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Right, it\u2019s the panic, it\u2019s the feelings. It\u2019s not simply that you\u2019re doing something wrong, it\u2019s that the intensity of the feelings that you have, feeling panicked or trapped, or you\u2019ve got to get out of here. Feeling forced. What is she going to do? Come to your house and hold a gun to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">your head and make you come (inaudible due to CLIENT\u2019s laughter at 00:33:56)?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562622\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: It does feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I know, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like she\u2019s holding a gun to my head. Like, \u201csit here until 9:30 p.m.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: I know, well, in part because you see people as having power over you that they don\u2019t have. Some people have influence, like you have a boss, they could fire you. It\u2019s not like no one has any influence over you. But you do see people as having power over you that they don\u2019t necessarily have. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">They can\u2019t make you come somewhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: And even when they do, how do I act with grace? Like this one time, Nelson (sp?) was so insistent. It was Friday, and again, same situation. I had stuff to write and I hadn\u2019t got to it until like 3, 4 p.m. in the evening. I was having\u2014yeah, I just didn\u2019t even start my day until then. I was having <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A71\">lunch, and it went on for a while. And the friend just seemed to be like (mimicking friend in a high-pitched voice, inaudible words at first) let\u2019s walk around! And I was looking at my phone, like, \u201cGod\u201d I was having a good time, but you know, feeling the pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">Then as soon as I got home, Nelson got there and was like \u201cNope, come with me, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d And I felt forced, you know? Like you\u2019re holding a gun to my head. And it was terrible for the first half-hour or an hour. Sat in one corner of his place and just cried. And then, somehow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A91\">I don\u2019t know how, I calmed down, and from five to like eight, I was able to focus and it was very sweet. It was like, yes (chuckling). I don\u2019t know what changed here, but this feels awesome. I was able to release some pressure and focus, you know? (laughing) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">So I can do it, it\u2019s happened (ph), yeah (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What do you think helped you to do it in that situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: I have no idea. I cried, I think that helped, actually. I was just fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting, and then I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so I burst. And then, it was just me and my computer, and my work, and I was just like, \u201cOkay, one word at a time.\u201d And before I knew it, it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">8 (pause). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">It doesn\u2019t happen with everything. It doesn\u2019t happen in the class, for example, because it\u2019s not as interesting as my work to me. It really does just have to be like, every five minutes I\u2019m looking at my phone (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Well, aside from the particular issues that we\u2019re talking about, about feeling trapped. And I think about, is you\u2019re feeling suffocated, too. In general, you just feel things really intensely, which is not a bad thing. There\u2019s definitely many benefits to it, and it probably really enhances <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B31\">your writing a great deal. The question is, how can you manage it so that it doesn\u2019t interfere with things? And it\u2019s sort of natural when you feel something intensely. Our feelings are there to guide us to do something. A tiger is chasing us in the forest and we\u2019re like, oh, that\u2019s so interesting. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B32\">could die, so our feelings are there to inform us and cause us to act. It\u2019s kind of like an evolutionarily good things. In some situations, it could cause you to act sort of prematurely. And that\u2019s what you face a lot of the time. You sort of feel this imminent danger and you need to do something. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B33\">hard to sort of just take a step, calm down, cry. Do whatever you need to do to figure it out. There\u2019s no tiger chasing you down. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562622\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">CLIENT: I get so (ph) I guess worried about, in terms of really big decisions that actually involve feelings, and in my case I really don\u2019t know what I was feeling (ph). Whether it\u2019s job, or something very practical, it\u2019s all about feelings (chuckling). Like which job do I take on, if I do end up getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B51\">some offer from somewhere. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll happen, but I don\u2019t really go by feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the feelings that are the problem, it\u2019s the urgency sometimes. That you feel that you need to act.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, like Chris was saying last night, \u201cokay, in the summer, I will formally break up with you. And then, I\u2019ll start dating other people while your underwear\u2019s still in my drawers, you know?\u201d (laughing) So I was like, okay (laughing). It was funny, so weird. And then, soon after, he said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B91\">while we were walking back from the store. Nelson called and he was like, \u201cYeah, no, I want to wait (ph).\u201d Then I walked back to Chris, and then I was like \u201cDon\u2019t break up with me!\u201d Feeling this panic. I couldn\u2019t breathe, I felt like I was going to throw up. Like, panicking, you know? I said, \u201cdon\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B92\">break up with me,\u201d this and that. \u201cDate other people, but still need me. Call me\u201d (laughing). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">I don\u2019t know why, but, like, yeah, I just felt that panic, you know? And didn\u2019t want to rationalize, or think, or slow down. Yeah (pause). There\u2019s no other way I feel like I could take decisions, except to gauge the intensity of my feelings. Or not even gauge. Just respond to that, or react.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">THERAPIST: But you don\u2019t do that in all cases. You\u2019re not chronically acting rashly. You do that sometimes. But you don\u2019t revamp your life from week to week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">CLIENT Yeah (pause). Yeah, there is surprisingly some kind of stability in my life (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s actually a lot of stability in your life. It doesn\u2019t feel that way, but it certainly looks like that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: Like a three-year program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019re in your third degree. You completed, not including your undergraduate, you\u2019re in your third degree. The two you completed, and you\u2019re in the process of it. Your relationship with Chris I know is very back and forth, but you\u2019ve been with him for quite some time. I think it\u2019s much <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C51\">more of a feeling than it is\u2014like you have periods where you\u2019re sort of running off last minute to Ohio. But there\u2019s a lot of stability in your life, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C7\">CLIENT: And now it\u2019s alright (ph) that\u2019s becoming stable (chuckling). Which is weird (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">THERAPIST: You have a hard time feeling settled internally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe I don\u2019t want to feel settled. It might mean something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Mmhmm. What do you think it might mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: Permanence, or, I don\u2019t know.

The best I can do is, it\u2019s like the sensation, and maybe the sensation is also a temporary thing. It\u2019s not permanent. Like the sensation of saying this, and knowing...I feel that way about my project, and it\u2019s happened very recently (laughing). Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D31\">it\u2019s happened, but it just wasn\u2019t a nebulus. It was a bunch of dark clouds I was gathering and hanging for like two years. And now that it\u2019s in physical form in front of me, it has very real structure and stuff. And I\u2019ve been looking at it and saying this, okay, this, this. Day to day to day. That feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D32\">settled (chuckling). Intermittently (ph) settled. I mean it\u2019s still temporary, because this will be that. I will be able to see it from my rear-view mirror. And there will be something else that will be this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Okay Cecelia, I think we need to stop for today. So, you had e-mailed me about Monday. Are you still wanting to cancel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have a thing at 11 (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Do you want to find another time to meet that week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: Um, okay. So I don\u2019t know, because like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s up to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT I\u2019m meeting you on Wednesday, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yep. Mmhmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: And then again, on Thursday and Friday I have something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So, okay. So you want to cancel next Monday. The following week is the week where I\u2019m not here that Monday. I could meet that Thursday if you want. Would you like to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Sure, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">THERAPIST: We talked about that. I have a 10:15 available that Thursday. Okay, so I\u2019m going to see you next Wednesday, and then again the following Wednesday and Thursday, and then back to the regular schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">CLIENT: Okay, sounds good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Okay, very good. If you have something different, please let me know. I didn\u2019t get who\u2019s paying for February, do you have a payment (ph) for February? I certainly don\u2019t want to double charge you for that month. Let me take a look. My books are usually pretty up to date, but that certainly <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED1\">doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t make mistakes (pause). The last time you made a check, you made it, I think... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I paid for February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: You did, because usually...did you make it the beginning of March?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: No, in the middle of February. No, okay, maybe not. It says December\/Jan copay. 180.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, so I think that was for December and January. I don\u2019t think that was for February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: Okay, so (pause).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: If you want to pay me for March, that\u2019s fine. Usually I just ask for the payment at the end of the following month. So technically March isn\u2019t due until the end of this month. If you want to pay me for February and March, that\u2019s fine. If you want to pay just for February, that\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, what\u2019s the month (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I think for both months, it\u2019s $130 for both months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Okay, so today is the 10th, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: 9th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: $130?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: $130, mmhmm. And that\u2019s through the end of March (pause at 00:48:39). I\u2019ll put that in paid for March.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Thank you. Okay, take care Cecelia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: You too. Bye, have a good weekend (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Bye-bye. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
