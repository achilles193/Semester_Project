Coffee's a thing. It's in... I used to think it was like very particular to my dad's family. But I've noticed it... Like the guys at Christian's (ph), they're always... It's some kind of... And I'm like that too. Because I'm not going to finish this. I'm going to toss it and I'm going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">to get another one. Like it's just a... And even then... Or a store or whatever. If I go to work or whatever, generally, I get that one coffee and I generally don't finish... It's just like a... I mean, it's good. That way I'm not drinking several cups of coffee a day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But it's like a... (PAUSE) I don't know what that is.

I don't think it would really be that different to be honest with you. It's just there are plenty of times when I don't have it and I'm...

It's like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: But even if, you know... People have smoke or chew gum or...

Yeah, yeah. No. I thought about that. That way when you're talking or when I'm talking, I can kind of like go to the coffee and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Exactly. Something else to attend to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: ...distract you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wonder if that's why my dad drank, my dad's side, maybe that's why they, they have such a good attitude but maybe that's part of it. The coffee helps them to kind of stay more aloof or whatever. And same with these guys actually. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">I don't know. But it's something. I'm sure it has something to do with something. Yeah. (PAUSE) Well, and in that regard, my mom's side should have more coffee. (LAUGHTER) They don't have it at all. You know? And it's like they should probably do something, have something like that to take their mind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">off their misery. (PAUSE) And, as a matter of fact, while my aunt's here, I do notice... Because then they do have coffee. Now there's three of them. So they'll make Assyrian coffee. It's kind of like espresso, you know, whatever. And I notice that that's nice. It adds, you know... There's something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">to that, you know, having this like... It's not really dinner. It's not... So it's not stressful. It's not making all this shit. It's just, you know, a cup of coffee with a cookie or whatever. I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560790\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I think it's... (PAUSE) But so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: You know, when you think about two people who say, \"Let's meet for coffee.\" They're meeting...

Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: ...that they're meeting about and for.

I think I'm just going back to your word security blanket. Like it makes it safer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I don't think just for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.

(PAUSE) Yeah. So... I don't know. So Uma (ph) is coming tomorrow to visit which kind of... (SIGH) She kind of just reserved a room and she's coming tomorrow. It's kind of annoying a little bit. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You don't want her to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, we were playing it by ear and she just booked a room.

I mean, I'm not a sports fanatic but I'm a local kid. Like to go to the World... I don't want to watch it with some chick from... I mean, I'm going to want to watch it with my friends.

Yeah. I can't tell anymore. I'm all over the place. I'm talking to some chicks in San Diego. I might want to go see...

That's the other thing. Exactly. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It started off being she's healthy, seems normal, cool... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, but on the other hand, I think some of it is I've become much more of a realist. I've been... Like what's going to happen? I'm not going to go... What? How is this going to work? You know what I mean? You have to really spend time with someone to get serious with them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">Right? So that's one. So that's a lot of fucking effort back and forth. But, two, then what? So it's going to be another one of those things where someone has to move for somebody and... You know? Like I... That's... I'm not... That's... I might go to Assyria to teach. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking of that.

They're also in that, like, \"Yeah, let's move to Europe.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">There's a little more... (PAUSE) It's just... It's San Diego. You know? There's a lot more of that feel in San Diego where people are living much more unconventional kind of lives. You know? (PAUSE) I don't know. I have no idea. But... Yeah. I've gotten very self... Last night there was a chick. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">wanted me to just like come over. And I didn't. I really wanted to. But I was catching myself. I was like... I just got out of practice. I had a beer. I'm hungry. It's already like eleven. I was like, \"Alright. Let me eat something and see how I feel.\" And I knew. I knew that once I ate something and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B2\">kind of took a breath... I don't want to go to someone... What? No. You know?

Yeah, the woman thing is... It's really floated up, you know, as other things have gotten sorted out. That's floated to the top as being the fucking Achilles heel of... You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:11:51) smothering and critical.

And also it's just hitting me more. When you're more lucid, things hit you more. So I'm like, \"Fuck.\" Like, are you kidding? I haven't had one? I've had lots of relationships but not... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">I can't look back on one and be like, \"Wow. That was such a kind of... That had a normal rhythm to it or something. There was a rhythm.\" None of them had fucking rhythm. They were either like intensely passionate things that then tried to be relationships for like six months or a year or whatever... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">Like that's... That's crazy. You know? And then I started feeling... That's the thing. Then I feel more frustrated. I feel like Darien is not the kind of... For the kind of woman I want, Darien is not that place. Those women aren't here as much. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560790\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">So that's frustrating as well because that ties into like, well, I don't have the money to like hop down to San Diego every single weekend or whatever.

And there's also the exit strategy of getting out soon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">Like going to Assyria. I mean, I know that's not what it is consciously for you. But I think the very thing that could play out over there is what happens in here. What are the fears (inaudible at 00:14:19) and do you get hurt there? Do you get criticized? Do you get revealed in some way that's going <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">to be humiliating the way your mother would humiliate you that could make kind of like the very thing about commitment and actually getting into something with a woman play out here in a way too. You're in but you're not really. You know? One foot in, one foot out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don't feel that. But yeah. With relationships, definitely. There's no question. I mean, I'm not like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">That's the thing, right? I'm not blaming... I don't blame Michelle (ph). I don't blame Samantha (ph). Like when you take full accountability of your share, that's... That's... I'm like, \"Well, yeah. Fuck.\" You know? I'm clearly kind of not capable in a way. You know what I mean? If I had just done a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">couple of things a little bit differently, any one of those girls I'd still be dating or even married to. Like I'm... Samantha I'm not sure because she was so aloof from the get go. But even with her, I mean, we did do relationship... I mean, in some ways, that was the most comforting moments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">You know, she'd make soup. You know, like we'd just sit and... You know, like... You know, that's... What am I trying to say? Yeah. Like now I see that was me too. Like if I just... If it was me now, I'd either not be with those people or, if I was with those people, I'd see different signs very clearly. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">Like I would have been like, \"Something's going on with Samantha. It's not me. It's... You know, something may either be off or...\" I'm not going to act all in love with her. You know what I mean? (inaudible at 00:16:41) You know what I mean? And... (PAUSE) So yeah. So like that's a bummer too. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B12\">know what I mean? Or... That's what I keep bringing up with Meredith (ph), the ultimate, I mean, someone who clearly wanted to like get married and, I mean, like clearly. So... And made sacrifices for that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560790\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">So that's, that's fucking... That's a bummer. That really brings... That makes me really sad. Because then if it didn't work out later, it could have not worked out in a way that things don't work out sometimes instead of just this typical kind of... (PAUSE) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Instead of what? What's your (inaudible at 00:17:27)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Well, it's like a super nova. Like these things, they start like a supernova, they end like a... You know what I mean? They start with these crazy passionate romantic kind of things and that's kind of how they end with really not much discussion. I haven't had any discussion with any of these <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">people really. And other than Meredith, you know, some like embarrassment and feeling humiliated, confused, and angry and all that shit. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: You're saying other than Meredith. That's not how it ended with Meredith.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Well, with Meredith, I was the one...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: You know, she didn't want that to happen. And I... There was no... I just bought a ticket here for Christmas...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: ...and I left her there and I came home. You know? But that too is a... There are all these kind of like abrupt, just messy... Like that's not me. You know, in those moments, that's... Whether it's me doing the leaving or me feeling...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Or you're feeling left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: ...yeah, left or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: It's like that's... (PAUSE) But, in both cases, that's on me. Right? With Samantha, all that bad shit happened because, you know, I wasn't needy. I was just needing what's normal in a relationship. But if someone's your girlfriend or boyfriend... But I wasn't stopping myself. That's great if <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">that's what I want but that's not what's happening here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">So I'm not going to like push it, you know, I mean, too much. I'm not going to buy her flowers and she doesn't like surprises or what the fuck. I'm just not going to do anything. You know... You know what I mean? What I would do now. You know? And same with Michelle... Like I went to the bar where she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">works because she had taken me there one time and then the last time I went, it's like... And it's not about fault or not. It's just not seeing clearly. You know, and in all those cases I didn't do anything wrong. I mean, they were definitely being assholes in those cases. It's just... I just wish I... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF2\">You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: What do you wish you had seen with Michelle, for example? What do you see (inaudible at 00:19:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Oh. That I was right to break up with her. I was the one that broke up with here. Right? And I should have just stuck with that. That's what I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Instead of coming back to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because then what happened was, you know, I'm like, \"Oh, I'm not going to find someone as beautiful as her. She's so fucking gorgeous and...\" That happened. You look around you and like, yeah, I'm not going to... Dating's hard. You know what I mean? So you trick yourself into... Especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">if you're someone who's sensitive and putting yourself down and all that shit. Right? And same with Samantha. Right? I was the one a couple times who was like, \"Yeah, you know what? I'm going to go.\" And then she's sorry and this and that and then... Right? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560790\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: So with at least the two of them, the regret is not trusting your own (inaudible) more (inaudible at 00:20:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Well, no. With all of them it is. With Meredith too. Right? I should have trusted that, wait a minute, fucking love this girl. What am I talking about? I meet this girl randomly. We have like... I mean, this is what people later tell as their story. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">Just randomly met her, a few months later she gives up her plans and moves to England for me. Like that's amazing. That's what I should have trusted, that there's something there worth...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: So trusting both...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: ...but both because (inaudible at 00:21:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. We're not having sex... I mean, when I think about it, it's like a lot of people don't have sex for a long period of time. But I was so... I was so used to the opposite that... And because I wasn't who I am now, that that immediately was like, \"Oh, she's so beautiful. See? I knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">it. She's so beautiful and she's young and she's probably like, 'What the fuck am I doing?' all that shit.\" And without stopping to think, \"Well no one's... She could just go back to...\" I mean, she's not a fucking prisoner here. She came all the way around the world to be here. That's... You know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E72\">Like that didn't even compute. Because she wasn't... She was going through some stuff and I just forgot about all that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">You know? I just... It's kind of childish. You know? It's like... (PAUSE) Or not childish but just you're seeing things through a fog. You're not seeing them... You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Or seeing things absorbed in your own anxiety about yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. You're projecting. Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: And sex (inaudible t 00:22:29) had been a bump in the road that you'd have to deal with with her but you were so used to that at the time being a thing that proved someone loved you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, with her, it was especially tricky. I think it would have been maybe different if in the beginning, the sex was totally there and then... You know? But it was never really there. So... But, again, I didn't stop to think that that's because she has... I mean, she could <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">be with whoever she wants. A girl like that could be... I mean, any girl... I mean, even the ugliest girl could be with whoever she wants for the most part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">This girl... People like... She could definitely be with whoever she wants. So... You know what I mean. Like I didn't stop to (inaudible at 00:23:11) that shit out. And also, I could have been like, \"Yeah, she's young. So, in a way, I should be the one...\" I mean, that was probably part of the attraction. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">I mean, she probably, I think, liked feeling kind of taken care of or just kind of like \"this guy knows what he's doing, he's passionate about these things and he's doing them,\" like, you know... You know? So I didn't stop to think, \"You know, she's 24...\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:23:45)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: But she was admiring you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

With everything else, I do what I set my mind to. Right? This, writing, music, getting into this <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201051\">shit back school, whatever, graduate school... Like I tend to see those things... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">I feel like I'm pretty good at manifesting things that I'm absolutely just like fucking focused on. You know what I mean? When it comes to women, I thought I was because it was just based on looks. And so that was true. I was making it, you know... Yeah. I was dating a lot of really cute girls. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">now I'm realizing, I've never stopped to be like, \"Okay. What exactly do I...\" It's funny. Like I've never asked myself...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: What exactly...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">CLIENT: Like what do I want? Like what kind of woman do I want to have? You know what I mean? I've never done that really. And now that I am, that's why I'm like, \"Darien? I don't know if Darien's good for that.\" You know? Like if I was to get really, really like married or whatever, it would be cool <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">if like she had an EU passport or... You know? Like I want something way more dynamic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">And... It's not impossible to find here but there would have to be some fucking academic type. You know what I mean? (PAUSE) That's why I like Vancouver. You know, I like that idea of (PAUSE) you know, just a much more dynamic...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: A more wordly...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Darien's provincial. And that's what I love about it. I love that it's... I get in my car and I drive down cute little streets and I come to see you and now I go to some other cute street and I see my friend. I mean, this is ridiculous. It's like a little... We're living in a little fantasy <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">land here, in terms of the US. Right? And it's great. But it's not so great if that's the kind of romantic relationship you want unless you're going to be with some pretentious douche. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">So, again, that's why San Diego is a little bit better.

I really have had no choice this whole time. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">the PhD has to get done, my book has to get... There's no other way for me. I can't... If that's what I want, just for me at least, there's no other way. I mean, the music as well... The music's there. I mean, I don't... But in terms of really solidifying the ingredients I would need to...

I'm being a life coach. You know? I'm getting better and better at when I wake up in the morning, how can, what kind of days do I want to inhabit? And this is much better. Everything's much...

I mean someone you actually (inaudible at 00:32:01)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">CLIENT: Oh, if I was like falling in love with someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">CLIENT: Well... But even there, I think just... Well, I might but now I know... Now I know. That's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">THERAPIST: I'm sure there are people who bore you and that's why you're not interested. That's probably a majority actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">THERAPIST: And yet there's still maybe something about the woman who's hard to get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. No. I'm not discounting any of this. I'm just saying it kind of feels good to not just beat myself up and say, \"With Valerie (ph) I could...\" No Valerie was boring and she annoyed me. She talked too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: That's as much what you're talking about as actually the more you're getting to know your own mind, you get to look back on some of these relationships. That's why some of them you start of saying all the regret but when you actually say what would have happened had you known yourself better, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">it would have ended earlier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: That's actually what's, the regret, not that the relationship didn't work out...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: ...not everyone...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20152-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20152-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560790\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. You could even say with Meredith, even though I feel sad, it wouldn't have even gotten that far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: Exactly. Who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: When I met her here... No. It wouldn't have. You're right. It wouldn't have. Because those first few, they were hard. She was hard on me. She wasn't meaning to be. She just was. That's because she was... Again, she was going through some shit. If it was now, I'd be like, \"Yeah...\" You know? <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201591\">This has to be a little more... The difference with her though was she was always calling and texting and... So she wasn't being aloof. But... Yeah. I think I would have been, \"Eh... This chick's 24. I don't know.\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: I mean, in a way with her, you're saying there was actually the most potential of anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">THERAPIST: And who knows what would, if you could deal with that in a different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: But also the point is you don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: You might have gotten tired of her earlier on...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: Very true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: ...and said, or said, \"Why is she willing to move with me after so little time? What's up with her?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: Very true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">THERAPIST: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">CLIENT: Very true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">THERAPIST: I mean, there's so much...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">THERAPIST: ...uncertainty about how this would have played out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: And I think part of it is you're actually getting pickier now, in a way, about what actually works for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">CLIENT: Right, right, right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah, no. It's like... It's like now I have the... I get it now. I need someone who has some profession they're really into, you know, and who's much more cosmopolitan, worldly person. You know? Darien tricks you. See? Darien's tricky with that. You meet <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D1\">a lot of girls who... They kind of dress the part. They, yeah, they have some job that's kind of interesting. But, at the end of that day, their mom and dad live in Weymouth (ph). You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">Like... That's awesome. There's nothing wrong with that. I just haven't found one of those girls yet to be like, whoa, I just want to talk to this girl and like, you know... And I want to cancel practice to be with this girl. You know? No. I... I'd rather be at home with my cat or whatever. So that's... <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F1\">You know what I mean? (PAUSE) On the other side of that, I also know that the kind of girl I'm describing is usually more of a problem. (LAUGHTER) So I get it. You know? But... (PAUSE) But then, you know, I'm a problem. You know what I mean? I'm not an easy boyfriend, I'm sure. I'm... Not as a bad guy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F2\">But it's hard to get to know me and, you know, like... So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">THERAPIST: I think I've actually heard you change quite a bit over the last year or so in you're starting to say at least out loud, even if it's not totally transparent that you want her, whoever she is, to be less aloof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">THERAPIST: You don't want to be playing like a guessing game about is her heart there or not. And actually the direct indication, the checking in, the texts, the being there has actually felt good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">THERAPIST: It's not... It doesn't feel as exciting anymore to have her be like there one day and gone the next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because now I don't care. I can be gone too. I can play that... You know, I've learned now how to do all that shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2018C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560790\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">THERAPIST: You've learned but you're always saying you're tired (inaudible at 00:36:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">CLIENT: That's what I'm saying.

Just, in general... Why don't I go to poetry readings? Because they're shitty poets acting like they're not shitty poets. Why do I not go to a lot of shows? Because the music sucks and they think they're so cool. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">You know, and those people are out there, these kind... I mean, obviously I have a band that's full of those people. I know... You know? It's just you've got to... It's about being a little more picky and seeing those differences, you know, instead of getting sucked in by the girl with the certain look <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201971\">and the... And it's hard. I mean, we all... Guys... We're kind of dumb. You know, I'm not the only one. One of my guy friends, he can't help it. He just gets drawn into so a certain allure, a certain whatever. And that's fine. You can say someone's attractive...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">CLIENT: ...or even have a, hook up with them. But as long as you know what's what. That's the difference. You know, in the past... See, in the past, I should have been, \"Shit. I just hooked up with Samantha.\" Like I should have been more like a guy in the past about these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">Like, \"Shit. Fucking beautiful.\" But instead, I immediately just, you know, just blood everywhere, heart out there... You know? Same with Michelle, same... It should have just been more like, \"Damn right. That's what I'm talking about.\" You know? And just go from there and if it's something, it is. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D1\">If it isn't, what an awesome just another chalk it up. You know? But I didn't do that.
