I've just been \u2013 I finally feel kind of better, but now I just feel like I have a cold, kind of. But it was fucking brutal. I just was so \u2013 and even now, I'm just tired.

I just zoned out from everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That's what I wondered is that I know you've even had to be out sick, or have missed, but you usually have called me recently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: The fact that you didn't call, I assumed \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: I know, I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: I wonder what that's about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I literally checked out from everything. I think I just shut down, kind of. I literally slept for a day or something. I just was \u2013 I don't know. I think I mentally kind of shut down, too. I just kind of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Did it cross your mind, or did you \u2013 was it \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: \u2013 even on your mind? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: No, no, it was totally on my mind, but yeah. I mean, I owed you a phone call. There was a couple of other things, and I was \u2013 I don't know. I was just \u2013 I just couldn't. I just shut down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Why? Do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I don't know. I just shut down. I just felt exhausted, and I just, I didn't even feel motivated to pick up the phone to \u2013 I don't know, it's kind of stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well, I mean, you could be really so sick that you can't pick up the phone, but usually with bronchitis, it wouldn't be at that level that you couldn't just call and cancel something. So that's why I wonder if there was something \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Well, it wasn't physically \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Emotional \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Like I said, that's why I'm saying I mentally shut down, too. I just kind of just \u2013 I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It sounds like pulling back to being avoidant almost for a day or maybe more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: I don't know if it was just a day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, no def, that Monday, I just, I was on lockdown.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: And that's why \u2013 what would pull you there? Was being sick pulling you into \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I think it \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: \u2013 away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Triggered it, but I think, yeah, I just felt exhausted so I think I felt mentally exhausted, too, so I think I just didn't want to just deal at all. For one day, I just didn't want to \u2013 I don't know. Yeah, and obviously I was physically able to make a phone call. But yeah, I just \u2013 I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B1\">Yeah, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And it would take you a minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: I know.

Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Mm\u2013hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Feeling like, oh, yeah, I'm in therapy, and maybe that's what it \u2013 I just wanted to not deal with any of that stuff. Work, nothing. Yeah, I don't know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: It's almost then like, shutting out your current reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Not having to be in it for a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For some reason, I felt like I just somehow mentally, I just needed to be totally checked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Because even once you make the phone call, you're back in reality, back reminded, oh, I'm not making the appointment. That, or what did I have to do at work today that I'm not going to be able to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because I was also kind of bummed that I didn't come in. Like I said about being sick, I was \u2013 I mean, obviously I knew that I couldn't, but I still felt stupid, like, what the fuck? I just felt \u2013 it's just a pet peeve. I don't know. Being sick is a pet peeve of mine. And it's funny, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">too, out of all people, it's Kelly's pet peeve, too.

Her son, you know. And also she's like me, I think she just kind of tries to walk things off, but that's probably not the way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: So that's important, too, that you'd feel stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just felt like, ugh, I hate being sick, and hacking, coughing really bad, and just feeling shitty, and it's stopping me from doing things, and I've \u2013 yeah. I wasn't super angry at myself, but I was just kind of frustrated, bummed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: The fact of frustrated turning into I feel stupid, it's like it's a defect, a personal defect somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I think that's part of the making the phone call and announcing I am sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">THERAPIST: So I can't come. I feel bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's just that thing I have about when you're sick, it's somehow...

I didn't think \u2013 no, no. I just felt just annoyed with myself or the situation. Yeah. But (pause) yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: For a day, you get to get away from those feelings then, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">THERAPIST: By avoiding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: I just shut everything out, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">THERAPIST: But then they're there waiting for you when you get back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, but in a way, yeah, that's one good thing about it was I didn't beat myself up too much, so then when I called you, I didn't \u2013 I was like, no, I feel bad, I should call. I didn't feel bad like I'm an idiot so much as \u2013 so that's better. I was like, look, for one day, I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB1\">\u2013 because it wasn't just about here, or whatever. I just totally shut everything out, and I was like, that happens sometimes. I just needed a totally mental health\/coughing sick day or whatever. Oh, that's ironic to say I needed a mental health day, but you know what I mean. Just zoned out. But yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098494\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Did you imagine me here waiting for you when the time comes and goes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: No, I don't think about \u2013 I mean the only thing I think is I just feel bad.

No, no. I really didn't think about it too much. That was the good thing about \u2013 this time felt very different than in the way in the past when I would just not show up. I just felt like you know what, I just feel wiped. I feel just \u2013 and (inaudible at 09:01).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">And I do, I mean, there's so much going on, like the record. I definitely \u2013 when I stop to think about it, it's not \u2013 it's all \u2013 there's a lot of good stuff, but I definitely feel overwhelmed. And stressed\/adrenaline, you know. Like with the record, I'm just barely \u2013 even with the fucking Kickstarter, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD1\">I'm barely \u2013 I just have enough to get the record out. I don't even have enough to pay for the graphic design. I need someone to help me out with that. It's like it's just whatever. But anyway. But that's okay. I can still just get it done, so it's like all these little \u2013 I just feel there's a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD2\">good stuff, but I just feel kind of anxious and all over the place a little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">I did, though, yesterday or the day \u2013 yesterday, finish my application to consolidate on my student loans.

Yep. Because the thing is, once I do that, I don't have any other bad debt, or there's nothing else on my credit, you know what I mean. It's all this bullshit, so once I do that and I get them to report to the credit bureau, I can just rebuild my credit. It really won't take that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C31\">long really once \u2013 so that was good. I took care of that. I thought that's kind of a big deal. And it felt good because I was like, am I doing this right? I've got a shitload of loans. Do I have to put each one individually, or whatever? But then I called then and they were like, \"No, once we have your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C32\">account numbers and everything, we just go to the national blah, blah, blah, whatever, we see all your loans.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">Although that kind of made me feel stupid, too.

Yeah, that did \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Then I wondered if you were mad, or if there was something \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: No. Nothing.

I wasn't even in a particularly awful mood. I was just sick, so I was just sleeping a lot and drinking soup, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">watching The West Wing.

Yeah, that's a really good point. Yeah, that's all I could think. I didn't think about that then, but yeah, today, I was like, why? At first I was thinking, I said, why am I \u2013 everything's great. I went to a meeting at work. That feels good. I don't know. One way or the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201071\">other, the record's going to come out within three weeks, I think. We're playing the record really \u2013 things are \u2013 you know what I mean? But so first, I was like, why am I not able to fucking concentrate right now on anything. Then with Kelly, I was like, what do I want the girl to say? She has to somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201072\">match word for word? It's not about me, you know what I mean. Or what if in that moment actually, she's not good. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">She's at work, and whatever, but that's her \u2013 she's not going to be like, well, actually, I'm kind of annoyed I'm at work, or whatever. I just hate that, that it's \u2013 I just \u2013 and that's when I was like, you know what, I'm just trying to find a way to be anxious. That's what's happening now. Other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201091\">wouldn't even think twice about that. They'd be like, hey, babe, what's up? Okay. Just... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">I mean, I've gotten \u2013 and I try to remind myself, well, I've gotten way, way, way better, way better. I mean I'm so proud of how I'm handling this Kelly thing. Whether it works out or it doesn't, I'm not going to have anything to second guess so far. I don't \u2013 like yesterday, I think maybe we did text <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B1\">yesterday or whatever, but I'm just \u2013 it's at a good pace. I don't overdo anything. I really don't even over think anything too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">It's just once in a while, I get a little \u2013 but I do catch myself, luckily. That's a huge, huge, huge change, so that way it doesn't, you know. Again, I don't dwell on it the way I used to, but it's just something I've noticed, I seem to find a way to sometimes get a little anxious. I even get anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D1\">when I'm going to see her. Instead of thinking of, well, it's so good right now. Instead of truly being excited to see her, I'm more anxious actually. Once I see her, we have a good time, but even then I'm like, I'm definitely internally monitoring, all right, is the sex good? Am I doing a good job, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D2\">or how's the conversation? As if lone little thing, and I'm never going to see her again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">THERAPIST: What it sounds like \u2013 I mean I hear you wanting to remind yourself, maybe remind me a lot that it's so different. I think we can take that as it's just a given to me \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: When we're talking about it now, on the outside, all the actions you feel comfortable with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: It's more just you're now looking at what's inside, even though you might be doing what everything you feel okay with on the outside.

Because it has to be the case, right? There have to be people in the world to, like, hey, babe, and they just don't think about it. They literally \u2013 obviously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Oh, sure. Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: I just, I need to somehow get to a semblance of that. I mean, where I'm just not \u2013 and not just that, just in general where I'm just not \u2013 I mean, I know myself. I've accepted \u2013 I think part of it is also accepting who you are, and I'm an artist, whatever, and I just \u2013 my brain goes. But there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201291\">got to be a way to manage it a little bit better and have some more of a \u2013 some tranquil positive, or you're just not \u2013 where little, tiny, completely insignificant things aren't triggering irrational anxiety. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">And you know what bothers me too is, we've talked about it, I don't even \u2013 unless I really stop and I'm here and I really think, it doesn't even cross my mind to be like, this is a two-way street. I keep making it as if she's not giving this any thought, and she's just totally fine, whatever, and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B1\">some \u2013 you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">She's thinking about stuff, too. Like, does he care that I'm a little bit overweight, or it kind of sucks that we only see \u2013 she's mentioned it once or twice, that she's like, \"I know we see each other once a week, and it's a little \u2013 it'd be fun to see each other more often,\" or whatever. \"I want you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D1\">to meet my kid,\" or should I do that now? You know what I mean? I make it sound \u2013 I always make it seem as if other people, not just romantically, but somehow other people just cruising along, and that's so bad because it disconnects you from \u2013 it puts all the pressure on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: It makes you very alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: The outsider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: As the only vulnerable person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: And also it's a little selfish or a little narcissistic or whatever. And it's a way of putting yourself down, too, in a way. It's like as if other people are somehow better at this stuff. It's like everybody has their moments of anxiety or nervousness, or their trepidation. But for some reason, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201391\">that doesn't console or appease. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: That's why I think I was wondering what if you thought or imagined what my experience was when you weren't here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: No, it didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: When you didn't show up and didn't call.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">THERAPIST: And (inaudible at 25:06) meant it's morally \u2013 that I would be in this place of judging, that's it.

It's like it doesn't matter that much to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Like it only matters to you, not so much to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">CLIENT: Or I'll think something like \u2013 or even if it matters, it's like a blip, and then I'll be like, whatever, and then it's like moving along. I guess, I mean I don't know. Like I said, it's not like in my conscious thought, but I'm sure that I must be subconsciously be thinking that people move <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201711\">on, and whatever, and they... (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: Maybe in that way, not calling actually might kind of enforce that it's not a blip. Then I have to think for a while, where is he? Is he coming? Is he coming?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: Hm, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">THERAPIST: So I have to think about it for longer, I wonder?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe subconsciously, I don't know. I have no idea. (pause) For example, you know that website Etsy, or whatever? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">THERAPIST: It sounds familiar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah, there's this really cool Web site that you can buy vintage shoes, and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Oh, uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">CLIENT: And just stuff, really cool stuff. So I went on there, and there were all these shoes that I wanted to buy Kelly. So I bought her a pair of these shoes, right. They're like these red, kind of 1950s or 60s pumps with this design thing on them, I don't know. But even that, I'm like, is she really <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201811\">going to like \u2013 what if she doesn't love them? What if she \u2013 you know what I mean? What the fuck am I talking about? I bought her shoes. We can just joke about it. I can be like, yeah, I saw these online. They looked pretty cool. I don't know in real life what you \u2013 who the fuck gives a shit? That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201812\">a really thoughtful thing to do for someone. A lot of boyfriends don't buy shoes online for their girlfriend, but even that, it's like somehow things hinge on that, on these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098494\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: It all has a feel of people being interested or loving you, or thinking about you, or feeling like you matter to them is really conditional, and that at a moment's notice, somebody could do one thing and it's done. It just makes me wonder more about \u2013 we know, of course, your father and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201831\">son that isn't bad (ph) is something that's dramatically different and done, but it feels like there's something much earlier about relationships. Loving \u2013 being there and not being there like your parents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: Can I ask you something that's related but unrelated? We've never fully talked about this but I'm pretty sure that in terms of if there was a diagnosis or whatever, one of the things kind of would be PTSD, right, for me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">THERAPIST: Why do you ask?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">CLIENT: I don't know why I'm asking. It's been on my mind. For some reason, I don't know if I saw something about Iraq, or \u2013 oh, no, this thing about soldiers, so many suicides in the army and all that, and I was thinking about it. And I was like, it'd be kind of helpful just because it's some \u2013 there <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201891\">has got to be some element to that. All those deaths, all those \u2013 to go from being a really shy, sensitive kid to all these incredibly tragic \u2013 there's got to be something that \u2013 because what happens is when I think about that, then I think of memories, like being out \u2013 remember I always had these memories, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201892\">like they're there but they're not there. And I know that that was me, but it just seems so surreal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">That seems to me like those are PTSD-type things where I clearly was not \u2013 I was thinking the other day about my American Express, and how I used American Express in L.A., like completely no thought. I don't even remember what my thoughts were, do you know what I mean? I would just take cash advances. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B1\">I was broke. I didn't know what I was doing, but I wouldn't make any effort to try to pay it back, or to \u2013 I just don't know what was \u2013 I never thought like, well, maybe I should get a job at a bar, or just any kind of job. There was something \u2013 I was so frozen and paralyzed, that's got to be something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B2\">\u2013 that can't just be just some kind of clinical depression. I feel like something that's much more severe. What I've dealt with, I think, is \u2013 and I'm not trying to say that because I want a label, but it kind of helpful to just \u2013 I don't know. I just find it helpful a little bit to be like, you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B3\">what, the severity of this is profound. If I stopped to \u2013 if I was just sitting in a bar articulating all these stories, it's beyond unusual. It's really fucked up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">THERAPIST: The more you talk about it, there become more and more layers of different kinds of trauma. And the only reason I hesitate is it's \u2013 if you're asking about the specifics of the diagnosis, it has to include the things like having flashbacks, or constant nightmares about an experience, avoidance <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D1\">of things that remind you of a specific traumatic experience. But \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">CLIENT: There's a lot of overlap, yeah. For all those years, like even now, I mean now I'm so much better, but not wanting to hear anything about heart attacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2018E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098494\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: Not wanting to say that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">CLIENT: Seeing bizarre dreams. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">CLIENT: All those times when I would see dreams where I couldn't wake up.

So yeah, just \u2013 I don't know. I don't know. For some reason I was like, you know what, I think that would just make me feel \u2013 I'm not trying to force it, I just \u2013 it would somehow make me feel like there's some kind of \u2013 it's so fucking chaotic and insane that it just would be <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F1\">a little bit helpful to be like, okay, you know what? It's not exactly \u2013 I mean I wasn't a veteran in Nam or something, but it's like it gives me something to hang my hat on and be like, all right, this is kind of pretty much what happened to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And you've been traumatized, Brian. And I think, in different ways, beginning with things that you wonder about. I mean, maybe, not even beginning, maybe things before then, but from sexual experiences as a boy to your father's death, to even the layers of being ostracized or the outsider. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A11\">Your mother, the not favored sister, within the family, the political, extreme contentiousness that leads you getting kicked out of the house sometime. Multiple deaths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">CLIENT: Picking up and moving, being so close to my family, being the first one born in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Ripped from your roots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">CLIENT: And going to North Carolina where I don't know who I am, and suddenly, there's no thought of you're Assyrian, or whatever, but then you move and then you have to think about that because people are looking at you funny, and treating you funny, and being alone, and all that shit about not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A71\">to school, kicking and screaming, and yeah, it's just all this fucked up shit. Yeah, it all just feels traumatic to me. It's just very strange. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">THERAPIST: It feels new to me for you to let it in as that, to know it as that. I say that because I think there have been times I've said, \"Holy cow, that's unbelievable what you've endured.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">THERAPIST: And you kind of, well, well, a lot of people go through this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, you're right. No. Not anymore. (Laughing) No. I think it's because I feel so much better now that I can have some perspective and not feel so uncomfortable or like a loser, or so angry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">THERAPIST: It's actually not your fault what's happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, no. And now I can now take some ownership and feel kind of proud because when I tell the story, it's like a lot of people would not \u2013 I'm doing pretty fucking well for \u2013 I mean, I'm incredibly well adjusted considering. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) I remember you were just talking about kids being cruel when you were in North Carolina. At times, you had several stories you told me of them throwing rocks at you at one point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B9\">THERAPIST: And saying \u2013 I mean my jaw was dropping with \u2013 that is trauma. That is trauma. And as soon as I said that, you're like, eh, well, not really. So there's something, maybe something feels different now, like there's some space to know that in a different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think it's partly \u2013 well, it's obviously coming here. I think lately, it might be Cecelia, too. There's something about that critter, like I love her so much. It's crazy, and she's so pure and loving. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098494\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">Like last night, I literally couldn't sleep because I could not believe \u2013 she's right here curled up. I've got my arm around her, and she's snoring kind of, like purring snoring, and I'm like what the fuck is going on here? This living creature with so much love in herself, and she kind of stretches <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD1\">and makes sure I'm there. She puts her paws on me and stuff. I think there's something about that that's like, wow. Human beings are fucked up. There's something about the purity and innocence of a critter like that that \u2013 I don't know. You feel like, wow, humans are flawed, and we fuck each other up <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD2\">so bad. I mean, I don't know. I'm just \u2013 maybe it's not that, but I feel like that \u2013 obviously coming here, but there's something, too, about that connection that I've never had. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you can simultaneously as you start to feel \u2013 you described it as unconditional love with her. A more unconditional loving back, loving (overlapping voices) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">CLIENT: I've never loved any living thing the way I love this cat. I mean, it sounds crazy, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">THERAPIST: So as that starts to come alive, it's real and it also carries with it knowing how much you haven't had that. So it's both terribly happy tears and sad tears at the same time. When you say about humanity and how often those (overlapping voices) \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">CLIENT: Well, it's like all those quotes that people throughout the ages \u2013 you're not a full human being until you've really loved an animal or something like that. It makes perfect sense. It's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C7\">THERAPIST: She even snores and you love her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, because of these cute little cat purr snores, whatever. It's not even snores, but just even her breathing, the fact that she's just a breathing creature, it's like what the fuck? This is so weird. I just can't get over it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Something about her you're saying as being alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Like this living thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D1\">CLIENT: It's nature. It's like unadulterated nature. There's no affectation to her. She's a critter. She just needs me for food and water and love. And that's insane. So when you look in her eyes, it's pure nature. There's no \u2013 it's just an amazing thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Maybe humans aren't so far off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">CLIENT: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">THERAPIST: I said and maybe humans aren't so far off in their needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's as if we've diverged from the fact that that's what we are, but we've kind of gotten derailed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Or hurt and abused.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DF\">THERAPIST: And then a little these self-protections build up. That lead us to hurt and abuse. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E1\">It could also be in the what gets played out with calling and not calling, deciding not to call, it's like there's some testing or trying to reaffirm am I like Cecelia or am I like your mother, or is there something unconditional or is it conditional here? Would I be mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">CLIENT: Maybe on some \u2013 I don't know if it's that far, but maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E5\">THERAPIST: I know I'm stretching it beyond what you're consciously saying, but when you're returning to the old, I think that's a piece of it. It's like returning to the assumption that you're alone, and it's conditional everywhere.

So they've granted again 13 sessions for you to transition out at this point, so I just said okay, and I don't think he's going to do that. But at that point, I will try to appeal it again. Because I couldn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202091\">\u2013 I was shocked that they even approved these 13 sessions, I think it's highly unlikely they would do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">CLIENT: Right, right.

You could even lower your copay if you ever got on an independent Blue Cross plan or something, or if they changed a PPO, that's another way to continue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021B\">CLIENT: Oh, okay, so it's not like suddenly everything will be different after March.
