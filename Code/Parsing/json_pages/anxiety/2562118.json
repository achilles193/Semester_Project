(pause) Sometimes it feels like Thursdays are the only useful sessions. I\u2019m beginning to see why. (pause) I know I feel crunched and I\u2019m a lot less sad to leave on Thursdays.  (pause) I think whatever openings happen feel more organic and slower and better; and there is more <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">space and time to take risks. I think it\u2019s in the spirit of this to wonder when this pain is going to pass (pause) or to ask you about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Does it really matter to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Because it really matters to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I imagined you thought it wasn\u2019t because you anticipated I wouldn\u2019t answer the question or wouldn\u2019t answer the question maybe because I know, for whatever reason, that that\u2019s why it seems like it\u2019s not in the spirit of this.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. (pause) I think it\u2019s also because [nature growth] (ph?) here is so hard to predict and intermittent and spontaneous; (pause) and it\u2019s hard to measure anything.  Beginnings are blurred and endings are probably blurred, too, so it\u2019s like it\u2019s more in the spirit of things to just wait <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">and see, except that it\u2019s really fucking painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: In my mind, all that reality stuff, it doesn\u2019t matter at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it gets really old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: And what matters is that it\u2019s painful and you want to know. From another angle, I understand reality patters but . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Do you think this is what I will mainly work through, too? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I have a fear that (pause) you will say that you\u2019re done with me before I\u2019m ready.  Or you will say that I\u2019m done with you before I\u2019m ready. (long pause)  It\u2019s very scary to me, even though it\u2019s not how things have happened in my life. It\u2019s like the idea is much more scary than just staying in reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s happened to you plenty of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s happened here once. (pause)  Oh \u2013 I have to leave before I\u2019m ready. I have to leave people before I\u2019m ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:17) without acknowledging that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s the same way as the no-fault thing. Somebody has actually abandoned me or it feels really bad to think of it that way or it feels wrong or scary. Maybe it\u2019s about power, like I\u2019m powerless to think that it\u2019s happening.  Nobody has really abandoned me. People get really abandoned in their <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">life and that\u2019s a really different feeling. I lived with orphans in Italy who were actually abandoned. (pause) It\u2019s different, but how can I know?  It seems different. It felt like I was pulling that Italian orphan card recently. (both laugh) Wait a minute \u2013 let me tell you about abandonment, Jay. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">have no idea. I know. When really, it occurred to me that I . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I forget who it was, but somebody brought up powerlessness recently and I guess the way that you just did it, again, flips it around more in terms of who knows what exactly and who is in control, because that seems so far apart, too. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562118\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Like suddenly if I start talking about Italian orphans, I start to feel more in control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I get a sense that suggests I know what abandonment looks like. I\u2019ve worked with very vulnerable kids to whom that could happen; and I know that that is not what happened to me. I guess I sort of heard an implication, although it is possible I read into this, something like I know and you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">Jay, don\u2019t know in the same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course you know. (pause)  Maybe not in the exact same way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m referring to the fantasy you seem to be in at that moment, which you don\u2019t seem to be in any more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: [You do not give me what I want.] (ph?) It makes me think that this teaching will evolve while jabbering away. I think about that a lot when I get into an area of pain, which helps me step away from that.  (pause) There is a real instinct to wonder about the mismatch of conditions in my life <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">and my strong emotions, like the conditions don\u2019t seem to support how strongly I feel or give reasons for it.  (pause) I think that is a source of a lot of pain, anxiety and confusion. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And I think you imagine an interest in those feelings in me that you then work a little bit to disqualify, like existed with the . . . (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I feel like can\u2019t you see that it\u2019s me who is responding in the wrong way to all of these apparent events? It\u2019s not what the other person did. (pause) That\u2019s how I feel. I don\u2019t see how that makes things really hard for me, but it\u2019s how I feel about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s your conviction \u2013 that your feelings are out of whack to what really happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) It\u2019s like moms have to go to work. That\u2019s a reasonable thing. It\u2019s unreasonable to cry about it for so long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And people have to leave their family vacations and their families, and that reasonable.  It\u2019s unreasonable to cry about it for so long. If you don\u2019t want to pay out of pocket for therapy, it\u2019s reasonable to find somebody else so you don\u2019t have to pay out of pocket. It\u2019s unreasonable to cry <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">about that for so long. Or like (pause) . . . the last one doesn\u2019t actually feel reasonable to me \u2013 the last one being we\u2019re in a specific relationship and we\u2019re not in any other relationship.  And why that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t really know why. It\u2019s just the way it happened; like why we didn\u2019t find each <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">other much earlier. Sometimes it feels like well, this is a reasonable way to be with somebody that, most of the time, actually it feels like it\u2019s completely wrong, (pause) a completely inappropriate way to be with you, for whom I feel so much. But then it\u2019s like sometimes it feels like it works because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200473\">this can be really intense and intimate and maybe allows for more of that than a more conventional relationship that I have in mind. It gets really confusing.  (pause) I got very anxious about it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I imagine that it\u2019s like the roles from a few minutes ago are reversed and maybe I\u2019m going to tell you what the realities are and what makes sense and why you\u2019re confused about that or it feels totally different from that to you.  That\u2019s not right.

(long pause)  From what I can tell, you are very fond of me. (pause) [But it doesn\u2019t stick] (ph?) like this other disqualifying feeling, Jay, like somehow it takes up a lot more room.  My time [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:51) [my feelings are unqualified.] (ph?) (long pause)  I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">I\u2019m waiting for you to confirm that you are very fond of me or like it was very risky to say it or something. (long pause)  I think when you feel dependent; actually, like I have done something in the moment to abandon you, you kind of find me and bring me back.  I guess what I was smiling about was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">the ways I could imagine you doing that, like clearing your throat or \u201cnow over to you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. [ ] (inaudible at 00:34:14) to those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: But I guess I think the more serious point is that it becomes very difficult to sit with or to contain the worry and upset in that moment where it feels like I have left you by not responding when you have really put yourself out there and you show it to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: It\u2019s very, very, very hard to contain. It brings up [feelings of how I feel and think, but I doubt in everything.] (ph?)  Like nothing is good. No [ ] is good. Nothing good is ever going to happen. (pause) [Sometimes I feel] (ph?) very foreign to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s sort of like I stabbed you in the heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Again, the agency isn\u2019t quite there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.  I had a stake in my heart and I don\u2019t know who put it there or how it got there. Certainly you could take it out; and you\u2019re not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I guess that\u2019s what\u2019s clear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Those are feelings and the thoughts are equally foreign, like oh, Jay probably hates me. He probably completely hates me; and that\u2019s really foreign. I don\u2019t ever perseverate on that or think that it\u2019s true or suffer from that kind of thinking, but here it is.  And it\u2019s hard to know how to hold <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">on then.
