Hello Jessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Hi, Debbie.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So, you told me, when we first said, \u201cHello,\u201d this evening that you\u2019re physically not in great shape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: No, no, no \u2013 not in good shape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: So, the same thing that\u2019s been going on since we started the sessions, which is the stuff with my neck. So, I actually decided\u2014I mean, today, it got to the point\u2014I was at work and stress in any kind of way doesn\u2019t help and work \u2013 as much as I like my job \u2013 is stress. And with having to get ready <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">for a leave, because I did decide that I\u2019m going to be having surgery next Thursday, there\u2019s a lot to get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: When you say, \u201cNext Thursday,\u201d in three days or Thursday of next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: No, Thursday of next week is when I\u2019m scheduled to have surgery. So I still have some days left to get prepared for a leave. But it\u2019s a big leave. It\u2019s like a period of six to eight weeks. I was concerned about I had to get medical forms in, I had to get coverage, I had to get\u2014you name it. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">then, in the meantime, seeing\u2014I have pretty much like an 80-child caseload of mandates, so students that I work with, I was trying to make sure that I was able to see my students. And, of course, knowing in my mind that\u2014and writing a letter that\u2014to say good-bye for the period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">So, needless to say, it\u2019s been very, very challenging. And, today, just my pain and I don\u2019t know whether it was fully related, because on Saturday, I wasn\u2019t as stressed about\u2014like how I was in school today. It was just a nice. I went to the movies and I was in incredible pain. So because it is nerve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">pain, there\u2019s not always a rhyme or a reason. I could have an okay day and then I can have a horrific day and there\u2019s no explanation as to why.  You could say stress could make it worse but sometimes it is that and sometimes it isn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So needless to say, I was at work and there\u2019s a couch at my job. And I literally just\u2014I was dealing with some really intense cases today. And I just lay down at the end of the day, closed the door, and just really felt that I needed to leave. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">But then I got myself together and I realized that the pain had gotten a little bit better and subsided somewhat. So I went down to continue what I\u2019d been doing, work and everything, and trying to manage the fact that I don\u2019t have a whole lot of time left before I take my leave. And so I\u2019m in a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">bit of a\u2014in limbo right now, in terms of trying to get everything done, knowing that it\u2019s not going to be perfect. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Well, if you truly accept that it\u2019s not going to be perfect, and if you accept the likelihood of your not getting everything done that you want to get done, how are you in limbo? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m in a lot of pain and so I think that I\u2019m a little bit\u2014probably the\u2014I have accepted that. I think that what I\u2019m probably having a harder time accepting is just the pain level and how it does stop me from doing the things that I want to do. I think that\u2019s where I am having <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">a more difficult time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Well, wait. It stops you doing a number of things you like to do, but not everything that you like to. I want you to notice the way I\u2019m listening to your words.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561804\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m not just taking as gospel everything you say. You\u2019re not in limbo. It doesn\u2019t stop you doing what you like to do. It stops you doing some things you like to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Well, working.  It\u2019s stopping me from working right now. I mean, I\u2019m getting the surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Your words were, \u201cIt does stop me doing what I like to do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Okay, let me\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: No, no, no, let me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Oh, sorry, sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m being bold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Because I want to model for you, now, the way I want you to think. Because thinking in such ways will help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: The way I want you to continue to work on using your awareness to think about your thinking. And then, in your own way, to do what I\u2019m doing \u2013 which is to not take your initial words or thoughts as Gospel truth. If you stop and separate from your thoughts, and take a few moments to assess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">the validity of them and, really, that relates to one of the issues from our last session, which was interesting and informative and, at times, hysterically funny, if you remember.  But you agreed with me, and with my observation, that your \u2013at times \u2013 racing mind doesn\u2019t serve you well in all instances <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">and in many instances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">Al used to say, very frequently \u2013 when he and I would give presentations and talks and workshops \u2013 that unlike other animals, who also think\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: [giggles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: as far as we know, humans are the only species who can choose to think about their thinking. So, in this session, let\u2019s both focus on what you say, in terms of sticking to your answering the question that I might ask, or sticking with the issue that we\u2019re looking at, focusing on any catastrophizing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">and should-ing that might spill out.  And to catch it, not just letting it go. Okay? So, if I am at times \u2013 going to interrupt tonight, it\u2019s with that purpose. Is that agreeable to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Good. Good, good, good. And since we\u2019re pausing here, I also want to ask: remember at the beginning of our last session, our attempts to do a relaxation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Which ended up, I think, no further than below the neck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Starting from the top of the head and peals of laughter, which \u2013 in its own way \u2013 was therapeutic, in a sense. However, I\u2019m not going to attempt to do it now, with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: But a suggestion for you to keep in mind, particularly before and after your surgery \u2013 which is coming up \u2013 and for your use in the rest of your life\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: that something that many people do, which they find helpful, is a progressive body relaxation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: When there\u2019s some stress or tension in the body, or the mind is too active, you can apply it. And you do that very simply by suggesting to yourself what I suggested. You, yourself, would direct your attention to the top of your head and\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: let that part of you relax and then go down to the forehead, the ears, the brain, the face, every muscle, and every cell\u2014and consciously relax it. Feel the kind of warm, easy, heaviness in a positive sense \u2013 a dropping of tension, in other words \u2013 in every part that you focus on. And some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">people who are visually inclined also do it that way or prefer doing it in this following way: where they first identify a color that they find soothing and healing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561804\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: And they imagine that color at the top of their head\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: and that it slowly enters through the skull and relaxes and fills every cell, every tissue, every bone, every part, and let it work down. A lot of people who do this, may not get past the nose or the neck or the belly button\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Because they\u2019re so relaxed, by the time\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And they might fall asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: So keep that in mind, in your toolkit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Okay? All right. And then, so the homework that we decided that you might try was . . .?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, so, we did\u2014I\u2019ll tell you the homework. I didn\u2019t cut corners this time.  [chuckles] But not only did I do the homework, but something actually occurred that I\u2019d like to share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Tell me the homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Oh, tell you the homework first? Oh, yeah, sure. It was just to go over, to read again the effective new philosophies on all of the A, B, C, D, and E\u2019s. But really hone in on the effective new philosophies, because that was where I was tending to struggle a little bit more and had sort of left <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">out the last time. So it was just to do that and just to do one thorough \u2013 if possible, more \u2013 A, B, C, D, E, all the way until the end, yeah. The whole enchilada: A, B, C, D, E.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right. Right. So how about you tell me about that now, and then tell me whatever it was you were starting to tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Well, the reason why I don\u2019t want to do in that order \u2013 if it\u2019s okay \u2013 is because what happens relates to why I chose to do this particularly\u2014why I chose this A, B, C\u2014this activating event.  Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yes, it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: So, I think\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: First of all, first of all, did you do the homework reading?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: All right. So, then tell me as you prefer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Just, oh, okay. So, well, I think it\u2019s very interesting, what happened, because I sort of used\u2014I don\u2019t want to say I was \u201cforced to\u201d use REBT, but I found it very beneficial to use REBT in a moment that happened in my family last week, after\u2014our session? I\u2019m trying to think. Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: When\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: So\u2014when did I see you, Monday\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Not Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Wait, I saw you Wednesday? I did? Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yes, you did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: I\u2019m so confused because\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Oh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: No, Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Because this happened Thursday, that\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">CLIENT: This incident happened Thursday. So basically, I think it\u2019s really important because I could\u2019ve allowed it to affect me differently.  But what ended up happening, the gist of it was that my \u2013 as I\u2019ve mentioned before \u2013 my parents tendencies when I was growing up and the way that they raised <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">me were very, very controlling and sort of created dependent children as opposed to creating independent children, and that\u2019s inclusive of myself and my brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">And what happened was on Thursday evening \u2013 so it was the night after our session and everything\u2019s very fresh from our last session \u2013 my mom and I were on the telephone and my brother\u2019s\u2014an ex who\u2019s now a friend of my brother\u2019s had called in. And she has a drinking issue. And so, she had called in and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">she was actually drunk and was calling my parents\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561804\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Your friend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: My brother\u2019s ex\u2014this was an ex-girlfriend who\u2019s still friends with my brother. They still continue to be friends even though they\u2019ve been no longer as an item for a number of years now, two or three years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">So she\u2019s been close with my family and so, she reached out to my family to say that she was very\u2014she was so worried about my brother and even alluded to \u2013 I mean, I think it\u2019s important to say this here, because instead of making things fluffy \u2013 that she thought he was going to hurt\u2014maybe commit\u2014saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">it in this way because my brother is so\u2014she was drunk, and so things were\u2014but my brother\u2019s friend happened to call. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">He called her, the ex-girlfriend, to let her know that he was all\u2014everybody was in hysterics because Jeff \u2013 that\u2019s my brother \u2013 was so, so, so down because he doesn\u2019t have a job. And he hasn\u2019t had a\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, but he\u2019s had a couple of jobs. It\u2019s been about 10 years or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">11 years since he\u2019s been out of college. And he\u2019s had jobs\u2014he\u2019ll have a job and then he\u2019ll even have it for maybe a couple of months and then he would lose it. Then he would go for like a year and he wouldn\u2019t have a job. My parents would pay the bills, do all that. Then he would get another job, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B92\">he would lose it. He would have it for a few months then it would be same thing, he wouldn\u2019t have a job. So you get the gist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">So this has been a pattern. This has been going on for years and years and years. And it\u2019s nothing new or surprising to me anymore when either my brother calls or my parents call and say, \u201cJeff lost his job.\u201d Or they\u2019ll call and say, \u201cYour brother is so down. He\u2019s looking for a job.\u201d So that\u2019s where <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">we\u2019re at right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">And so what happened was my mom had\u2014when I was on the phone and I\u2019d found out what had happened, that this ex had called my parents and was concerned, my mom said to me, she said, \u201cJessa,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t stand this.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m so down, and I\u2014\u201d \u2013 and this is typical conversation, by the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">\u2013 she said, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll only be happy when he gets a job.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">Now, mind you, I\u2019ve been hearing this same kind of lingo for ten years. So I took the opportunity to say, \u201cWhat are you telling yourself right now, when you are saying that you\u2019ll only be happy when he gets a job?\u201d And it was really interesting to see sort of the way that it took, because she said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF1\">\u201cI\u2019m not eating over this and I\u2019m so down and I can\u2019t stand it, I can\u2019t take it and he needs a job desperately.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell\u2014\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So she didn\u2019t answer your question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: No, no, she did, actually. Because when I said, \u201cWhat are you telling yourself?\u201d she said, \u201cI blame myself.\u201d She did, for the first time\u2014I forgot to mention that, because she hasn\u2019t really ever said fully that or taken any bit of ownership. It\u2019s more just like, \u201cI need him to get a job.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">Then she started to say, she said, \u201cI blame myself.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, is that helping you?\u201d I [laughs] and then I\u2019m like, \u201cOh God, look at what I said !\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561804\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ll give you an REBT certificate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, oh, I did. I said that. I said, \u201cReally, the REBT that I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d I hope it\u2019s okay that I mention it, I said, \u201cwith Debbie,\u201d I said, \u201chas been really beneficial because it teaches the ways that you think and how a certain way of thinking can be very unproductive and not really get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">you anywhere.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd so, I\u2019m not saying it point fingers or say, \u2018You did this,\u2019 or, \u2018Jeff did this,\u2019 or anybody did this.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s more to help the situation.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd so, I keep seeing a pattern. And I see that this has been going on for a number of years and that nothing\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C92\">changing.\u201d And then she said, \u201cYou\u2019re so negative.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">And I didn\u2019t say anything in that moment, but I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWell, actually, no.\u201d No, I did say it, I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m realistic.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m being realistic.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m just looking at what the situation is and how it\u2019s been.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">And then she insisted on saying, as always \u2013 I\u2019m going to say \u201calways\u201d because that\u2019s her tendency \u2013 is, when I was\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: No, instead of saying \u201calways\u201d you can say \u201cas has been the case till now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Has been her tendency, not always but tends to be what she says is, \u201cThis brings me back to when my father (meaning her father, my grandfather) always lost a job and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t your father. This is a different situation.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">want to continue to go over that,\u201d I said, \u201cyou will have every reason to do that. But,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how beneficial that\u2019s going to be.\u201d I said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s now 40-something years later, maybe more.\u201d I said, \u201cSo you can choose to do that if you want,\u201d I said, \u201cor you can\u2014\u201d and then I pushed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D12\">it a little bit, I said, \u201cOr you can be,\u201d because what tends to happen is that they collude with each other.  So my brother will call, \u201cMa, Ma, Ma,\u201d she\u2019ll run to his rescue. I said, \u201cYou can continue to do that,\u201d I said, \u201cif you want. Or you can say to Jeff, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m not your therapist.\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D13\">I am going to call up every REBT therapist that I know, and,\u201d I said, \u201cand possibly bring it\u2014walk him over,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd be supportive. That\u2019s not having him be dependent,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re actually encouraging him that there are opportunities to make a better life.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">So she heard me. She definitely heard me. And then I found out, the next day, that she took a Xanax and half a glass of wine and put herself to sleep and did okay. That was her coping strategy. [laughs] But she definitely sounded to me, the next day, like she was not as distraught over the situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D31\">and she wasn\u2019t saying, like, \u201cI\u2019m so down,\u201d how she may have typically done in the past. Because I think she realized that she couldn\u2019t pull that with me, because that wouldn\u2019t really get her anywhere to do that. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Well, well, well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, so, I think\u2014my homework, then, was based on\u2014I took that opportunity to then read the effective new philosophies. And what I\u2019ve started to notice and then I get a little bit hard on myself and I realize that it\u2019s okay is that I\u2019m going to back to my tendencies, because this has only been <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">12 sessions and my life has been 30-something years of thinking the other ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561804\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: 12 sessions, indeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: 12 so far, and my life has been 30-something years of habits. And so I will easily go back. But that\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: You may easily go back. The way you said it means you are psychic !How can you predict the future?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Um . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I said you may easily go back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: You may tend to. But if you use the words you used, you\u2019re making an absolutistic prediction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m trying to break a habit, so I guess I thought habits don\u2019t break easily and that\u2019s the reality. Okay, I got you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: See, I was catching you thinking in unhelpful ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Okay, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I recommend that you do what I\u2019m doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I want you to think about your thinking\u2014do you see what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: And to literally watch your language!

No, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: You see?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, I think that what I\u2019m also getting at is that I think what I\u2019m realizing, actually, I should say, is that it takes a lot of work. And it\u2019s work that I\u2019m willing\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Ongoing effort, yes. (And careful of using \u201cshoulds\u201d ! )<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: yeah, so and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine with that. But I think that as long as the ultimate goal is for it to be something positive, then the goal is worth it. I think when you\u2019re working, working\u2014well, in the very beginning of our sessions, I was working just to work. Now, I\u2019m working because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF1\">I want\u2014I\u2019m seeing that it\u2019s\u2014I didn\u2019t know the difference. I really didn\u2019t know.

I was doing it to get the right answer, to do the right thing, or to make it perfect, whereas\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: And then you noticed that you were doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yes.

I\u2019m looking at this as it\u2019s very unfortunate that I\u2019m going through what I am and that I need a lot of help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your definition of \u201ccrisis\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: Horrible, horrible pain that\u2019s incapacitating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: So now you\u2019re in very restrictive pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: So change the language there, too?

I\u2019m in so much pain and I\u2019m having a lot of irrational thoughts about that, about that it shouldn\u2019t be this way. That I shouldn\u2019t be in this much pain. And it\u2019s not fair and this\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014and I\u2019m taking it\u2014but I want to use that right now, because it\u2019s so relevant. <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2055F1\">But I think what I\u2019ve noticed is that I tend to, my tendencies are that I take it to that I\u2019m going to be in pain for every single day for the rest of my life.

Literally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2055F2\">not one pain free day. There\u2019s been glimmers of \u2013 if that\u2019s a word \u2013 of glimpses of less pain on certain days, but when it\u2019s heightened, it just continues to hang out around me.

Just getting harder to be there and to be effective, let\u2019s just say.
