That week of the 25th I\u2019ll let you know for sure next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Okay. I\u2019ve had a very rollercoaster type of week and right now I\u2019m at a much better place than I was a few days ago. I think the last time I spoke to you, we had that big fights, like two Saturdays ago now and he had completely silenced himself and so I was feeling very sad when I spoke to you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">and kept on feeling sad and like an idiot because I think I should have stood my ground and just waited but I can\u2019t I can\u2019t do that. And so I reached out. I think I texted or I sent an e-mail six days ago, so and I wrote something like, \u201cI miss you. That\u2019s all, I just miss you and I\u2019m sorry I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">hurt your Brandon.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So so you \u2013 you, had you hadn\u2019t spoke since that Saturday and then when did you write him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Like, I \u2013 just I miss you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I mean I\u2019m sorry, when when was that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I think it was like, Monday after seeing him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I love that you [inaudible] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: And I didn\u2019t hear anything back and so I cried some more and then like a day later, something else, like \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I raged at you, but there were \u2013 there are a lot of things in our relationship, that you know, we don\u2019t address and I need to address them. I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">No response. And then finally, (SIGHS) this was five days ago I wrote him I wrote him a message. I have all this here because I wanted to read it to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I wrote him: \u201cI need to know what the silence means. Does it mean that you are needing some space? Or does it mean that you never want to talk to me again?\u201d Because he\u2019s so good about just cutting things off. Like, I\u2019m just I don\u2019t understand how he\u2019s able to do that because I\u2019m just very I want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">to resolve things. I want to I guess I\u2019m a typical girl, like I want to talk through things and I don\u2019t think turning away from conflict and just cutting all connection is how you do it, so finally he e-mails me.  He doesn\u2019t even text me back, he e-mails me: \u201cPlease stop. You said, absolutely horrible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">things to me and not for the first time. Stop trying to turn this around and make me being silent \u2018cool.\u2019\u201c Because I said, \u201cyour silence is really cool.\u201d \u201cNo one made you do or say what you did, it was your choice.\u201d And I\u2019m left feeling like are we speaking two different languages? Like I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">what he\u2019s talking about. What did I do? What did I say? As far as I\u2019m concerned, the fight on Saturday was about me basically saying I\u2019ve had enough, what\u2019s happening with this, I haven\u2019t met your son. I haven\u2019t seen you making any indication that you\u2019re going to leave her, like what\u2019s going on? And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">then, he just responds with this, so I wrote him back: \u201cBut it is cruel, Brian, it\u2019s hurtful, terribly hurtful to me. I have a lot of rage about issues that are not addressed in this relationship. You don\u2019t ever want to hear it. I\u2019m sorry for hurting you. Is this over?\u201d  And a day later he writes me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">back, \u201cI don\u2019t know. What I do know is that I cannot and will not have someone in my life who thinks it\u2019s okay to talk to me like that.\u201d Again it\u2019s like he\u2019s not addressing anything that I\u2019m upset about. He\u2019s talking to me like I\u2019m a child and it\u2019s just cold and distant. And so, this was I guess Wednesday <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">or something and I was crying at work. My friend came in and talked to me and she was very helpful, actually, because, Penelope she she said two things that really stuck with me. She said that by by continuing to allow him in my life, like I\u2019m basically accepting that this behavior is okay. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D7\">she saw how much pain I was in just from him pulling away from me and cutting off connection. And she\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s really cruel. It\u2019s just, I\u2019m sad for you, like its just \u2013 it\u2019s a really not a nice thing to do and this isn\u2019t the first time he does it. And she also pointed out to me, like it seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D8\">like you\u2019re giving him all the choice. Like I asked him, like \u201cIs this over?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, where\u2019s your choice in this?\u201d  Like don\u2019t you have a say? Don\u2019t you have a say, like I\u2019m not going to put up with certain things. I don\u2019t hear you saying that. And then I kept crying and I said this weekend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D9\">I feel like going out and being self-destructive. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m going to get drunk. I\u2019m going to talk to guys. Like the self-destructiveness I usually get into when I\u2019m upset like this. And she said something else that really stuck with me. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why all that anger isn\u2019t directed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D10\">at him?\u201d \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it directed at him?\u201d Why isn\u2019t it directed at your father, for being so withholding and absent. Why isn\u2019t it directed at your stepfather. Why do you have to turn it towards you? And that really stuck with me and all weekend I did so well. You know?  Like it made me feel like, yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D11\">why am I punishing myself? I want to take care of myself. Like these men haven\u2019t taken care of me. And it worked and it helped me feel good. And I felt a little bit more empowered by Saturday. So Saturday I wrote him back an e-mail in response to that, I wrote: \u201cAnd I cannot and will not have someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D12\">in my life who gives me the silent treatment, refuses to work through conflicts and who can\u2019t make a decision about whether or not he will leave his marriage to pursue a future with me. If you feel that I\u2019m way off with what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m open to discussing this with you, but based on the fact that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D13\">in the past week I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s done any of the reaching out I\u2019m not anticipating there will be a discussion.\u201d And he didn\u2019t write back until last night, so after Saturday, after writing that I was in a good place. I was kind of solemn but I went out on Saturday night with girlfriends and even <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D14\">though I wasn\u2019t haven\u2019t a great time, I was like, Oh I feel connected. These people are asking me, how I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m hearing about their lives. Like, I\u2019m not sitting in my apartment alone, crying. And I felt good about what I had said to him and I just kept on telling myself, like, no you don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D15\">to put up with that. And it it\u2019s like the relationship is always on his terms. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855954\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">I talked to my friend, Carly too and that\u2019s what she said. She said, \u201cDo you see how he doesn\u2019t answer the question, when you ask him is this over? He doesn\u2019t answer it directly, he just says, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know\u2019.\u201d She says, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever going to leave you unless you really walk away, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">the way things are set up it works for him. He sees you once a week, you guys have fun, he\u2019s got the wife at home, and according to her, life is normal and I don\u2019t cause much of a commotion as long as I\u2019m being a good pet. He\u2019s happy. But I\u2019m unhappy. It\u2019s not on my terms, so I think she\u2019s right. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">like \u2013 she said to me, I have a feeling he\u2019s going to reach out to you and it\u2019s going to be up to you to kind of set that boundary. So I was like feeling strong. Like, yes I\u2019m going to do that.  I wasn\u2019t expecting him to reach out and then last night he reaches out. And I really disappointed myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">because I\u2019m not taking a firm stance, like I wish I could. He \u2013 it\u2019s a big pattern of him avoiding anything that I want to talk about, like the whole reason we fought and his marriage. Like, he deflects, he doesn\u2019t answer any of it. And I really feel manipulated in a way, so last night I\u2019m just sitting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F4\">there watching TV and out of nowhere I get a text that says, \u201cI miss you.\u201d And I was really surprised. And so I wrote back, \u201cI miss you too.\u201d And then he writes, \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been on my mind a lot too.\u201d And he writes, \u201cOh?\u201d And then I write, \u201cWondering what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F5\">going through your mind and so much in my everyday life reminds me of you it makes me sad.\u201d And then I guess he answered the question, like what\u2019s going through your mind, and he said, \u201cLots of stuff. You?\u201d  Like always putting it on me. Like he won\u2019t really give me, let me into what\u2019s going on in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F6\">brain, you know? And he just answers back I say, \u201clots of stuff.\u201d And he goes, \u201cMhmm, same.\u201d And I said, \u201cI thought you were never going to speak to me again.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d And then he says, \u201cYou first.\u201d And at that moment I, I was going to say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F7\">no, you know very clearly what I want, you first, but again, it\u2019s me getting soft and not wanting to rock the boat and be a good pet and answer the question and then I\u2019ll let him have his turn and so then I answer. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855954\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">THERAPIST: Kind of what you have found yourself feeling that way\u2014 or are aware of that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">CLIENT: I could \u2013 I could recognize I was doing it in the moment. Like I was getting softer by the second. I said, \u201cI want to be with you, but I want a real relationship not a secret. Your turn.\u201d And then he wrote, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you have to rage at me.\u201d And I wrote back, \u201cyour turn.\u201d And he wrote, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">\u201cI want a real life no more school. Happy, settled.\u201d And I wrote, \u201cThat answer doesn\u2019t include me?\u201d And then \u2013 this is typical of him, he wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you if you\u2019re going to pick negative statements out of everything I said.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve said and I\u2019m not picking, I\u2019m pointing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">something out. The question was, what do you want in regard to the two of us? Your answer didn\u2019t tell me what you want.\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019d like a for-real life.\u201d  I wrote, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a vague statement. Again not picking on you just talking through things here.\u201d Again, it\u2019s me like being a therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200233\">with him. Like calm down child, I\u2019m not accusing you. I\u2019m talking to you like an adult. Like a nice person. I said, \u201cIs it vague because it\u2019s hard to say it?\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re making me sad.\u201d I wrote, \u201cConflict is hard.\u201d He writes, \u201cMaybe it was a mistake to call you.\u201d I wrote, \u201cIt brings up a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200234\">feelings. I\u2019m said too.\u201d And then he just writes, \u201cCatharsis.\u201d And I write, \u201cMe?\u201d back. And whenever he means Catharsis he usually means orgasm. Like it makes him feel closer to be sexual. And I could have predicted that that was going to happen. Like I knew, he\u2019s like sweet-talking me and I bet you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200235\">by the end of this conversation we\u2019re going to end up having phone sex or something. And so I, I wrote, \u201cMe?\u201d back. And he writes, \u201cYou first.\u201d And I said, \u201cI need communication and dialogue before I can have \u2018Catharsis.\u2019\u201d And he just writes, \u201cmhmm.\u201d And I said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to resolve all of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200236\">tonight.\u201d And he writes, \u201cmhmm.\u201d And I write, \u201cI\u2019m glad you texted me.\u201d And he said, \u201cMe too. I guess I can let you go, then, if you\u2019re busy.\u201d (SIGHS) It\u2019s like, like talking to a teenage boy or something. Like we\u2019re not speaking the same language. And I wrote\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855954\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20025\">THERAPIST: Did you get the feeling that he wanted to have phone sex at that point? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">CLIENT: I knew it.

I figured I\u2019d give you a turn.\u201d He said, \u201cYou should call out. Oh, you should call out.\u201d Sick tomorrow \u2013 that\u2019s what he meant and that\u2019s when I knew, like he\u2019s turning this completely sexual right <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B1\">now. And I write, \u201cI can\u2019t since I\u2019m taking days off because my sister\u2019s coming I have a lot of clients today and tomorrow.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat a shame.\u201d Oh wait I\u2019m sorry that was this morning. So after what I said, \u201cI\u2019m not busy I\u2019m just giving you space\u2026\u201d My phone rings and he calls. He had nothing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B2\">to say, he was just quiet and saying \u201cI\u2019m in bed.\u201d He was sighing. I was like, well, do you have anything else to say? \u201cNo.\u201d And then it leads to phone sex.  And I can\u2019t believe I fell for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what did you\u2014what were you\u2014it sounds like you even knew that it was going to come. What were you feeling though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">CLIENT: He\u2019s told me before that that helps him feel more connected. So I was hoping, maybe if he felt more connected then he might feel open to talking. It\u2019s kind of like I need the opposite, I need communication and then when we can have sex. He needs sex and then we communicate. And I knew that it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">might not happen tonight but I was open to that. I was like okay at least we\u2019re communicating. And it was, it was like he didn\u2019t even need me to say much, he just needed me on the line. I felt like one of these, like 1-800 operators (LAUGHS), like he was just doing his own thing and just had me on the line. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah, was he just talking dirty to you? Or?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">CLIENT: Very little. Just not nearly what he normally says, just wishing that I was there with him and how much he misses me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: But it was sexual?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: It was a sexual thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: And then, I said: \u201cgood night.\u201d We said good night and then the next morning he calls he text me in the morning, \u201cI\u2019m getting ready for work you should call out.\u201d And my reaction is frustration because I\u2019m like okay, he\u2019s still being sexual now. Because he, he\u2019s not saying that so he can come <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">over and talk to me and so we can get together and get coffee and talk or something. I says, \u201cI can\u2019t since I\u2019m taking off I have a lot of clients.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat a shame, because I can think of a few things.\u201d And at that point, I really felt like saying, you expect me to drop everything just like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">that, when you haven\u2019t talked to me for a week. But again I didn\u2019t want him to pull away again. I wanted to keep him close because at least I have him talking to me. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t just drop everything. I have responsibilities.\u201d He said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d I said, \u201cI know your half-serious.\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B3\">he\u2019s like but you were up pretty late for someone with responsibility. And I go, \u201chow do you know how late I was up?\u201d And he writes, \u201cElf on the shelf. Have you heard of this? Elf on the shelf?\u201d And I said, \u201cthat freaks me out, how do you know I was up till 2:00 since I slept so much all weekend. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B4\">was depressed this weekend, so I slept a lot.\u201d Side story, before I continue. On Saturday or something like that, Friday, maybe I decided to make a \u2018tender\u2019 profile and first I started with just a picture, I think from me in the back sitting on a beach, so you can\u2019t even see my face. I did it basically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B5\">to stick my toe in the water and just see how it felt for me. And probably part of it was also to see if guys would talk to me. And they did, and\u2014just like \u201chello.\u201d I haven\u2019t even planned anything or gotten to know anybody but I, I feel like that was fine for me to do. I\u2019m not\u2014like if this is over with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B6\">Brian, I\u2019m not planning to date anyone seriously right away, but I don\u2019t think there was anything wrong with me doing that, so I did do that. Last night\u2014aft\u2014last night, yeah after talking to Brian and the phone sex and everything I went on my \u201ctender\u201d account and I turned off this option for discovery <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B7\">which means that no, new people can see you. So, I just said, I\u2019m putting that on hold until I figure this out, so that\u2019s what I did.  So, back to this, he says: \u201cElf on the Shelf.\u201d And then he writes me, so you got off on the phone with me and immediately went on \u201cTinder?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855954\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">THERAPIST: He said that?

Part of me also made the \u201cTinder\u201d account because I was looking for him. Sometimes when we have a fight, I go on \u201cOkay Cupid\u201d and I go temporarily on my old profile and check to see if he\u2019s reactivated. He hasn\u2019t. But then I said to myself, I wonder if he\u2019s on \u201ctender.\u201d So part <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F1\">of me was looking for him as well. So my immediate response is, \u201cknew it.\u201d And he writes, \u201cgoodbye doctor.\u201d I said \u201cI went on to shut the search option off, originally went on to see if you were on it and I was right.\u201d And he said, \u201cHa, ha I\u2019ve never used \u2018tender.\u2019\u201d Like, this frustrates me, like \u201cha, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F2\">ha\u201d caught you. When I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you\u2019re fucking married. \u201cI\u2019ve never used \u201ctender\u201d in my life but you liked it, search all you want. I\u2019ve never.\u201d I said, \u201cSo why that comment?\u201d \u201cNo more chit chat. I\u2019ll miss you terribly, but I\u2019m glad I found out.\u201d And I just went off, I said, \u201cGlad you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F3\">found out what? That I\u2019m making myself available to the possibility of meeting someone who wants a life with me? You haven\u2019t, yet addressed anything about the conflict we\u2019re having, the relationship is all on your terms\u2014all of it. And I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m not okay with that and want you to make a decision <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F4\">and you fled. You didn\u2019t like me demanding. The truth is that this relationship is okay as long as it\u2019s on your terms and I\u2019m not okay with that.\u201d  And then he writes back, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame really. You were only a few months away from getting, probably what you want.\u201d And at this point, I\u2019m like this guy <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F5\">is completely manipulating me.

And like the word, you \u201cprobably\u201d getting what you want. I said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to pursue something real with me, let me meet your son \u2013 OH, If you\u2019re not going to pursue something real with me, let me meet your son, move on from your marriage, then you\u2019re going to lose me. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200431\">going to move on \u2013 can\u2019t wait for you forever. You\u2019re acting like I cheated on you. I haven\u2019t even talked to anyone on there, yet.\u201d And he writes, \u201cI wish you the best. You\u2019re an amazing person and you have such a great life ahead of you. I\u2019m sad I won\u2019t see it, but I have wonderful faith that it\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200432\">be wonderful.\u201d  Being all-dramatic, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit, Brian. Run away like you always do. Don\u2019t you get it? If you don\u2019t step it up with me, you\u2019re going to lose me.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not running. I\u2019m sad.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t put this on me, like you caught me with a \u2018dick\u2019 in my mouth. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200433\">\u2018tender\u2019 I haven\u2019t broken any laws, stop trying to make me feel like I have. You haven\u2019t mentioned your marriage once. When I ask what you want? You say, you want to be happy. That\u2019s your chance to share your thoughts about what you want with me. Why wouldn\u2019t you share your thoughts about wanting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200434\">give me something that\u2019s only a few months away. That\u2019s the time you step up and tell me about that. And you don\u2019t, you leave me guessing, which is very unfair and then minutes pass, like ten, fifteen minutes \u2013 no answer \u2013 so I can be held accountable but you\u2019re not allowed to be held accountable. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200435\">so easy for you to deflect all the time and not look at your part in all this. Damn it, Brian I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this again, when we have a conflict and then silence from you.\u201d He just writes, \u201cYou can be mad at me. I accept that. Don\u2019t ever think that what I felt for you, wasn\u2019t real though, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200436\">it was, I promise.\u201d And I said, \u201cI can stay with you, a married man, but I get on \u2018Tinder\u2019 just get on, not even date or fuck someone and I\u2019m chastised. It makes real sense. See, all on your terms.\u201d And he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue. I don\u2019t want to be mean.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\u2019re being manipulative.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200437\">And he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not trying to get anything. I\u2019m not trying to take anything from you. I\u2019ve taken too much already. I feel awful. I feel guilty.\u201d And, meanwhile I still have access to his e-mail. He started being nice, so I texted him after that, like after a patient, I said, \u201cWhy do you say things <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200438\">to me like in a few months you would have gotten what you wanted.\u201d And he says, \u201cBecause that\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d And then I explained how, when you say those things it sounds manipulative because I haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s telling me you\u2019re going to end your marriage. I\u2019m not psychic. When <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200439\">you don\u2019t talk about certain things I assume you don\u2019t think about them. Do you want to meet me at lunch and talk?\u201d He says, \u201cNo I have a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry are you feeling sick? blah, blah, blah.\u201d He says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m asking him if he\u2019s feeling sick.\u201d I said, \u201cI still <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004310\">wanted you to meet my sister. I still wanted you to be my date for that September wedding and I still wanted us to live together.\u201d And then he just puts a smiley face and then later, \u201cso humid and rainy out.\u201d And just like small talk but eventually he writes, (PAUSE)  I said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t really talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004311\">last night. Are we going to talk about the conflict we\u2019re experiencing ever? Or is this done?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cHuh?\u201d And I said, \u201cI want to figure this out.\u201d And he goes, \u201cOkay\u2026?\u201d I say, \u201cDo you agree? Do you see what I mean when I say that you\u2019re sitting back acting normal with your wife. How do you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2004312\">expect me to believe that you\u2019re planning to leave her, when nothing has changed?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855954\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20045\">Mind you, at this point I have looked up his e-mail. There\u2019s all this like secrecy going on, but I had looked up his e-mail and the last e-mail is from his wife, this afternoon, like at 2:30 that says, remember I told you the vacation house they\u2019re looking at? it says: \u201cThe dates that are going <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200451\">to be booked are the 20th through the 30th so that means you should take the 29th and 30th off of work. Love you.\u201d So he\u2019s planning to go on vacation. She\u2019s telling him, \u201cI love you.\u201d Like, everything\u2019s normal between them. He doesn\u2019t know I know this, though. So when, after I say nothing has changed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200452\">his response is \u201cI\u2019m becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the way you seem to perceive me and the way you\u2019re talking to me.\u201d  And I write, \u201cYou\u2019re deflecting, you never answer the question. It\u2019s because you don\u2019t like anyone putting you on the spot.\u201d He says, \u201cBeing a psychologist must be so easy <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200453\">when you\u2019re psychic. Nice to be able to ask and answer all your own questions.\u201d So, I\u2019ll ask again, \u201cHow do you expect me to believe that you\u2019re planning to leave her, when nothing has changed? I\u2019m in the car, do you want to talk?\u201d He writes, \u201cI\u2019m with people right now.\u201d And then before getting here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200454\">I get the text, \u201cMake up sex?\u201d And I wrote, \u201cAnd talk?\u201d And he wrote, \u201c80, 20?\u201d And I said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re being funny?\u201d And that\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20049\">CLIENT: I\u2019m getting \u2013 I know what I should do. I should put my foot down and just say, this is bullshit, you\u2019re manipulating me, you\u2019re totally like just playing with me. You don\u2019t plan on doing anything.  And I need to protect myself and just walk away and I can\u2019t do that.

Like he doesn\u2019t communicate. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2004D1\">hasn\u2019t let you meet his son and it\u2019s nine months.

And when he said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling sad now,\u201d I thought you were getting at more of a\u2014it sounded like it was getting close to something and then, I was really struck by him wanting to turn it into sex right away. Almost as a way to\u2014for, for the both of you to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200631\">kind of hang on to something, because of a fear of this breaking apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20067\">THERAPIST: And, and I sense that there\u2019s something \u2013 that that is, it might be very difficult, not only for you, but for him to separate. Like it would be a very difficult thing for, for both of you\u2014not just you, but for him as well to separate. If that\u2019s\u2014and you know my sense is that that in a certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200671\">way this is, which I think also means that he\u2019s going to have a hard time separating from his wife too. That\u2019ll really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20069\">CLIENT: But he doesn\u2019t even talk about it\u2026like as far as I know, we\u2019re having a normal life and it makes me sick to my stomach like that, he makes me feel bad for demanding or for saying, like \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? I want to know.\u201d Or for even getting on \u2018tender\u2019 \u2013 meanwhile you\u2019re going on freaking vacation <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200691\">with your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that seemed to me, just like a way to kind of re-direct things a bit and get away from\u2014I think you\u2019re right I don\u2019t think he wants to answer the question and I don\u2019t think \u2013and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily because of manipulation as a much as a way I hear it is somebody who can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006B1\">reckon with something about what they might be feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006D\">CLIENT: So you don\u2019t hear it as manipulation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I like on the surface its manipulation in the sense of like, he\u2019s doing everything he can, not to talk about it, that\u2019s very clear. Like, you ask him a question, he\u2019s not going to answer it. My, my, my sense is that it\u2019s not \u2013 what I mean by, \u201cit doesn\u2019t sound manipulative,\u201d what I mean to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F1\">say by that is that it\u2019s not for some, it doesn\u2019t sound like maybe he\u2019s enjoys screwing with your head or he likes \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying that that might be some small facture, but more to that, there\u2019s something about you calling into question what he\u2019s really going to do, that confronts him with separation <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2006F2\">with either you or his wife, that I would imagine for him is really, really scary and frightening. I think in a way, he\u2019s almost saying, \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d I need to have both.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855954\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20071\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s why I need to walk away, because I\u2019m not going to be a \u201csister-wife.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20073\">THERAPIST: I mean at least right now. I mean, look the tricky thing is that you, you there\u2019s no \u2013 it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a good sense of that changing. I mean, you know to his credit there\u2019s a lot of men who will say, \u201cone more month, one more month.\u201d And will do, \u201cI\u2019ve got plans\u201d and then it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200731\">happen and you know, I don\u2019t even think that he can really go there with himself to entertain that possibility in a real way. At least the way I\u2019m hearing it and I guess the reason why I\u2019m saying all that is that\u2014well a couple of things, because one I\u2019m thinking about how agonizing that becomes for <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200732\">you. (PAUSE) Well, how \u2013 I mean how very complicated it must be then to feel like he\u2019s not saying \u201cno.\u201d He\u2019s just not saying, \u201cno\u201d to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20075\">CLIENT: Right 00:31:30}<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20077\">THERAPIST: And he\u2019s saying there\u2019s a chance and like that being very \u2013 that\u2019s just a powerful thing for anybody that really wants something and it\u2019s being very \u2013 very tantalizing in that way. It\u2019s a hard thing to kind of \u2013 you know? Walk away from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20079\">CLIENT: But you know what also, bothers me, the fact that I am \u2013 I still want him even though he\u2019s treating me this way. The silencing, the not being able to confront conflict, not being able to \u2013 you know the whole walking away from conflict. And the silent treatment that is so incredibly hurtful to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200791\">me. 00:32:19} Like, and I\u2019ve told him repeatedly. Like remember what he did to me over Christmas? Like, he knows I have like deep seeded issues with that. Like after I accused Billy of molesting me, he stopped talking to me for two months. We use to pass each other in the Kitchen to get breakfast and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200792\">he didn\u2019t say a word to me. When my father would just like stop calling, sometimes he\u2019d stop calling for like, a year. You know, I was in Middle School, High School, like to me that\u2019s worse than fighting with me and he knows that about me and he does it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Well maybe\u2014you know it does make me think about walking away from him, yourself though would be\u2014maybe you would be a lot of silence that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007D\">CLIENT: What do you mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Well I was just thinking about it would mean\u2014maybe you really experience a lot of loss?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20081\">CLIENT: That the thing, like when I was talking to my friend Penelope last week when I was in a really sad place, I said to her, like I know I should just text him and let him know I\u2019m not okay with this, I\u2019m walking away. And I\u2019m so scared to do that. It\u2019s almost like I feel this emptiness, like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200811\">withdrawal almost when I know, like that\u2019s it, it\u2019s finally cut off. Done. (PAUSE) But I know I would be able to go on, like look this weekend I thought he was never going to talk to me again and I felt myself getting stronger again. I\u2019m getting a headache.

You know, like I did a lot of thinking, I went out for walks. I saw a lot of people. I went to my friend\u2019s pool. I stopped by Carly \u2019s house and I said \u201cHi\u201d to her and then at night I met these other girls. Like I felt connected to people, not <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200891\">the same way I\u2019m connected to Brian. But I feel loved. I feel cared about. And even when I\u2019m by myself I try to soak in the isolation. Like I\u2019m walking around the reservoir and I\u2019m thinking to myself, wow, you\u2019re here by yourself. Would you be okay if, like Brian wasn\u2019t in your life and you just had <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200892\">the rest of the people your family, your friends. I mean, it\u2019s like I\u2019m talking to myself, like convincing myself, like no you\u2019d be okay, you\u2019d be okay and maybe one day you\u2019d find someone else. But there is something very powerful, like whenever he just, just that text that \u201cI miss you.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yes, I was thinking about that. It\u2019s that, yes right. It\u2019s not that \u2013 maybe it\u2019s not about being alone, but it\u2019s maybe like the power of that kind of love or that kind of having somebody\u2014having a man that really reaches out, misses you, knows\u2014that cares about you. Wants to be back in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2008B1\">life. That\u2019s very powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008D\">CLIENT: My dad never says, \u201cI miss you.\u201d Never. When he was drunk and I was little, I think like in his\u2014in his mess of drunkenness he\u2019d cry and hug me and say, like, \u201cOh your mother\u2019s trying to keep us apart\u2014I miss you so much.\u201d But any other time, like, I don\u2019t remember ever hearing that from my stepfather <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2008D1\">or father. (PAUSE) (SIGHS) I feel like he\u2019s fucking with my head. I know that\u2014I agree with you, like he\u2019s not doing this to be a manipulative con artist, you know? I know he has his own issues, but it\u2019s fucking with my head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yes it is. Because it\u2019s such a strong\u2014it\u2019s so strong. I mean it\u2019s just so damn strong. You get a bit of what you want but not the whole thing and sometimes you can feel\u2014as I\u2019d imagine sometimes it can feel like the whole thing and then it can be\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20091\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s so cruel for him to say something like, \u201cOh, goodbye forever because I caught you on \u2018Tinder.\u2019 And too bad you were only a few months away from getting what you want.\u201d That\u2019s like dangling something in front of an animal. (PAUSE)  And then I think about people I talk to, like my <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200911\">friend Carly and Penelope who I\u2019ve cried to like this. How are they going to react if I end up saying, \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re back together.\u201d Like I\u2019m going to be disappointed in myself, like unless he really steps up and shows me, that he wants a life with me, that he\u2019s not going to hurt me. That he really <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200912\">is invested in me. I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t just fall into the same pattern that we\u2019ve been in. I think he feels very stuck and I, also feel stuck. Because I can\u2019t keep away from him. (PAUSE)  If I confront him about the vacation, he\u2019s going to be so pissed. He probably won\u2019t talk to me for another week, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200913\">he\u2019s going to think I\u2019ve been snooping through his e-mails, which I have. And even if I didn\u2019t say anything and like come, the end of August when supposedly he\u2019s going on a trip. If I said, like, \u201cOh, can I see you this weekend?\u201d He\u2019d make some line up, \u201cOh I\u2019m teaching, I\u2019m traveling.\u201d And he does <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200914\">that supposedly because he doesn\u2019t want to hurt me, but those are the things I need to hear, so that I can walk away.

That in some way it\u2019s like if he, if you\u2019d say something like, I\u2019m going on a vacation with my wife and son. That might have a real different ring to it than, I\u2019m working. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20095\">CLIENT: Yes. I don\u2019t know what their life is like together. She\u2019s writing \u201clove you\u201d on the e-mails.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well he keeps\u2014I guess he keeps holding out the promise at least of somebody that really has you has you in mind first. I think that\u2019s, that\u2019s maybe what\u2019s so damn seductive and strong, because I think that\u2019s what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20099\">CLIENT: Say the first part again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s he got \u2013 that, that he holds out a kind of promise that really it\u2019s got you in mind first. You know, in some way it\u2019s not like he\u2019s talking to you about choices he\u2019s making. You know, you or her and really confronting the both of you, with that. It suggest it\u2019s not really happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009F\">THERAPIST: And so, in a way, what I\u2019m saying about that is it kind of \u2013 it, it sounds like it\u2019s another kind of tantalizing experience to go, Oh yeah it\u2019s really, you know he\u2019s got me in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A1\">CLIENT: I hope I stay with this anger because, I, I don\u2019t know if he will come over, but if he does I normally get very soft right away and I\u2019m gentle. And if I see that he\u2019s getting overwhelmed affectively, I\u2019ll back off but I don\u2019t want to. Like I want to push him on it. And I want a direct answer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200A11\">I want to know like, what\u2019s going on between you and your wife? Are you going to tell her about me? Are we going to live together like I want to?

He says, she wouldn\u2019t mind if he was in a relationship with someone, so as far as she knows he\u2019s probably just sleeping around, once in a while. And they probably have a normal life. And, no he\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200A51\">ready to make any big decisions and that\u2019s not going to happen and we\u2019re not going to live together. But it\u2019s like I need to hear it, in order to be able to walk away. I don\u2019t like that. I wish I could just walk away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it\u2019s very hard, very hard when it\u2019s so really kind of \u2013 I mean this could go on for a while.
