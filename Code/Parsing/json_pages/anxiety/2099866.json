But I'll figure it out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I used to do that, like in graduate school and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Tutor kids in high school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Kids with like ADD, and I worked with kids with ADD and learning disabilities, and some of my time at first in private practice as well.

They are, I think they want good grades but they don't really see the connection between getting good grades and working for them, and they just have a lot else going on in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">their lives that's way more fun. Which, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Stunningly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.

(pause) And you know, they're disorganized, but that's easy to fix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And how old are they?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: One's fifteen and one's seventeen. So like the seventeen-year-old is going to be applying to colleges next year, so she kind of wants to be there, because she, you know, really wants to bring her grades up. And the fifteen-year-old doesn't want to be there. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: But, like, I would never know if her dad didn't tell me that. Like, she's very... she's very polite about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Right. And you see them together? Are they sisters?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. They seem to get along very well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Um... (pause) I don't know. I'd present this, I would have each of them sort of set goals for how they want to do, like let the goals come from them about what they want their performance to be, and then sort of back into how much time it's going to take to get there, if they were like, \"Okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">you want to get, you know, four B's and an A. All right, and in which subjects? Okay, so how much time is this actually going to really take?\" You know, like, how are you going to have to do on the stuff coming up, if you want to do that well, how much studying do you think you're going to... You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200472\">like, back them, like, have them set their goals, and then kind of back them into the amount of time they need to study working on their stuff, and then like, schedule it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099866\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And they won't follow the schedules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Of course not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: But it's more like, at least that way you have some kind of (pause) you know vaguely, kind of jagged like, you have some sort of goal post to sort of relate what they're doing to. In other words, like, then when they come back and ask, and they say, \"Yeah, you know, I said I was going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">study like three hours a week, and I studied like an hour.\" \"Oh, okay. Well, like, what happened?\" You know, and you can kind of get into what's getting into the way, \"Well, I don't really care, because this other thing was more fun...\" You know, like you kind of can...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I've talked with them...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: There are really lots of other ways to go, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know, maybe so. Because I talked with them about, like, what their current goals are and what they want. (pause) But I haven't really made, kind of an explicit connection much between what they want and what I'm asking them to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I wouldn't ask them to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I would just, like, relate it to what, like, \"Well, if you want this, let's figure out what you actually need to do to get it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Right. Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Because you sort of want to keep the motivation in their court.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Because they're fifteen and seventeen, you know.

(chuckles) I'm like, \"Well, I'm going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200831\">ask your teachers.\" Because I'm pretty sure they're required to have some kind of schedule.

I mean, they may be, like... the behavior may be similar, but it sounds like they may... they may just not know, you know? They may just be more into having fun? In other words, like... (pause) I know because you've told me that you're sort of... your study habits weren't very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">good, especially at that age. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: But I would guess you were pretty motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah, they seem to me to be sort of just resigned to not doing very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: Like, they want to do well, but they kind of figure that they can't.

I kind of, like, get nervous and then talk a lot anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EB\">I would guess there's probably a lot of work tutoring for study skills, there seems to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200ED\">CLIENT: There's a lot of work what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Tutoring for study skills?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Um, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F3\">THERAPIST: I've tried it with ed, and it's not quite clear who's supposed to be doing that, you know, as opposed to, like content. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Um, yeah. Study skills and SAT prep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200F9\">CLIENT: So. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200FB\">Anyhow, I feel like it's, if that's something I can figure out how to tackle well, like, that'll be really good for me when I'm teaching.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D\">I remember I was working with this kid in tenth grade, like, the first kid I charged probably what I should be, and I remember sending a bill by e-mail, and anticipating that as soon as I pushed \"send,\" I was going to get this furious e-mail back, like, \"This isn't what we agreed on, how could you possibly <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2013D1\">be charging...\" You know, which of course was what we agreed on and we had talked about, and she didn't bat an eye.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20141\">THERAPIST: I was like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20143\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah.

I feel like both with tutoring and with applications and, you know, spending all my time acting like I really know what I'm doing, and it feels like there's no way anyone is going to believe me. (chuckles) There's no way. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20149\">CLIENT: I'm positive that the head of after school at all of these schools, you know, the person who's going to read my application if I'm lucky, knows for a fact that I don't know what I'm doing, but... (chuckles) (pause) Yeah, I mean, I'm sick of applying for jobs, but it's just not something I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201491\">very good at. I mean, I'm very good in print. Like my writing. I can sell myself pretty well. But (pause) I always feel like there's no way they're going to believe me.

So you just got out of college.\" I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2014D1\">like, \"Yep.\" (chuckles) Not much else to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2014C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2014C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099866\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">CLIENT: Um, yeah. (pause) And then, like, a couple weeks in, the head of my department watched a class period, and at the end of the period she said, \"You're doing really well, you're really on the right track. But you know, you can tell them to do things, right?\" (chuckles) She's like, \"You're asking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201511\">them to do things.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">Are you a little unprepared here because you don't know what to talk about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yes. (chuckles) Yes. Yeah, I'm just feeling really nervous. I can't tell whether it's either I don't know what to talk about here or whether that's just because, you know, I kind of [inaudible] a later one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">THERAPIST: What are some, like, your... things are current for you, and thoughts about things, but that they don't sound sort of prepared enough, or you feel like they're not important enough to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like (pause) yeah, it's like, I'm thinking about things, but it's kind of a combination of things I've already said, but I just think again, and (pause) things that don't seem to be coherent enough to say out loud. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">I'm not thinking about \"Friends.\" Do you see \"Friends\"? It's a great show. (chuckles) It's a show that I watched with James, and the ECT made me forget all of it, so, I've got to watch it again! (chuckles) Yeah. But it's one of those that like, sticks in your head. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">THERAPIST: And I gather that's not important enough to talk about?

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20169\">THERAPIST: Could it be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Um... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016D\">THERAPIST: You really don't know where it's going to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016F\">CLIENT: No, you're right. I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20171\">THERAPIST: I imagine it feels to you like you probably give me certain standards of like, it's got to be something new, it's got to be something fairly coherent, it's got to be something that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">CLIENT: Is not TV?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20175\">THERAPIST: It doesn't matter, it isn't TV.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah.

There's no reason why they shouldn't be doing well in school. You know, their parents are super supportive, as far as I can tell. I mean, I can't tell much, obviously, but like... (pause) You know. Their dad, we meet at, like, their dad's company. He has like, a little, like jet company <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201931\">or something. And so we meet in the conference room. And he'll like, come in and bring like, a little cup full of animal crackers, and be like, \"Here you go.\" And then...

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C5\">THERAPIST: You're probably like that with your tutoring too. Like, they put their trust in you, they're treating you well, they're paying you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I want to do right by them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause) It's hard to do either of those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that was (pause) honestly the thing that I, one of the things that I liked the most about teaching, is that (pause), you know, the first month of so is kind of up and down, you know, getting kind of into it. But by Thanksgiving, you know, I could tell that I deserved that. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CB1\">Yeah, that was really nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CD\">I mean, it was I sort of felt like I was getting away with a lot, because that would be that just everyone, all of the administration, I can't remember exactly what it was, but they were just really, really overworked about something. And so that time after like, two weeks, when somebody sat in on <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CD1\">my class was the only time that somebody sat in on my classes. (chuckles) Which was really not supposed to happen at all. Yeah, they were supposed to spend a lot more time making sure that I wasn't fucking up. But (pause) you know, I... (pause) I think it was sort of a case of, they could tell that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201CD2\">whatever I was doing, it was working. So, they just said, \"Well, we don't have to worry too much about Tanya.\" (chuckles) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099866\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">Yeah, this is the school that I've applied for an Aramaic teaching job. You know, it's that's what I really want. And there are a lot of things about that school that really bother me. Some of it is just stuff that goes on with independent schools, period. Like (pause) they're always going to be all <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF1\">snobs, like that's how it works. And I'm always going to feel like an outsider in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">And you know, with St. Margaret there's no, like, all girls, San Antonio thing that you've got. There are a lot of traditions that the feminist in me gets a little upset about. (chuckles) And the feminist in me is pretty large, so... (chuckles) But at the same I guess my point is, they really took <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201D11\">care of me. As a student, but more so even as a teacher than when I was a student there. That's not something that comes along that much. I'd like to be there again. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">Yeah, part of me wishes that I hadn't left when I did. But I think, yeah, but then I'd be across the country from James, and I didn't want that. Yeah. Yeah, even in retrospect I don't think I'd want that. Being (pause) the time I spent from Ohio to Denver. That just sucked. It sucked so much. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">I don't know if it would have been... weird looks. God, I've been in some weird places! (chuckles) It's so Catholic there! It's so Catholic! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">CLIENT: You know what I mean. Like, I'm Episcopalian, I can sort of fake it. You know, I know what people are talking about when they mention, like, sacramentality. But it's another world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.
