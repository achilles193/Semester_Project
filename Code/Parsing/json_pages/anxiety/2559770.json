(Pause) It's very frustrating because like the bus that would be easiest for me to take leaves like just too early and then by the time I get there it's like she just misses her bus and so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Our transportation sucks.

Yeah, I think I'm going to (inaudible), you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">know, it's really, really hard, but I also think (inaudible). My knees hurt in the same way that they do (inaudible).

I feel like that everywhere I go today, so it's just hot outside and (unclear) and dark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">(Pause): [00:03:35 00:03:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: My dad called last night to tell me, this is another like bitching about my dad, but he called to tell me that he was doing the baccalaureate service for (unclear) collegiate, which is the school that Jason went to, that I had applied for a position there this year and didn't get it. Obviously. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">So he was talking to the headmaster and the headmaster is like, 'you have a daughter, don't you?' And oh, yes, she applied for a job here. And like, her resume, it looked good, and blah, blah, blah. And then, he was like, 'yeah, we have a part time position open and I was thinking of her.' And my dad <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200432\">was like, 'oh, she'll definitely be in touch with you.' (Laughing) So he called me to tell me that and like it's one of those things that, like him trying to do right by me or help me out but actually puts me in a really awkward position because like, 'I think you should get in contact with him?' Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200433\">what am I going to say? Like, 'thanks for thinking of me for this position, but I'm not going to take it,' when you haven't actually told me you were thinking of me for the position?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559770\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Aw. Frustrated. Like it didn't occur to my dad that I just started a new job. Like I have a job now. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Talking about it to James it devolved into this awkward thing like I think it was I was upset about it and I think it was the sort of thing that he was talking about when he said he didn't feel like that he needed to not be my only supporter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: But he asked me what was wrong so I told him and so I feel like then both of us were kind of were in the situation where I was telling him what was wrong and he was supporting me and neither of us really wanted to be there. (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: And really, I would have been perfectly willing to nurse this in silence, like that would be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">(Pause): [00:06:40 00:06:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I guess it's just a pattern that's going to be hard for us to get out of, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">(Pause): [00:07:04 00:07:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I feel like I should get out of the pattern of telling anybody these small things.

What? (Laughs) I don't need to I feel like, well I don't need to tell anybody about it. I just should not tell anybody about it. (Whispers) But I talk about it. That's all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">(Pause): [00:08:25 00:08:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">(Pause): [00:08:35 00:08:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I smiled because you said well there's no puzzle to be solved, like as though that's why -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Why I should just not tell anybody about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: No. Why one would tell somebody about something like there's a puzzle to be solved, let's like talk about it and solve it. But I don't think that's the main thing, like at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that sort of is, I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">(Pause): [00:09:11 00:09:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: I feel like why else should I tell people and you know, my dad says something that irritates me but (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: I mean, and I know that there are other valid reasons but it's just, that's what I think. That's what -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">(Pause): [00:09:17 00:10:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You know, one thing is that I think the reason it irritated you is because he actually hadn't really taken the thought of your having a job and what that meant to you and something characteristic about how he tried to help but his obliviousness made it sort of the opposite. Sort of in a neglectful <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">kind of way not just like it's something he could have known but didn't know. You know? I'm sure somebody told him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: I mean, no I told him I had a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Every time we've talked for the last three weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: And I guess, you know, it hurts that he didn't pay attention or he didn't take in what you said. I bring that up because I imagine it's kind of the opposite about why you want to tell people, so they know so they take it in. So they can kind of account for where you're at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">(Pause): [00:11:45 00:12:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: I guess that's what I mean about (unclear) patterns of behavior with James. But like I just because I when I'm upset and I tell him why I'm upset, that doesn't mean he needs to do anything about it. But I think both of us sort of expect him to try to fix it. Even though that's not actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200891\">what either of us want at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559770\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">(Pause): [00:12:43 00:13:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: I feel like I'm not communicating very well today. Like I'm getting frustrated with myself and I don't know why. It's not always clear why, but it's just not being able to say exactly what I mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">(Pause): [00:13:44 00:13:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: It must be due to a lot of frustration in that case. (Unclear) you never say exactly what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">(Pause): [00:14:07 00:15:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: I wonder if (Pause) some of it is due to feeling worried or ambivalent about saying what you mean in the way that sort of emphasizes like (unclear) aspects of it or is kind of bid for connecting around what it was like instead of what could be done or figured out. In other words, I know James <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">is kind of like this and but I wonder if you pull for the little bit to like I'm not sure I'm saying like I'm proving this, but like before when you mentioned what your dad did, I think one thing you said it put you in an awkward situation which it did. But I don't know somehow you did say other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200952\">things, you said like, you said, \"It didn't seem to register that you had a job.\" But that seems closer to the emotional part. I think there's some way you let off the claim of the awkward situation that maybe you said you didn't know what to do. I think there was some of both in there but sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200953\">there's like a sort of you know, 'I don't know what to do, or how to handle it or what do I do kind,' of side that I can imagine (unclear) sometimes but a more problem-solving response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: I feel like I said, \"it put me in an awkward situation,\" pretty much first and then I was saying what could happen. That wasn't necessarily that wasn't really at all the most important part of it. More like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And like what was important about that was like the feeling of awkwardness, not the uncertainty of how to handle it. Like you're giving me this piece to care about that you're kind of annoyed with your dad and hurt. And it felt like, again, he tried to help make things worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then I feel like I'm not grateful enough for the help. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">(Pause): [00:18:19 00:18:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: That makes sense. And I really don't know how to handle it and that is (Pause) causing me stress, but I think the thing that was most hurtful was that he didn't remember that I had a job or if he did he didn't think it was a job that was important enough to not quit abruptly for a better one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">(Pause): [00:18:56 00:19:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">CLIENT: I don't know whether this is just in talking to you or whether it's in talking to most people, I expect in talking to most people, but I feel like it's much easier to say it as a 'I don't know how to handle this problem.' And I don't know how to handle these emotions or I have these emotions <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">but did you ever see, \"Anchorman\"?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">THERAPIST: A while ago, yeah.
