I don\u2019t remember where we left off. I think I was just talking about Chris\u2019s influences on my thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(PAUSE): [00:02:41 \u2013 00:03:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what else to say about it. I only know I have to do my own thinking. There is no substitute for that. But it\u2019s been kind of nice guess to have had him to talk to and like formulate ideas with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(PAUSE): [00:04:14 \u2013 00:04:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes like when I\u2019m thinking of what I want my future to be like I will only just imagine him, his presence like talking to him and meeting with him but there, I don\u2019t know, there isn\u2019t any romance in that picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I think I see us sharing like because we\u2019ve already done that for a long time so I can see the future like that extending with us talking and cooking and watching films together, but I kind of cringe or feel queasy when I think of it if romance enters the picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Between the two of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s not like there are moments when there aren\u2019t moments of affection, like physical affection. But like I don\u2019t know, I feel like I have to open that can of worms called my sexuality. I feel it\u2019s also, like everything else, very complicated. I used to think it was complicated as long <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">as (unclear) complicated and then I met this guy and it\u2019s like it\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s very carnal.

I don\u2019t desire him physically. So I feel like what\u2019s wrong with me. Why can\u2019t I be that way? Why can\u2019t I just fix it, take a pill or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(PAUSE): [00:07:48 \u2013 00:09:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: (inaudible due to external street noise)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: (Unclear) make me want to have sex with him.

I don\u2019t feel the need for it. I feel like I can do it on my own. Or not on my own then take (unclear) from everyone except him or you know, at first, but take his help as long as he would be a part of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">collective and not just the only person that I can reach out to.

Two or three summers we\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">gone to Nepal, together, separately, we\u2019re taking those trips together. But even then it\u2019s like we didn\u2019t really like sit down and talk about stuff, you know?

It\u2019s so stifling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">for me. Like I lost my independence and it\u2019s boring and all.\u2019 So, you know? I feel like I should be like that at my age. Pretty soon I should be like that looking for stability and not like not (unclear) and I feel like I\u2019m missing that because of my sexuality. You know because everyone says, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF2\">\u2018sex isn\u2019t everything.\u2019 Like all the other things matter and I\u2019m like, yeah, you know, maybe if I had all my wits about me and I wasn\u2019t in a stupid phase or I wasn\u2019t all hormonal, I would be \u2013 I mean look at this guy. He\u2019s not an intellectual. He makes money and he\u2019s not very political or concerned <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF3\">about social issues. So I would totally like not even be friends with him. I feel like I ignored all that because I was attracted to him. So now I\u2019m like (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019re being a silly adolescent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just like throwing my life away, the life I so carefully and painstakingly built with Chris. Because you know he\u2019s the right guy, the right guy, you know, this \u2013 so it means political, he\u2019s concerned with social issues, he\u2019s an academic, he\u2019s an intellectual. He\u2019s got good taste. He comes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">from a decent family. He\u2019s kind and above everything, he loves me.

I stepped away from it because I\u2019ve lost sight of myself.\u2019 All I could see was him and I forgot what my dream was or I (unclear) but like I had to make myself a priority. And once I did that I really like what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: And it becomes very selfish I feel like, this narrative and I don\u2019t like that everything\u2019s about me and like you know it\u2019s like a corporation or something like that. Like okay, so you want x done so you\u2019re going to go to the market and get the best. Like you said, oh my drains are clogged so <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">you\u2019re going to go and get the best material from the market \u2013 not something that you feel affection towards or something your friend made at home.

It\u2019s the function they serve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019re not getting your needs met from a person. You\u2019re getting your needs met by material. This person serves this function. This person \u2013 it\u2019s no longer about the other person. It\u2019s about the function they serve for you in a very sort of narrow sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Well, let me ask it in reverse. Why would looking for someone who fulfills needs be transactional? What about that is transactional?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">(PAUSE): [00:30:33 \u2013 00:30:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It feels base. There is an aspect of selfishness about it as opposed to selflessness. I don\u2019t know, it feels very direct and very \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">(PAUSE): [00:31:31 \u2013 00:31:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: I guess I feel that way in everything. I mean, in every other context of a relationship. Like when my mom would ask for rent or something or feel like everything else is out the window. It\u2019s just about this. The taking of my money and all affection would go away from that moment. It was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">a small moment but just the feeling of that moment would be like a stinky blanket covered everything else for days and days. And like yeah, asking Chris for things or like going out on dates and having guys pay for you and that also felt transactional. I don\u2019t know. I hate like money matters and like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D92\">stuff. I hate when money comes into the picture. It\u2019s like it always debases things. One time my dad said to me like (inaudible) he was trying to get me admitted into this school and the schools in Nepal in some places they ask for a donation. So he paid the donation and it wasn\u2019t that much compared <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D93\">to like the donation my dad\u2019s brother paid for his daughter \u2013 like 10, 20 times in comparison. But anyways, I remember my dad like lying on the bed and like saying, you are very expensive. You just take so much, you know. And I remember when I was like 13 or so and I was like internally laughing because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D94\">I was aware of that narrative that it was my mom always taking care of me and he wasn\u2019t even there to take care of me or us, you know, like monetary. And so the first time he did it I told it right back. But I also felt like horrible about myself, like I\u2019m a great burden to my parents. I always knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D95\">I was. I was told I was, like an emotional burden, but it was like at that moment it was like clear that like all of my 13 years I have been a financial burden as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561096\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Would your mom tell you that? That you were an emotional burden?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: No. Nothing like that but I think as recently as two years ago she would have that narrative, like her marriage ruined and everything and so. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s like subconsciously behind stuff right now when money comes into the picture or like people are like paying for my dinner or something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">maybe it\u2019s there very quietly, me feeling like a burden. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related to me in those transactions, but like it feels base to think in those terms. Is that what you meant? Like, why do I think in terms of needs or?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: In terms of transactions and needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: As opposed to how would I think \u2013 like desire or connection?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Connection, value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: You know that moment you described the \u2018dirty blanket cover,\u2019 if you feel in that moment that the only reason you have value for your mother is that you give her money for the rent, that\u2019s a transaction. If you feel that, A) she would be okay if you didn\u2019t give her the money; she would still <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">feel the same about you and that giving the money in the context of a much larger relationship and connection between you two, it\u2019s not a transaction. A transaction is you only exist in that moment for that transaction that\u2019s occurring and that\u2019s all you are to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Actually, what\u2019s worse is the fact that when you described all that I could clearly see my uncles writing her checks \u2013 her brothers, and like for years and years I feel like my dad would just hound her \u2013 this was in Nepal and he (unclear), but he would hound her to write to them and ask them <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">for money and she would absolutely hate it. Like that was the one thing that she hated the most to be a burden on her brothers. I mean their doctors here and are relatively well off but that was the most debasing moment. And I witnessed them writing a check and giving it to her and that\u2019s when the whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E92\">matter of the victim\/martyr and everything was acutely very, very that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Do you feel they experience it as a burden? Are they resentful about giving her money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Well, if they are they\u2019re not emotional. They\u2019re not affectionate. They don\u2019t really call that often and speak to us lovingly about what they\u2019re going through. It\u2019s always like a quick check up. Are you still there or not? Or at least that\u2019s what our dad would tell us too. Look they don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">care about you, but they just call to make sure you\u2019re still alive or whatever. Just because it\u2019s like their guilt, or whatever. All negative stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s a transaction, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Like someone calling just to make sure you\u2019re alive, not because of sort of brotherly or sisterly love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. And like my mom has consciously or maybe not so consciously tried to change that. Like she calls them on festivals and holidays and birthdays and they try and do that a little bit. But yeah I really don\u2019t want them to give us money anymore and they haven\u2019t for years, which is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561096\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Does she have two brothers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: They both live here?

I thought it was not general. I thought physician meant -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: No, usually physician is just basically the same word for a doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: Okay. I thought it was not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Do you think that she felt \u2013 how did she feel about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: She has different narratives. Sometimes she would say \u2013 like she\u2019s always telling the story that like so when the older brother \u2013 older as in like \u2013 they\u2019re both younger than her but amongst each other, but when he was sitting for medical exams she sat with him or something like that but didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201171\">pass by like two or three marks and then she sat again and then she would have sat a third time and her score kept increasing but she didn\u2019t sit a third time because she didn\u2019t want to compete with her youngest brother so \u2013 There\u2019s that narrative that, \u2018oh, I had to give up stuff,\u2019 which is probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201172\">not that untrue because like in Nepal, you know, women do have to take a seat back for their brothers and whatever, so. And then she\u2019s like, I used to draw all these diagrams and I would help him with his homework and so there\u2019s that and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: The scorned tutor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah.
