Come on in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Good morning. (long pause)  I feel so much lighter now. (pause) Yesterday I saw you and then I went to our last meeting of Danielle\u2019s work. It was like a love fest.  There are two meditation halls, upstairs and downstairs, and those were both occupied because there were two other practice groups <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">that are just starting, so our group met in the tea room, which is like, I imagine in that house where the hosts, the people who live there, would receive guests. It\u2019s like the first room to the right in this huge Victorian house. It\u2019s a very small room and then there is tea in there and mugs and a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">hot water thing.  There are a couple of couches and there is a reclining [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:08). So we met in that room. There were five people: the annoying post doc writer woman didn\u2019t come, which made it all the more (chuckles) of a love fest. So there were five of us and Danielle. We were so <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">close to each other. It would be like fitting five people in half of this room. (pause) We talked about this at the end.  There is something about Danielle\u2019s mom\u2019s death and the way that she really shared it with us and was so open about it and the timing of it and just the way that Danielle experienced <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">herself with us with her mom\u2019s death that set the tone for the next five weeks of our [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:34). That was really quite different from what any of us had ever experienced. There was Danielle; there was this woman who is probably in her 60\u2019s, a lovely school teacher.  There is Olive, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">who is probably my age, who seems to have a different set of work struggles. There is Julie, who is proudly also in her 60\u2019s, who looks like she\u2019s been through two wars and drug addiction and she\u2019s a gardener. She has long, grey hair, really wind burned-looking skin. She talks softly and in a deep voice. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">She laughs a lot, big belly laughs. Then there is the guy whose name I never knew, who is this overweight, sort of flamboyant gay guy.  [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:03) Those are the people and Danielle. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">It was very sad that the group was ending. It helped all of us and she invited me again to have an interview, which I printed up before she invited me again. It felt really nice to sit so close to everybody because in the big meditation hall, we were kind of spread out.  (pause) It\u2019s kind of like group <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">therapy, meditation style. That\u2019s how it felt yesterday, where no one is really the therapist \u2013 or like we all are. (pause) It was very intimate. (pause)  People seemed to genuinely get a lot out of the class, so we shared that with each other and I was surprised by how much [the air] (ph?) around my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">work came up week after week for me. I was able to articulate that a little bit last night. (long pause)  [Darla] (ph?) is going to see if she can get somebody in the [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:33), a meditation teacher who lives in Virginia, to come to my grandfather\u2019s house. Wouldn\u2019t that be cool? I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">want to try to make that happen for her. I think it\u2019s hard to go at it completely alone. (pause) You\u2019re not completely alone, but I imagine it must be hard to feel like you have any kind of stillness or any kind of confidence in the method or in the journey when so much is coming up.  But maybe that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">the difference between being 89 and being young and starting meditation. Maybe he has had all the years he needs to have stillness and now things are flowing differently and maybe he can hold it. [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:31) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20012-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562306\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">THERAPIST: When you were talking about it, it seems to me, it sounds like some of the stuff we\u2019ve been talking about in the sense that I don\u2019t think what you\u2019re referring to as being difficult to deal with on its own is the meditation, per se, it\u2019s what comes up, the stuff. I think in ways you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200151\">plenty about having to do that kind of stuff very much on your own. Then more recently, I think you have been involving other people, which I think is part of what you were saying was nice yesterday, both here and in the meditation group.  As far as you and me, it seems like something we\u2019ve been talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200152\">a lot about is the [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:12) that go along with when you feel more on your own with it versus when you feel more like I know or that we\u2019re connected in what you\u2019re talking about. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">CLIENT: Sometimes I do know what it\u2019s like to feel completely alone with what comes up, but I know that I wouldn\u2019t have . . .  I don\u2019t know; maybe I have no idea. It feels as if part of my resolve and commitment and love for the practice is supported by the fact that I can go and be around other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">who are also alone with the stuff that comes up for them and where there is this sort of shared honoring of what comes up here and there. That\u2019s very powerful. It\u2019s very powerful to have somebody else honor what came up for you, even if you\u2019re still left with it, right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: And I think it\u2019s very isolating and painful when it feels like people aren\u2019t. I\u2019m thinking about some of the more negative stuff that we were talking about yesterday, actually. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: Like how sometimes it feels like you weren\u2019t honoring by what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Like by doing what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Not being available, mostly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I felt this really strong resistance come up against the words appropriate and inappropriate, here and after I left here yesterday. Like how sure he is that it\u2019s not appropriate for us to talk between sessions.  Very. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: I knew that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: You didn\u2019t say it. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I was like \u201cwho is this Mr. Appropriate anyway? Why do we care about him?\u201d I started to soften into it, like we might need him \u2013 \u201cwe,\u201d like humans might need him \u2013 to not completely hurt each other and dissolve some systems that are actually doing a lot of good, like Western psychotherapy.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">People wouldn\u2019t come to you if Mr. Appropriate wasn\u2019t part of the relationship. And like the system of marriage. There is a lot of good in our world. (pause) It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m sacrificing my local short-term \u2013 it doesn\u2019t feel very short term, but in the grand scheme of one life \u2013 local, short-term <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">fantasies for some more global, more lasting, more helpful cause.  But it\u2019s like I really don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t have much choice, so it\u2019s convenient and the resistance comes back really fast. That\u2019s the theory that kept coming up when I felt like fighting the appropriateness hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562306\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">It\u2019s kind of like what Jeremy and I have talked about or when I brought up having sex with other people. It\u2019s actually like we both support that idea, especially for me where it feels really important that I experience somebody else.  But in practice, without being morally righteous or being anything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">it\u2019s actually a terrible idea. It can get really, really, really messy really fast; and that\u2019s not the part of the sex that I really want. It kind of feels like that, but it\u2019s like I still want it. (long pause)  I\u2019ve sort of talked about those two things as if they aren\u2019t related, but they\u2019re pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">related. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Like in a way, a different role for Mr. Appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Which I doubt [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:02) much more like practical than moral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes. I think there is nothing immoral about pursuing love in isolation. (pause) Sex isn\u2019t love, but if the intention is love, it gets pretty messy pretty fast.  That was a non sequitur. I guess it\u2019s pretty hard to say in words. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m trying to say. (scoffs) It gets pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">messy pretty fast trying to talk about it. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re anxious just about telling me. I imagine because you worry that I wouldn\u2019t really get it or appreciate it or I would start talking about how this is a way of avoiding feeling bad or something like that, rather than just what you want to say and the positive things that you feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m afraid of sounding amoral to you or kind of cuckoo. (laughs) I\u2019m sure nobody ever feels that when they\u2019re talking to you. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: No, never.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: If I feel like I\u2019m connecting with in in every way possible, what are the reasons not to do it? The only important reason to me is whether you want to or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: The other reasons just seem like flimsy little gates or flimsy walls that I could just punch down.  It feels much more violent than that, like completely destroy, like burn down Mr. Appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: We have five minutes. Why don\u2019t we just stop right at 10:30?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Okay. Are you anxious that I\u2019m not going to . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Are you going to try to stomp down that wall? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Uh-huh. (long pause)  I can\u2019t act in isolation. My actions affect other people. They affect my future. They affect your future. [Your actions affect your future.] (ph?) I guess I\u2019ve never had such a long, lasting, what feels like a very deep conflict between what I want to do and what I am doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">\u2013 how I want to act and how I\u2019m acting.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really had much distance between those two \u2013 ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: [It sounds like you\u2019ve been pretty convinced that the distance wouldn\u2019t have remained here either.] (ph?)
