I had to settle for Levi's (ph) today. [It's good] (ph). I got a lot done this morning. So, yeah, last night, I stayed over at Uma's hotel last night. It was good. It was a little (pause) there was a brief moment where I could tell, like, she really wanted to get jiggy with it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">but I, yeah, I just I don't know, man. I wasn't I just wanted (laughter) to go to sleep, kind of. And I felt nice, to be with her, but I just didn't, you know. I don't know. But she wasn't I mean, we didn't even it wasn't weird or anything. I just felt a little like, \"Ah,\" because I'm so not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">like that usually. I felt bad kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">But it was fine, you know. Of course, I slept pretty well, but I still have crazy dreams that now I can't remember, but woke up tired. I think I'm not just like, I'm not negating any of the stuff. I really do think though that I should have this sleep apnea thing looked at. I just wonder if sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">there's just, you know. I just wake up really tired, you know. And, you know, I know it's not, like, awful. They were like it's kind of, like, mild, you know. But, I mean, I'd rather, you know. Except I wonder if that would make a difference, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Are you waking up wet (ph) at night, that you know about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Well, that I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: But not to the point you're [crosstalk 01:49].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: When I did the sleep study, they said that I yeah, I was. I was, like, holding my breath or whatever happens, yeah. But they said that it was mild, so they weren't like, \"You definitely need this machine,\" or whatever, but they were like, you know, it's there, you know. So... I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">I can't, you know. On the one hand, I'm sleeping better, in a way, because I'm happier, but then I do have these days where I do wake up, you know, just not feeling rested, you know. And then I do you remember, like, I've said there have been some days where I just fucking crash, like, at 5:00 or, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">like, you know. But I can't tell because not every day is like that, you know what I mean? So I don't it's some days I'm snoring more than others. I don't know, you know. So, I don't know. Maybe I'll try to I know there are always different kinds of mouth guards that move your jaw or whatever. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">don't know. Maybe I need to invest in something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Are you still staying up some nights very late?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Okay, because that's where I would start. (Laughter) If you're going to give yourself a treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well, but, like, last night it wasn't that late. I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: But that might be when you finally were actually I mean, it's possible you're relaxing and finally getting some sleep means you're aware of how sleep deprived you are all the time. That can happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh, I see what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 03:17) when your body finally actually gets more sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: That's true, and I have read that people do tend to snore more when they're tired. Or, like, if you drink, you snore more. If you're exhausted, you snore more. If you eat late at night, you score you score more. You snore more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: All those things have healthcare (ph) effect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560568\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 03:39) effect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don't know. I think, yeah. (Pause) But anyway, but yeah. So it was good. I mean, I, you know. We had a fun night. It was cool. She's awesome. I don't know what to make of anything, but she's awesome, you know. The morning was nice, you know. I had a little breakfast and stuff. The thing I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">can't ignore though is I felt great [she left] (ph). (Laughter) I was like, \"Ah, okay. I can get back to my,\" you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Did you want to be hanging out with her? Like, was that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Is that something you wanted to do? Could you feel yourself being happy to be around her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I mean, we really, like, get along really well. I guess some of it's what I was talking to you about. The other thing is I think because we (ph) have this totally different mindset, I don't get super excited about dating someone, I've noticed. You know what I mean? Part of that scares <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">me, because I worry that I still have not let go on some level of, like, the Samantha, Meredith. Like, that arch type? That type, you know what I mean? And, I mean, Uma's really cute. She dresses really cool. And I mean, she has the checklist. A lot of it's there. (Pause) I'm just an asshole, you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">what I mean? Like, I'm just, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: No, [I don't know] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Like, you know, she has freckles. I mean, she's pretty, but she's not that, like, porcelain, like, just smooth skin kind of like, that's, I mean, it's insanity. I mean, she's a pretty girl, you know. She's petite, you know. She dresses cool. She's thin, you know. I mean, you know. So I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">know if (inaudible 05:39) I haven't let go of things in the past. I don't know if some of it's that I'm just in a much healthier place, so I'm just not quick to just say, \"Oh, I'm in love with,\" you know. But I don't know. So it's all new to me. I don't know. Like, remember that girl in San Diego? I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">came back and I was like, \"I think I'm going to marry this girl.\" Remember? So, no I wasn't, you know. I mean, she was really cool. I mean, I wish I didn't end that. I wish I'd dated her a little bit more. But, you know, that whole kind of overly quick, you know, that just doesn't happen anymore. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B3\">you know what I mean? It's like I don't know what to make of that space. Like, I really like her. But I don't know. I don't want to say I could take it or leave it, because I do really like her, but I don't know. Just, I was excited to go to Brown bookstore and pick up my psychology books that I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B4\">on hold and print out my posters for the show and come here, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It's funny because it doesn't it keeps sounding like you're about to say something that's more like \"I could take it or leave it\" that's very blas , but it doesn't then when I say, like, \"What do you feel?\" you're not saying it's blas , that you don't feel anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: You like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: [You're enjoying] (ph) her company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just don't feel, you know it's not that thing I've come in here telling you about. That's what -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: But I think that's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: It's probably healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: It's like you don't know what to do with that. What is it, you know, that's in between being madly in love and being totally indifferent.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560568\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: You just like somebody. You enjoy spending time with them, you know. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Or even, what is it like, it's new for you to have wanting to spend time with her not then trump everything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: So, yes, you want to go to the Brown bookstore and read about things that are professional (inaudible 07:41), but that's existing alongside -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Right, right. Or that I can be with someone and it doesn't have to be some fucking passion festival, you know what I mean. But yeah, I just don't know what it's like my mind doesn't have the capacity yet to understand, like it's like, well does that mean you just like her as a friend? Or, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">like, what? Wow. Like, you're not that turned on. What's going on? Like, maybe you're just not that into her, you know. It's all these things, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, it's a question that you're trying to figure out. What does this mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's a deeper thing. I don't think it's a superficial thing. I think it's deeper because there's something going on, where, you know, she's definitely, definitely not less attractive than chicks I've been hooking up with, you know what I mean? She's equally attractive probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">more attractive. So there's something deeper about, like I've just gotten so used to thinking of sex a certain way. I don't know. Possibly. I don't know. Yeah, I think there's deeper things going on, you know. But here's what I'm happy out. Hung out. No anxiety whatsoever. No awkwardness whatsoever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">Last night she took me to a show. I didn't really if it was up to me, I wouldn't have gone. She wanted to go. She's come all the way here, you know. And she was totally cool about it. I was like, \"You know, let's go. I don't go to shows. (inaudible 09:20) Let's go to a show.\" It wasn't my kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B3\">show, per se, but I had a fun time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">And on top of that, at the door, my little pill box thing with my little Ativan and Propranolol, they were seriously frisking people, which was odd. I never I mean, we weren't going to a club, dance club, whatever. But then I remember those people that died recently. And this was at Royale, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">is a dance club, so maybe they're just doing that to everybody, regardless. So for the first time in my life I've been carrying this thing around since I've been 25 or 26. He's like, \"What's this?\" You know, I took it out, and he, like, opened it. And I'm like, you know, those are prescription. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">they're just, like, anxiety things and that's an Advil. (Laughter) There was an Advil in there. A Tagamet heartburn thing. My two Propranolols, an aspirin, and an Ativan. Prepared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">He's like, \"Do you have a prescription?\" I was like, \"Well, yeah. I mean, of course I have a prescription, but I don't walk around with it.\" So he's, like, checking that (ph). He's like, \"Can you take that?\" I was like, \"Dude, you know you can just throw it away if you want.\" He's like, \"I mean, is <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">that all right?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, just toss it. I mean, you know, if I can't keep it, then fuck it,\" you know. So then Uma's like, \"What? No.\" And she's like, \"That's, like, your stuff.\" I'm like, \"No, I'm fine.\" But I was it's a little thing, but not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: It's a huge thing. (Laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Right? Boom. That was huge, yeah. I was totally fine. I was fine being in a big place with a lot of people. A lot of, like, annoying people, quite honestly, at a show that wasn't particularly good. But it was fun. Like, I was just making fun of them. I was making her laugh. I only had two beers. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">Then we ran into my good friend Stephen and his two friends. We went to a bar[for one more] (ph). It was totally nice, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560568\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: You relaxed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was fine. I was totally fine. Now, I went today and I got another pill box. (Laughter) But, just, you know, smoked (ph) my little buddy. Oh, that was the funny thing. When he opened it, I kind of almost laughed, because I don't take them, right. So they just sit there, and they almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">you know what I mean? Like, they get old. And so (laughter) I was like, \"Dude, just toss it, man.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">So that was cool. And then we went back to her hotel. I didn't have any trouble sleeping or you know, I felt tired. I was ready to sleep, you know. It felt nice to be in a nice I mean, I have a tiny bed, you know. So one of those huge hotel comfy beds, oh man, it was awesome. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Sounds like you might have slept well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: I mean, overall, I did. Yeah. I mean, I [did see] (ph) crazy dreams, but (pause) one dream, I do remember. I saw, like, maybe two days. Three this week, I saw. Where in my house, in my apartment, the electricity went off, but not completely off. And then there was, like, wires or duct work <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D1\">or whatever. I don't know if that was subliminally or subconsciously because I had put my electric bill to pay, you know. Because remember the fucking thing got shut off. So I don't know if it was just that or whatever. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: What were you feeling in the dream? Do you remember what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: A panicking, a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: It was anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: But then I was like, \"Oh, no. But there's still some light.\" So then I was like, but then I didn't understand why some were working and some weren't, you know. (Pause) I saw this other dream once too. I don't know if I bought it up here. Like, I don't really remember. It suddenly just popped <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">into my mind, but it was my house, but it wasn't my house. There were, like, other people living there or something. I don't know. It was weird. It was almost like a big farmhouse, something like that. Then there were people around the house, looking at it. Or they were neighbors. And it was a whacky <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">dream. I [still have] (ph) a lot of vivid dreams. Like, they're not particularly scary. They're just (pause) unusual. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: I think that means you're sleeping well or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I've read that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 13:55)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I've read that, yeah. Yeah, regardless of whether it's a good dream or not. But if they're vivid dreams, then that means you're in a deep state of sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I mean, there are whole theories about dreaming, actually, as a barrier that protects yourself from waking up while your brain is processing what it's processing.

[That you've] (ph) -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: You're into that REM sleep or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Right.

(Pause) I don't know. I just feel grateful right now. I feel like things are I'd like things to be like this for (laughter) you know what I mean? Like, even with my grandmother, things seem somehow they can't be better, possibly, but something's going on. I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">Maybe she's just gotten I don't know if it happens that people like that somehow on some level accept what's happening to them, even if they're not you know what I mean? She just seems lately like she's more like, you know that crazy aunt is finally here, hanging out. So, you know. It's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200892\">you know, hanging out with I walked downstairs. I bought Cecelia down so they could, you know. They love Cecelia, and they're hanging out. And my grandmother loves Cecelia now too. I don't know what that means, why she was before, she was, like, kind of kicking her and stuff like that.

Where are they?\" Like, she's such, like, a little girl now, it's almost like it's both heartbreaking, but it's kind of awesome in a way, you know what I mean? Like, she's not she's with us, you know. And she still has a sense of humor, you know. It's unbelievable. (Laughter) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B2\">But yeah, so it's nice. Like, I don't know.

I mean, she was in the hospital, definitely. She was okay, but if we had left her there, it was going to be what it used you know, she was definitely going to want to get the fuck out of there. But otherwise, she seems to be a little more something. I don't know. I mean, it also <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">could be (ph) she's just not as strong as she you know what I mean? She's literally, just in the last few months, she suddenly seems way more frail, you know. So by default, that's, I think, making her more mellow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">And my aunt seems okay. I don't know. She's a nut job, but she seems she hasn't said anything too crazy. (Pause) But, you know, again, what's great about all this is it just kind of doesn't matter (laughter) anymore (ph). I go down there and say hi to them. I want to see them. I want to, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">But then, you know, I just leave, you know. And Cecelia's the perfect, you know. They should have all had cute little cats, you know. Because, by default, it breaks your if you're a negative person, you just can't help it, you know. She melts your heart. So [right here] (ph) in the middle of one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">their conspiracy theories, you know, suddenly Cecelia just, like, lays down in front of them and, just, you know, they just lose it, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">(Silence)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 18:47) so, so long, so much of your life, by sex as a kind of, like, a central driving force about what motivated you, what would get you out of bed, you know. Women as a way of feeling probably powerful feeling, potent (ph) feeling. Getting away from the emptiness. I think it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">just a way there are other ways of feeling alive and feeling better in your own skin. Or starting to grow, you know, so that that doesn't have to be the only way, you know.

It's still kind of sore or whatever, so I can wear my retainer but it hurts, you know what I mean. And, you know, I have to change it whatever. I have to do something else about that (ph). But I just don't care, you know what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">mean. I'm going to do something, you know what I mean, because I invested a lot in it and, you know, it's just a personal thing. But I don't care that right now it's not, you know what I mean?

I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200972\">it's just a personal thing, but it's not like an overriding like, if I don't wear it at the show. I'm not going to sing more meekly or something like that. I just don't give a fuck. So that's a big deal. That's a really big deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">Or like yesterday, Uma was so hot but, you know. In a way, what do you do? Someone's visiting (ph). I mean, you know, I wanted to take her out, and what are you going to do? It's hot, it's hot, you know. But we were in the back bay, whatever. We went into some place. She wanted to use the bathroom, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">and she found the photo booth thing. You know those photo booths? She's like, \"Oh,\" and she just grabbed me and went in there. And, like, it was fun. Like, I didn't feel weird. I didn't feel like, \"Oh, wait. Like, my hair let me -\" I don't know. (Laughter) I don't feel attractive. And then when I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200992\">saw the pictures, I was like, \"Yeah, that's cool.\" Like, I you know what I mean?

That's very different than, like, you know, veering on sexuality, you know. And there's something where you're describing you with what's her name? I can't remember her name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: Who?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Uma.

Like, one of my favorite things to do with Cecelia is sometimes she'll not sometimes. Every time. So she'll be, like, at the foot of the bed and I need to, like, eat her up. I can't take it anymore, you know. (Laughter) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">So I can literally go up to her and, like, do this and put my head on her, like a pillow. And like, you know, do this and, like, kiss her. And she just I mean, I time it, you know what I mean.

And I think in some ways, it's the same. Like, I think for my mom, whatever, I think it's reawakening or it's getting in touch with the part of them, my mom especially, that's (pause) sweet. That's more genuine and more not concerned with whatever, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">know. It's just more about just love and connection, you know. Which I had a feeling that was going to happen, because I know my mom has that. I mean, I see it in her, you know. It's just I think she's been they've all been beaten down by their own backgrounds and their circumstances, you know. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB2\">some of, like, just their own not genes, but whatever. Just their dad, you know what I mean? Like, that's just their context.

But I took pictures of the ones that I might buy. \"Psychological, Developmental, Social and Methodological (ph)\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD1\">you know what I mean \"Aspects of Cultural Transmission.\" Do you know that book?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 24:32)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">CLIENT: Ute Sch npflug, University Press. It looked really fucking interesting. And I almost bought it, but I was like, I mean, you know. Right now, I'm not, you know. It's a little more academic, although I thought it was (inaudible 24:46). But, like, I was thinking that would be something I'd be really <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">that's me, right. I mean, that's something that I think is really important. Cultural transmission trauma, you know, all these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Is it a textbook, like, for a class? Or is it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: No, it's one of those, you know, like, almost you know those University -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Oh yeah, yeah yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: like, type books. Kind of academic, but easy enough to read that, you know. I'm sure it's probably used in courses, but it's not so dry and heavy. But it's academic.

It's \"Cultural History of Psychotherapy,\" which is really interesting. Anyway. But yeah, but I didn't buy those, because I was like, \"All right, I'm not,\" you know. I got a Jung reader. And (pause) what's that book? \"Denial of Death,\" right? I don't know. There were just a few -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 26:13)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And the other ones seemed I mean, I don't know. They both seemed like books I've heard of or people I've heard of that are probably pretty easy to digest and read. Not overwhelming. And then the Jung I think that's guy interesting. I think he's debunked or whatever, but seems pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D91\">interesting, you know. Then I watched a great documentary about Freud and about whatever he was a bullshit artist or not. (Laughter) That was really interesting. It was a PBS on YouTube.

Are you kidding? It's fantastic. I love it. (Pause) I mean, it's a great feeling to not be mired in daily minutia of anxiety, you know what I mean? It's, like, so liberating.

I'm like I don't give a fuck. I'm just interested in the guy. I just want to, you know. In my spare time, I'm just going to pick it up and just see what it's, you know.

Yeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201451\">it just feels good to like, you know. Or that director whose son has ADHD, you know. There's a book I took a picture of about ADHD. I'm like, well, I'm not going to read it right now but, you know. \"Out of the Fog,\" Kevin Murphy.

Or, like, that you're showing weakness if you're a little too, you know. Whereas I get the exact opposite feeling from this kind of thing. It just seems like people are very in general I don't know. Nothing's perfect, clearly, and I'm sure there's all kinds of <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B1\">things in (ph) psychology too. But there seems to be something where people are some more openness and communication and networking in a nice way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible 37:01) feeling grounded and connected to a community and a subject where you actually get to now really take your passion for something and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">CLIENT: Exactly. I mean, take an example, right. Let's say I went professional into literary studies, right. Well, what does that mean? That means instead of doing this kind of thing. What. I'm going to go to the conference and present a paper on, \"Well, why was there no modernism in our -\" Who the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F1\">fuck gives a shit? I'm interested in that. But do I feel like presenting it to a bunch of dumb asses? No. but I would have to, you know what I mean? I'd have to do some conferences. I really don't care enough. I just don't. I care personally, but I don't care enough to publish it somewhere with all <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F2\">the right footnotes. Just do not give a shit, you know. And I kind of don't give a shit in psychology either, you know. The master's is just to it's purely vocational, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">THERAPIST: As opposed to writing a paper and published it on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.

I'm curious about those things, but I don't want to have some academic discussion about it. (Clears throat) Unless I do it my way, like that lecture I gave. Well, that was mine. That was my night. I did it my way. And it <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201572\">wasn't academic. I mean, it was learned, I hope, but it wasn't academic, you know. And I think that's why I did so well, you know.
