00:02:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I am at a loss as to what to talk about again although I think in a better way this week. In general, I feel better this week than I have for the last couple of weeks. That is a good thing. (Pause) The causes are not immediately obvious but I think some of it is feeling like I have been telling <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">people that I'm upset and trying to deal with that in a, I guess, direct fashion. I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(Pause): [00:03:24 00:03:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not sure where to begin so I it's a strange thing come and not know what I'm asking to consult with you on. But that's where I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Well, I don't think of it as session to session but I think of it as what you've framed what you're asking for consultation on. This is part of the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Okay, well thanks. That's helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(Pause): [00:04:04 [00:04:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes I'm not sure what thread is important to pick up this week, I guess. My parents are coming to visit this weekend. It's probably a good thing. We have a very small apartment so I'm concerned about hosting my parents in our tiny apartment. It's they have a house that's large <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">enough for seven people to live in are used to living in that space and it's a different thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: And they've come to visit before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: My parents haven't visited me since I was in college in Texas. So it's an interesting and different thing. I was in Ohio for four years and after a couple of years my mother decided that she might want to visit instead of just me coming back to visit which in a lot of ways made more sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">me visiting home because the rest of my family is there. It's one person far away and six people relatively close. The direction of travel makes sense for me to be going back home, but that's what my mother decided she wanted to know what I was doing and was curious where I was and all of that. Now, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">here in Andover that's not really going to happen because I was doing all the actual work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(Pause): [00:05:56 00:06:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Now I'm sitting here sort of thinking about how good a question that was that you asked. It seems to get to a lot of the issue I think. They haven't visited before and so to a large extent I have no idea what to expect. I think we've discussed that generates some anxiety for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(Pause): [00:06:53 00:07:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Is the anxiety that there are particular scenarios you're worried about or just is it just sort of really amorphous?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I think it's generalized. It's no particular thing that I am worried about other than there's no particular thing I'm worried about. Just a general feeling of unease about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">(Pause): [00:07:43 00:08:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I think I feel sort of a sense of hosting responsibilities, hosting them that comes with certain, sort of make sure everyone has a good time sort of goals or requirements or something. I'm not particularly clear how to do that in this context. Not that my parents are hard to please. That's <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200351\">the silly part of it. It's like they're ridiculously easygoing, for the most part and if they're bothered, they're not going to tell me, so it will be okay (laughs).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559590\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(Pause): [00:08:46 00:08:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: And they're coming explicitly to see us and to like help take care of us in this difficult time. So it's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">(Pause): [00:08:59 00:10:08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: So I think that's going to be okay. (Pause) Over the weekend and I guess into Monday, Tanya seemed to be getting a little more sad and sleeping more and kind of strange and I found out Monday that she had run out of her Synthroid or synthetic thyroid hormone and I think had stopped taking it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">Friday or before so (Pause) while I really don't think that that is like a primary driver of her depression and just all of the turmoil of the last couple of years, she did have a goiter in part of her thyroid removed and has been doing thyroid suppression therapy since about the time we got married. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">So it fits right into the same time window as everything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">(Pause): [00:11:16 00:11:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">ESPONDENT: One of the major symptoms of hyperthyroidism is increased anxiety and one of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism is tiredness and depression. For awhile I don't remember if I told you this, but for awhile she hadn't had the thyroid nodes checked in months and finally did get them checked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">and she had hyperthyroid numbers, which is the result of essentially taking too much of the thyroid medicine. She got that adjusted and has been less anxious in the intervening time period but this is sort of a I can pick out a signal. It's not clear if there is any meaning to the signal like there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">are so many things going on in our lives that that's not necessarily, it's not even clear there's a correlation. If there were it would not be sufficient evidence for any more causative role but it seems to me like when one has a mood and metabolism regulating gland, keeping the dosage of replacement <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200413\">hormone for that gland stable is probably a good idea when one already has difficulties regulating mood. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(Pause): [00:13:09 00:13:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: This is one of the things where we've talked some about my difficulty with what is she responsible for and what is she not? This is a thing that I feel like she is very much responsible for and that is it like perfectly under control. You go to the doctor. You get the things checked. You take <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">the medication they tell you to take. Maybe think about it a little bit and assess whether you're doing reasonable things with your treatment in that regard. And make sure that piece stays stable. That's it. And that's the thing that she's done fantastically poorly at. And is continuing to do poorly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">at in some sense like I don't know whether she does not understand that after three days she has only 70% or less of the thyroid hormone in her system, or what. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Did you ask her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: No. Because she already feels guilty about not having gotten the medication and so like I intend to ask her but the problem with exponential decay is like impulse treatment it's easy to drop off very quickly. So after a week she would have half or less of the hormone in her system, but it takes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">a long time to build back up. And so if this is actually a contributing factor, talking about it, particularly when I'm kind of angry about the fact that she has failed to do this simple thing again, because we've talked about getting her thyroid medication before. We talked about how I went and got <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">her thyroid medication, like three months ago because she didn't have any.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559590\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">(Pause): [00:15:13 00:15:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: It did not seem like a good idea at the time. So it seemed like not an important issue to confront in the specific moment because she was already going to get it that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So that was Monday. So you didn't find out that she wasn't taking it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Until she I found out she wasn't getting any. So it wasn't I did not need to do anything to get her to get it. It just was a 'why on earth have you not been doing this?' And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">(Pause): [00:15:48 00:15:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I understand how one fails to do errands like sometimes you get busy, sometimes you don't feel like doing whatever particular errand I get that, but this is not an errand of the same magnitude as getting butter or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: That is, if you really need butter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Bad policy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Fair enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">(Pause): [00:16:26 00:16:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: There's also a sense in which I don't like (Pause), yes, this is the thing she's failed to do several times. She doesn't remember all the other times she's failed to do it at least not in the last several months. So, like me being upset about this, as a part of a trend is not a useful or perhaps, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">not even a fair thing. It's certainly not a thing that I think is worth bringing to the discussion to have in an emotional sense. Maybe in a factual sense it is important to know that this is a recurring problem and maybe we need a different solution than wait until you have run out and get it a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200612\">days later, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: There are a couple of questions that I have. One is what are you worried about in sort of saying in the moment when you're feeling upset about something like this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">(Pause): [00:17:40 00:17:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I mean we've talked since when Tanya was here that she has a hard time handling me being upset and so like I am concerned that me being angry is going to impact her negatively in a dangerous way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Is the dangerous part the important part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. It sort of makes it easier to justify like behaving in this fashion. I'm not sure that that's actually the I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Well, I think this is the heart of the matter in your marriage, is how free are you how free are you? Maybe that's the end of the sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">(Pause): [00:18:34 00:18:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And how much are you as you described very pointedly, held hostage? (Pause) You'd certainly feel more free than you did maybe two months ago, but clearly not fully free because you don't feel you can express yourself when you feel angry because you're very worried about the implications <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">in a very dire way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: And I'm not always as worried about the implications in a dire way as I was this time not that she was doing particularly poorly, but like this is back into it. If my guess is about the thyroid issues is correct then she is in a more unstable place in this specific moment and so it's like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">so, yes, the concerns are more dire then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">(Pause): [00:19:31 00:20:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I guess I feel like you made a statement and I mostly agree with the statement and so I'm not sure what to say in response. Yeah, I think that's an accurate assessment. (Pause) It does not feel particularly free to say that I found this upsetting, not that I can completely hide from her when <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">I find something upsetting but -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559590\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">(Pause): [00:20:30 00:21:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: So are you saying 'nowhere to go' it's like you don't have any train of thoughts or you don't know what to do about it or -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">(Pause): [00:21:24 00:21:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know what to do about it. Yeah, I mean, I don't know what to do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">(Pause): [00:22:00 00:22:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like you're pointing to this thing and I'm saying, \"yes, that seems like about the right thing.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Now what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Um hmm [yes].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: You know, we can spend time talking about that more, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">(Pause): [00:22:26 00:22:37]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: I'm not sure what further description of the problem will do if we both already grasp what the problem is. Or, maybe the point is, I don't fully grasp what the problem is, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: I think that's the part I'm not sure that you specifically don't fully grasp, maybe we don't know all of what's at stake. (Pause) I mean, you're not one to do something because you're feeling that it's going to set your already fragile way around suicide alley, over the edge. That construction, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">yeah. Okay. Well, that's logical. That makes sense. But then there are also assumptions in that that sort of needs to be thought about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, and in this specific case, it wasn't so much like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">(Pause): [00:23:31 00:23:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: It wasn't so much that I thought she was suicidal in the moment and that anything I said might push her over the edge, but it certainly has that subjects related to my behavior in those time periods. It's more than -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">(Pause): [00:23:58 00:24:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: So part of it is that since she's already made the or is about to make the call to get the prescription refilled, there is no practical value in asking, 'why did you do this?' Because she's already fixed it in some sense or as much as it is possible to fix it at that point. And so there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">no immediacy to the discussion even to happen and at that time she already feels guilty and bad about not having done it and I feel angry and that's not a useful kind of combination of emotions for us to have a conversation. And so if I were to wait for a little while before bringing it up again, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B2\">can be less angry and she can be less guilty and maybe we can actually have a conversation in which the like factual piece that she has to do this in a more timely fashion can be discussed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">(Pause): [00:25:46 00:25:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I was thinking there are a couple of pieces in that. One is that it's helpful to know why I'm not just commenting on the timeline of when you bring it up, but she may actually not think it impacts her mood the way you feel it might and so that's a useful conversation to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: It's also a conversation she really doesn't like having. She really doesn't like it when I suggest that this I have watched this thing impact her mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Do you know why she doesn't' like it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">(Pause): [00:26:24 00:26:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: That's a good question. I think it's just a piece where she feels like if someone else can notice it, she should have noticed it. I think there's a piece where she has had plenty of people tell her, 'oh, you should try this to cure your depression.' You know like, 'when I had a headache, I took <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">some aspirin. If you have a migraine, you should take some aspirin, also.' And that sort of analogy and it doesn't she has a particular ire about that class of discussion. And I think any suggestion of 'this is a thing that is contributing to your mood,' taps into that emotion.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559590\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It is this pedantic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: I think so.

You're being pedantic, taking that you are I'm not (unclear) you are in response to something, in this behavior, she's doing this actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">eliciting that response so it's an interaction. You're not just acting in a vacuum. That's an interesting kind of conversation to have. I mean there's a lot of interesting you're saying, these are the reasons not to have a conversation and I'm saying those are actually interesting departures for a conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">(Pause): [00:28:06 00:28:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that was I was intending to give reasons not to have that conversation in the moment when I'm angry, and she has like in that moment.

They are conversations that we haven't been able to have the way we would have two or three years ago in more recent days. Not days like in the last several months, but that's because there has been a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">sense in which the Tanya I would have those conversations with, hasn't existed in the last several months.

The issue at hand is you've felt for so long that you've had to bracket your needs for the sake of Tanya and in a sense felt a conflict that your needs, if they don't, maybe not to say, undermine her needs, at least undermine <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">your ability to be present for her. So there's a conflict on that level. This is maybe more direct that maybe your need to be expressive at the moment actually undermines what you think her need is to stay alive her need is to stay alive. Whether it undermines it or not is the question. It goes to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D92\">the heart of I mean you may not think that it's much to give up by waiting a day or so. It may not. That may not be a big issue for you, but it sort of gets to the heart of how much do you need to bracket your needs or hold yourself back, constrain yourself or confine yourself for the sake of Tanya.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559590\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">(Pause): [00:34:49 00:36:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: What were you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: I hate thinking, I can't you say that's right. What do I talk about in response to that? And I think the important thing is that I think that is impacting the way I interact with people more generally, particularly friends. I think that in a sense, habit of bracketing my needs, is in order <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">to maintain it, I have done it more than just in my relationship with Tanya. And it's hard to notice at first, in some sense, because I usually try to be a considerate person, taking into account the needs of other people. So this, in a sense, plays directly into a worldview that I already have and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E12\">so it's, I think it's hard to notice or has been hard to notice that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">(Pause): [00:37:14 00:37:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: And it's a fine line, it's on a continuum, they're not discrete categories being considerate of others' needs, sometimes means bracketing your needs a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Then, sort of extrapolate out, you know, in (unclear) and being especially considerate of being desperate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: You know, there's no there's not distinct categories that's a continuum which makes it more complicated. It's like on one level you're not wanting to express yourself in the heat of the moment for fear of hurting Tanya, it all sounds reasonable enough, but there is more complexity to it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED1\">than that. Does that always have to be the case?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: And if it does have to be the case right now, for how long does it have to be the case?

That's a pretty good mechanistic answer for how we got there. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: And you're speaking to Tanya as you might kind of might tell a demented grandmother 'did you take your medication today?'

And so I try not to do that, to avoid that structure but end up in this place and then I'm angry and we're back into like it just is complicated in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559590\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">(Pause): [00:39:50 00:39:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: But you broadened it. What you started to think about as the extent to which you do that and this is in a very particular context in your marriage and also in terms of what's gone on for Tanya.

I always find that something of a difficult question because I feel like my needs need to be balanced against some <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D1\">sense of group needs which I think comes from having four siblings and having a strong recognition that we all have desires like from an early age. But usually I find the problem, like where's the balance or something like that. Here I've found unable to identify a particular desire sometimes is also <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D2\">the case. Like sometimes I just don't care. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">(Pause): [00:41:24 00:41:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: But in this context it seemed or seems, or something, like I have suppressed the desires to the extent that I can't find them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">(Pause): [00:41:51 00:41:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Where do you think they went?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: (Laughing) I don't know.

Really, I have a hard time figuring out what I want. But I do have some desires still, like there is this sense in which I really don't want to live in a city larger than this. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B1\">I'd rather live in a city smaller than this, but I can be sort of very clear that I don't want that. But it's taking me a little bit of time to like recognize that desire or anti-desire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Denver's a pretty big city. There are that many cities in the country bigger than this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: That's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: In general, if you count the metro-Denver area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: So that's actually not that hard. I'm sure there are a more concentration of jobs in those larger cities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: There is that problem. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: But still, there are not that many cities that are larger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: No. It's not a problem like the issue is something more like, it took me a while to come to recognize that that is something that I don't want, although it's really obvious that I don't want that. I'm not that happy living in the city, like in a day-to-day sense. It's just really noisy and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B1\">there's nowhere green or quiet. I mean there are trees, so at least there are trees on the streets. It's not like parts of Delaware. But yeah, so I don't know where they went, but I can recognize them as they come back or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">THERAPIST: \"Come back.\" Meaning that they were there but they are buried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think that I ceased to have desires. I think I ceased to know what they were, but I could be wrong about that. Maybe I just stopped having any desires at all. I'm not sure. At some point I don't know that it matters like in a practical sense that I can't find them so they might <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F1\">as well not exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: It seems like a big difference that they're there but they're buried versus if they were never there.

They have some, for me, some essential similarity. They may not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">be as similar as I think they are because other people certainly seem to find them very, very discrete categories. It's interesting. For me it's like here are the values of what we know. Obviously, the next thing to look for is this.
