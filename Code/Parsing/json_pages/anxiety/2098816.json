I was like trying to go to bed and James was downstairs and it was really cold in the room and I was like, [inaudible 0:00:51] why don't they fucking turn the heat up in this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">house and started weeping. And it was like, okay, yeah, yeah, Chad [ph 00:01:04] is right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So. Yeah. I don't think I am still, but I didn't think I was to begin with, so I don't know. (Pause) Yeah. Yeah, I made it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Yep. Absolutely. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I feel like maybe the Geodon [ph 0:01:42] is helping. To inject the Geodon and not the [inaudible 0:01:45] because I don't have the side effects that it was giving me before. [inaudible 0:01:49] but there is some interaction between the two. And it just feels like I can kind of get it and manage <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">things. Managing things there is sometimes that, but, yeah. It's good to be here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well, welcome back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Thanks. I get very scared whenever I don't see you for a week or more. I get scared that things are going to be different. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: In any particular way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: (Pause) I guess I'm mostly afraid you won't be as gentle with me as you usually are that and be upset with me. Or that you will be the kind of person that gets upset with me. But I am also afraid that you will just say you don't want to do that anymore or switch careers or something. Just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">that things will be different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I suppose I'm also scared that now I feel like I'm doing really well and I'm afraid that now you'll be like, \"Actually, I think you feel like this\" and it'll be like, \"Oh, crap, now I feel horrible again.\" So there's that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: [Interposing] think that too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I've been there has been a lot of kind of can I make it to Wednesday. Not so much that it's been especially hard, but, you know, especially the last couple of work days have been hard. I've been doing a lot of distracting things and trying to say I've been distracting myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">a lot. Watching a lot of TV; reading a lot. Drinking some. (Pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">So yeah and I guess \"fear\" is kind of the watchword.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: And really the talk with James about job searches. You know, we agreed that I'm really just going to focus on teaching jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I'm going to you know, look for substitute teaching positions and [inaudible 0:05:14] long term teaching positions, but that that's really the thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:05:24]? Sort of anything you can find?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I feel much more confident about that and much better about doing that job, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: So, you know, we got back and the next morning I woke up and I guess this would be the day before yesterday I woke up and said, \"Okay. I am unemployed now. I have to be doing something to look for a job.\" So I have been kind of keeping busy the last couple of days as also a way to kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">be less anxious. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098816\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: My [inaudible 00:06:09]'s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I [inaudible 00:06:22].

Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess going home a pretty similar thing happened to what's happened when I've been in the hospital, of just being in a completely different environment, being completely away from the things that I've been worried about. You know, we have other things that I have been worried about, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">but feeling like they weren't as bad or I was more equipped to handle them. And (pause) yeah, I guess I just feel like I had another wind had a second wind or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I'm scared, though because realistically speaking, things are probably going to get bad again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: And the likelihood is that there won't be they'll probably get bad again pretty soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Um hm. When did you get back up here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: On the 30th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: The night of the 30th. I saw Mom on the 30th and it was actually a very, very good visit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, she thought so, too, which was nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: She's like, \"This is the [inaudible 00:07:56]. Yeah and, you know, there were a couple of awkward moments, but like when she told me that she kept calling me Marla in her mind. Marla is her younger sister because to me they're kind of we're kind of the same person. (Chuckles) Or fill the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">same role. She's like, \"I guess that I feel very maternal towards Marla.\" I was like, \"Maybe it's because you don't feel very maternal towards me.\" (Chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: But that's okay. She's been going through her grandparents papers. Her grandmother died awhile back, I guess, but she's had all this stuff and she's just going through it. So she's she talked a lot about her parents' lives and her grandparents' lives and a lot of stuff I didn't know. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">I didn't know that my grandfather didn't go to seminary until after he got married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible 00:09:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Agnostic.

She was a student.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: And he decided that that's not what he wanted to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, he played the organ. He had a, like, side job playing the organ at an Episcopal church and he just listened to the sermons, was baptized, then went to Seminary the next year which I am amazed that they let him do that. That's not usual. But he was extremely gifted and, lots of great [interposing].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: He was a pretty great pretty good composer and amazing musician. I think just very, very bright. Not very nice. Very, very bright. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: But yeah, we went to visit some estates; toured the mansion and all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: I feel really good about the way we set it [inaudible 00:11:05] up. So we were very clear about wanting to see Mom without my siblings and then she suggested doing something and that would work really well. Like going and doing something. Like going and taking a visit and looking around. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098816\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Right. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Which was, I think, much better than going back to her apartment. And (pause) yeah. Both she and my mother in law gave us electric kettles. (Laughter) Which uhhh that happens to my mother in law a lot. Like she thinks people think that other people get them the same thing a lot and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">I think it drives her nuts. So I think we're not just not going to tell anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: (Chuckles) Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: You know, if and when I get a job teaching [inaudible 0:12:14].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm really scared. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm really thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Saying, \"Yes, I'm scared\" then decide how to take everything as it comes. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I wonder if part of what you're scared of here is not knowing what you did wrong to get kicked out of here for a week and a half or whatever time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Hm...I wonder if it's more I know when I didn't do anything wrong. I feel like there must have been something. I don't like to think that it seems like things that are so important to me can just stop and there can not be anything that I've done to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Um hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: So maybe I'm scared that I didn't do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: I'm glad you're okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Thanks.

Not really. I figured it was probably the flu. (Pause) [inaudible 00:14:43] seems like you need to be fairly incapacitated to take time off. You do.
