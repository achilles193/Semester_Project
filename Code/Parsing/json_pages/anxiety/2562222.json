I did some busy work this weekend. Not too much is going on. I\u2019ve been feeling a little overworked and not sure [ ].  I kind of wish I had something else for myself, the sort of work that gave me more energy because I feel like everything I\u2019m doing is like I should <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">do that or I should go to work or I shouldn\u2019t. (pause)  Maybe I\u2019m wanting something new or something else in terms of [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:29) what I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m not quite sure. (pause)  Yesterday at work \u2013 data analysis that my boss wanted me to do and I\u2019m just feeling tired, so I thought I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">would feel more rested or fresher tomorrow so I\u2019ll do that tomorrow. I was just worried, though, that I would feel bogged down and tired. (pause)  I guess I kind of wish that I could push through it, but I\u2019m feeling like this week is going to be slow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:05:34) you wish this could be easier that you could feel freer or that you were talking more about things you enjoy? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I guess a little bit, but I don\u2019t know what those things are. I\u2019m always focused on what I need to do next. (long pause)  Most things that I think are [ ] (inaudible at 00:07:50) or take my mind off things are okay for a little bit, but in the end I\u2019m just worn out or feel out of place and don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">really want to be there. It takes a lot of effort. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re not easy and they\u2019re not refreshing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Right. I guess it\u2019s good to have something to look forward to do and [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:12), but usually afterwards I feel like I should be doing a better job with being social or I should just be better at talking or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So you feel like you get more focused on how you did talking to people or what you could have said or what you shouldn\u2019t have said or what makes you quiet or something like that, rather than being able to enjoy what you have planned? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I guess, in a way, specifically more on your performance. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right.  I guess I feel like I don\u2019t have much to talk about or stuff to add to the conversation or talk about. I\u2019m kind of boring. I just feel forced or stretching or trying. I guess it makes me feel like I should do more things or I should be interested in more things. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: You feel like you\u2019re kind of laughing at some part of yourself that would have things to say or opinions or stuff like that \u2013 is that part and parcel of having a good time with people? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s opinions, to some extent interests, spontaneous things to say \u2013 all that kind of stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I just want it to be easier, just more opinions \u2013 more things I\u2019m interested in or enjoy or something that I could talk about.

Yeah.] (ph?) (long pause)  I\u2019m just thinking of why I don\u2019t have any interests or why I don\u2019t. It\u2019s like me just not wanting to care or something. I don\u2019t know what it is. Or not wanting to be disappointed or distracted by it.

(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I imagine it might be frustrating and maybe also sad to not know what you\u2019re invested in or what you enjoy or what your friends enjoy doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I guess also alienating.

(pause) I don\u2019t really know what it is. (long pause)  I\u2019m only focused on the negative. Maybe that\u2019s part of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry \u2013 you\u2019re only focused on . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: The negative or the down side of everything. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I guess you seem focused on what you do wrong that might cause that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. Or like I\u2019m thinking of things I used to do more or things that other people do that they enjoy \u2013why don\u2019t I like those things?  (long pause)  [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:54) not to do, but I should push myself and try. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me you\u2019re delineating a couple of related reasons that it\u2019s difficult to pursue or even know things that you enjoy in their own right for their own sake. And it does seem to me, in parallel with some of the stuff we\u2019ve talked about, to have to do with social stuff and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">spending time with people. I guess the first one is in a way that you\u2019ll be pulled off, out of or distracted from getting work done or the things you need to do \u2013 things that can be really onerous; but also anxious in a way, but it also helps to keep you feel more grounded in a way.  Relatedly, if you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">were to get absorbed with something that you enjoy, I guess with the social stuff, the way it manifests is that you have a disagreement with somebody or have a strong negative reaction to something they said or did; and then can be kind of split in half with part of you seeing it from their point of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200413\">view and some part of you seeing it from your own.  I imagine there is something like that with finding an activity or something that you would enjoy doing and that part of you would feel let down or like it was pointless, I imagine, or didn\u2019t reflect well on you in some way or something along those <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200414\">lines. Then on the other side, it would be nice or you would feel like you had a right to do it or enjoy it or something like that. It seems like those are the sorts of things we\u2019re talking about that make it difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right.  (pause) I guess I don\u2019t know if I just focus on the negative aspect or it\u2019s what I take away from it mainly, but I feel anxious because I am being taken away from work or anxious because I don\u2019t have anything to talk about or that\u2019s all I\u2019m focused on. [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:53)  seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">the positive. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re either focused on the pull-away from work or on how you are not contributing enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t like hearing about what other people do or what they\u2019re up to or if they\u2019re not going to ask me to talk about it \u2013 it\u2019s fine. But when I have to contribute something or I\u2019m put on the spot, I don\u2019t like it so it makes me want to withdraw or not be in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">that situation.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I guess you\u2019re also partly referring, I think, to feeling ashamed about having more to say; like the desire to withdraw is partly from not having something to contribute, but I think also feeling pretty bad about that \u2013 maybe inadequate and ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)  I guess it\u2019s like there\u2019s really nothing to say. When you\u2019re talking about work, which I do all the time, there is not much to say about it. There are a bunch of things to do and I just do it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: I wonder if there is some of this that has to do with a fear you have of what will come out \u2013 that it will put you in danger and that the other person, including me, will be shaming about it or will find it really out of kilter.  I\u2019m aware that somewhere you have that kind of fear, as well. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I think the only fear is that I\u2019m going to come off, when they\u2019re all talking about these things, and it\u2019s apparent that there is not that much there or that there is not much that I really care about or that I\u2019m interested in. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Do you find yourself boring when it comes to this kind of stuff? Do you feel a bit deadened or something?

(pause) I guess I feel like I\u2019m just always so focused on the negative and I just kind of come off as worried and I don\u2019t want to talk about how everything is awful.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you get sick and tired of it. (pause)  I guess those are the things that are on your mind, even though you feel like that\u2019s all wrong and that you should be thinking also some more positive things or that maybe you have more of an interested in that what is actually on your mind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">more of the time is more negative and critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right. I should care about more things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: This makes me feel about it a little bit differently, as though you feel like there isn\u2019t enough room maybe because of feeling so negative or so bad.
