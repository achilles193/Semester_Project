I called them earlier today and they hadn't finished entering the faxes, so they couldn't tell me if they had gotten the faxes back yesterday. So, I just got a fax from them saying, \"We need you to re-fax, because the information is incomplete.\" I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">know if that's because it came as two separate faxes (and they didn't realize they had both of them); I think that's what it is, because it said, \"Please also send us an out-of-network form,\" which I did.

It's a form that's... It's a one-page form that asks for some demographic information about me and you, a diagnosis code, some symptoms (like, if a person has some symptoms), and then there is the bit about... like, list three problems and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">are things improving, staying the same, or getting worse. That's about it. It's not very substantial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Do you think the three problems that you listed are improving, staying the same, or getting worse? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: I honestly do not even remember what they are.

Yeah, I mean... I do try to think about, obviously, what's going on and how things are going, but I... That's quite separate from, um, the kind that Blue Cross and Blue Shield request for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: And your (inaudible)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Um, yeah. They leave you about... like, that much space to write the problem, and it has to be like, behaviorally specific. It can't be, you know, \"Patient...\" Like, things like, \"Patient frequently experiences low (inaudible),\" or (client affirms) you know, \"Has difficulty in x kind of relationship,\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">[pause 00:04:47 to 00:05:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: How are your allergies?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: A little better, thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559853\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Do you think this the bad time for allergies?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah, mine usually suck for like, nonstop (ph) this time of year.

I have periods of calm that usually come about after like, some kind of meditative thing. I haven't been able to sit for like, four days, but... (therapist responds) I've been doing, I haven't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">been able to like, sit on my own for (inaudible). We've been doing guided meditations that are like, focusing and not so much my mindful (therapist responds), because I think there is like, so much... like, meta-mindfulness going on in the waves of anxiety that aren't useful and aren't particularly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200532\">insightful, but they're there. I can't take like, dissecting them right now, or (therapist responds) (inaudible), you know like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">So that has been nice, because it gives me a sense of like, confidence that I can achieve a different mental state, with a lot of work, at will. (pause) Um... I don't know what triggered it. I think... there is a lot going on that is very, very full (ph). I am... I could be a scientist, if I wanted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I'll bet you could. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Well, in doing the type of work that I'm doing... it's just like, all on the cutting edge. There is no precedent, probably no useful precedent for most of what I'm doing, and it's very cool (coughs), and (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: That's all very cool. That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it's a, the relationship with my work that I have never experienced before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Oh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Which was like, this is the kind of work, do I really want to be doing this much work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Is the new part that last question or...? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: No, I think it's different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: ...the whole shebang?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: I think it's like... and the nature of the work is so... exploratory and failure-ridden and open-ended and personal... right now, at least. That's the nature of the work. Yeah, but I just, there is like, some like, line that I've crossed. I think it's like, the more than... a certain amount <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">of each day is spent on work (therapist affirms) while (inaudible) (blocked) and I feel like... I don't know; I'm not sure how I feel about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">I'm pretty happy with the work, I mean, with like, doing it and what I'm doing as I'm entering and how I'm being stimulated. It just feels like a very slippery slope. (pause) I think it feels like I've crossed a line, because I'm already, I'm all of a sudden like... imagining myself as a professor. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">I've never done that before (therapist affirms), and that like... involves a type of stress that... I don't know if I want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">(pause) So there is that, and then the sick, I'm getting sick, I think. And... um, this is pretty stressful. I've been on this like, obsessive financial aid kick for a couple of days.

I wonder if... you're working on pushing some other boundaries? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Like with you? I think with Jeremy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: I guess I was thinking with work and with the financial aid and stuff that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Oh. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: And that... for some reason, you're... sort of directing energy at pushing those boundaries. I don't know if... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Well, I guess I meant, I don't know why I'm working so hard at like... on Dr. Burton (ph), like the financial aid or some billing. (pause) Like, I really want Jeremy to see me as... like, having some kind of financial awareness, be an activist, awareness of the financial end of this, but... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">I don't know. It's like a really similar thing to like, just diverting energy that has to do with missing you to like, something. I... getting really worked up about financial aid is like more useful to deal with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (pause) What have you been thinking about? Me or missing me or things between you and me since May?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Well, I'm wondering if like, if you've thought about all the things you said you'd think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: (pause) Um...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: (pause) That wasn't an answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think... um... that was the question. I mean... Because I remember that you... said... you thought I was... overlooking... or... focused away from... ways we're compatible, how things are between us... and I said, I think that's the main thing I said I would think about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. I guess that feels like a lot of things. I think there is something else, but it doesn't... I don't remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: (pause) And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">[pause 00:18:16 to 00:18:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">I did think about it.

I just sort of don't have much to say about it. And I thought... how would anything I thought about it, would the question actually affect... how things, yeah, how, why it was here and I... couldn't think of much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, I haven't much to say about it either, you know, I (inaudible) think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: I don't know what to say about it here. And then the third thing I wondered about is... what do you sense of what I've overlooked. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Well, I just think you're taller than my kite (ph) (therapist affirms), so that's really hard. (pause) (therapist affirms) Um, I keep struggling to... identify like, what of that has come up since... either of us like, open their mouths... and just developed this relationship, and what of that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">is always true. (pause) I mean, you're... and that also, it's hard to know like, what you, who you are anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">(pause) So... I don't know what, how much of what do you feel (ph). I mean, you're sort of like, you're a quiet-ish... sensitive, man with a spiritual and artistic Jeremyt, s type (ph), not only in... the realm of like, romantic love, but in the realm of... deep companionship and friendship. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">And sometimes it feels like I would rather have that than anything we were doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">(pause) But, there is the deep companionship here that is... and that, I can't, and I don't ignore that.

(pause) I mean the thought that keeps occurring to me is like, that, you know, that's the bitch about therapy. Um... and... when... in the kind of like... compatibility that you mention, like creates intensity, opportunity, and a lot of suffering. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559853\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: (pause) So maybe we're incompatible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Hmm.

I wouldn't have thought it was getting in the way of our working on things. I think... (pause) I mean, I do think I have a sense of... helping put it and... I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">[pause 00:30:04 to 00:30:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">Does what you're... I have thought that some of what you're... struggling and suffering with... actually feels pretty central to what... we're working on, or you're working on, or talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">[pause 00:31:05 to 00:32:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: What do you think about... having a therapy friend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: (pause) I didn't hear. Did you say you think about it, or did you ask what I think about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: What do you think about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: (pause) Somebody you can talk to about what's going on in therapy?

I'm not saying you shouldn't. I just... I just don't really hear about it, haven't really heard about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Maybe you could be my therapy friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I could be? Yeah, that's how it usually... works. But maybe I misunderstand like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Well... it's not enough. (pause) I need to talk about it more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: You need more time here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: I mean, I don't need anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: What would help? Would it help if you had more time here? I think it might.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: I feel like I have to talk more (inaudible) to be here with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: (pause) Am I not being as helpful as I could be with talking about it? Like, sort of with the therapy friendship part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: You are being helpful. (pause) I can think more about... (weak\/inaudible) (pause) I had a pretty... excellent dream that I would like to share now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible) the copier. (adjusts microphone) I don't want to be distracted while you're... telling me about the... okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Can you see that? (therapist affirms) (pause) You're so psyched!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I am? Do you care about dream? (pause) Well, I'm happy you had the dream, that's true. But I'm happy to hear about the dream because... mostly because... it feels to me like you're going to start talking about what you actually want to start talking about, what you actually want to be talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">about. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559853\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: I think a lot of things... that I've been thinking about like... will come up. (therapist affirms) The dream happened Tuesday night. (pause) The other dream about you happened Saturday night. I think there was like, some sense of relief that... tomorrow is the day before Jay. That, it could <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">be, that could be completely unrelated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">In the dream, you and your wife... are having... a therapy... like, a retreat, workshop, Dharma talk, party thing at some like, retreat center. And... Let's just call her \"M.\" You and \"M\" are like, so... devoted to this like, event. It doesn't feel like an event, I mean it doesn't feel like... something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">that you have to be \"on\" for, which was like really noticeable. It's like this whole big thing, like you go to this place, there are all these people like, you are there. It's from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. and I don't feel like, I don't feel \"on\" and like I have to be \"on\" like, the entire time, so that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E32\">great. That's pretty cool. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">Your patients are there and her patients are there. She wasn't necessarily a good counselor or therapist in the dream, but somehow like, she's really tuned in to this world and... She's like, part of you or something. There are aspects of the dream that seem like they're modeled after this couple, Carter <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E51\">Rogers (ph) and Charlotte Moore (ph). Carter was Jeremy's, one of Jeremy's PIs when he worked in Los Angeles. He works at UCLA Medical School (inaudible). (pause) I don't know, cognitive, neuropsychologist or something, something like that. Maybe there is some like, the word clinical in there too. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E52\">is a clinical psychologist and I don't know like, why they come up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Her name is Charlotte Moore? (client affirms) Okay. I don't know her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: She is a research, she does research. I don't know why, it didn't come up in the dream, but like, somehow they were like, some like, parts of them are being involved in the dream. Carter is like, totally the most charming, nice, kind self-deprecating guy we know. He, Jeremy is like, totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">loves him. They really love each other. And that doesn't happen that often with Jeremy, in a work environment. Carter is very special, and they just had a baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">So... I felt like, so much camaraderie with your patients, not like, any jealousy (which is like, what I'd normally feel in real life). It was this like, beautiful... environment of just like, studying and celebrating and like, probing what we do here. I don't know what we did all day, but it really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">I mean, it felt like a... felt like a Dharma talk. Do you get what I mean when I say that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I mean, I've been to Dharma talks, but I don't... I don't know what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: I don't know. It felt like you were... you and \"M,\" even though \"M\" didn't really speak, and we, but it was mostly you and maybe there were invited people, invited speakers, but we were all just sort of like, sitting around... meditation style, although people were quite loose and just themselves <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">and like, exploring like what it is, this is and... why we do it, why it exists, why it works, why it doesn't work. And it wasn't clinical or academic, it was like a soul... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559853\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I see. That was probably how it was like a Dharma talk? (client affirms) It wasn't professionalized? (client denies) Or medicalized...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: No. It was like real... we're all here because we...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: We're into this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: It's more like we live, we are alive and like, we are drawn to this thing or like, we have to, we just can't... We're here and we don't know why or like, we're trying to figure out why. So you were completely \"on,\" which means that you were just like, tirelessly like, running around like, making <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">sure that everybody felt good. Like, I paid a lot of attention to your feet or your shoes, but you were wearing like really strange shoes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: What did they look like? Or what do you remember they looked like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: You know those like, xylophone toys, with the like, different colored keys? (therapist affirms) You had like, you were like, wearing one of those, but like a small one. It was like a loafer. You had like, fun socks on. I think, because I look at your feet a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">So, um... So one thing that comes up is that I've been entertaining the possibility that to you... the potential outside of these boundaries and the potential inside of these boundaries... Like, one isn't like, way better than the other for you. (therapist responds) And actually like, the dream was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">a lot about how special the potential is inside the boundary and like, clearly how much your life... is made up of that (therapist responds), and how special we all are to you, and how much you've learned from us (therapist affirms), and how like, it transcends like, the family line. It just (weak\/inaudible). <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD2\">(pause) And your wife was like, completely in tune with us and what it was all about. (therapist affirms) (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: As opposed to feeling like, in conflict or (client affirms) possessive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Or in, or like, indifferent or resentful (therapist responds). Yeah, I guess those things are in conflict. (therapist affirms) (pause) Or like, just sort of like a little bit detached, like she was completely in it. (therapist affirms) She knew everything. (pause) And she cared a lot. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">I'm not sure that I've cared so much about... about myself as a patient actually, but (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">So, she was like, pouring some drinks... there was like some, one interaction between me and her where it was very warm, but she was like, pouring bourbon and saying like, \"Well, we use this bourbon for cooking.\" And I was like, \"You should never use that bourbon for cooking! Only use it for drinking! <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">And drink it like, very slowly and in small amounts and really savor it.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">(pause) She was like, \"Okay. Thanks.\" And then like, I interacted with her a lot like, just like sensing her aura. So, at some point... Oh, so like, we, you and I were supposed to have a public session at the end of this thing... (pause) which like, didn't happen, thank goodness. (both chuckle) I don't, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201051\">I think I was the only one. Maybe the whole thing was full of people having public sessions. I can't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Maybe not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: I can't remember what we did all day. But like, mine was at the end. I think I had this fantasy of like, you taking me to the (ph) center and like, us talking about this with other analysts. (pause) I think there is a lot there. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20108-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20108-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559853\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">Late at night in the dream, you... I think like, the whole day was full of like, you talking about your patients as like... objects of study and like, you know, love and I was like, fueling this sort of Dharma talk part of it. So you started to talk, but it wasn't like anything that made the patients <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">feel bad or good or, it was just like, we were all trying to like, appreciate and learn. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">We start talking about this one patient who is... this like, totally... He's like, kind of older guy, very like, strong and... he had like a beard, and wearing like a hat and he has like, this old torn tee shirt on, a little overweight, and like a wind-burned person who works with his hands or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D1\">You started talking about how... he... this patient, you named him by name, and he was like, sitting right there, like some introduction, blah blah blah, and how sometimes he masturbates and forms, and these were your words, rings of ejaculate on his shirt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">You like, start talking a lot about these rings like, the rings of a tree trunk. And there is something in there about strawberry... (pause) Yeah, it was like, quite involved. I don't remember anything else about it, except those words. And my reaction, after taking all of this in... Oh, and you said <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">(chuckles), you know like, people were... people were paying attention. You sort of made this joke about how like, \"Oh like, you can imagine how my coffee would get cold during the session.\" (therapist responds) Sort of an interesting, because you don't drink coffee. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">(pause) Do you drink coffee elsewhere? Yeah, I didn't think so. (pause) My reaction to this guy and you talking about him wasn't like... all men, but that was kind of out there, it was kind of like, (therapist responds) gross or... anything like that, it was like, \"Whoa! That guy is like, totally himself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">and has... (pause) Like, he's just like... getting himself to the sessions and he's not...\" yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">(pause) So I guess like, he is like, putting himself out there, but not, um, performing. That was like, my one thought about... about that. (pause) And then there was like,15 minutes left and like, our session ends up not happening, I'm pretty relieved, and then we all like, take a bus home. And I come <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201131\">home and Jeremy is still awake and... Like, I feel like I have like, opened a new chapter or something, or being transformed by this day. Jeremy is so psyched, because one of his good friends like, wants him to... design his like, wardrobe or something. He starts talking about it and then, I woke up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Wardrobe, as in like, a piece of wooden furniture, or is it clothing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Like, tee shirts. (therapist affirms) Then the last thing I remember is Jeremy tells me, \"Oh, I'm going to have him wear like, musicaland athletic-themed original art like, on his shirts.\" (pause) Then I awoke and I wrote it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: (pause) And you felt okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Sorry! It's not surprising that I forgot that, because... (pause) Well, because when I woke up, I felt super, I felt like, so energized that I had this dream and like, I felt really energized to like, think about it and to write it down and tell you about it. I felt so sad because I like, wasn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">going to see you again like, to tell you about it.

I missed the new chapter thing makes more sense now.

It was like a very del ... I'm just telling you this, because I think it informs a lot of the rings of ejaculate type. This was a bath about like, self like, okay. I have some like, glowing, very loving compassionate <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201291\">like, thing in me and I really like, want it to sooth me. Like, I don't, I don't know like, why it's not coming out and it's sort of like a desperation. So this bath was like, I had like, this in mind. (pause) But it's not as... forced as it sounds. It was just like, \"Hey, let's like, find that part.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: I think it's (inaudible) took a bath, could be relaxing, soothing, and also you were hoping it would give some space for this part to come out? (client affirms) Because... you needed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I really needed it. So, I masturbated in the bath and it was like this long journey of like, stopping and starting, stopping and starting. I'm like playing with lots and lots of types of like, mental and emotional fodder. (therapist affirms) Mostly I like, don't usually like, need to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">about anything (therapist affirms)... but on Tuesday I thought a lot about like, women's bodies sort of floating and like, rubbing against each other (therapist responds) and being totally like, aroused by each other. (therapist responds) And like, and sort of cooing and making aroused noises and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D2\">like, sometimes it was like, lots of women, sometimes it was like less of them and some men. The women didn't really have (inaudible), they just had beautiful bodies. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">(pause) This was like an hour of like... yeah, just sort of like, digging a little bit and then like, mentally and then like... just touching myself without thinking anything, didn't really think, stopping and starting. At some point, I... sort of like invited you into the bath, because one of the things <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">that I find more useful in fantasizing about like, what I do here is fantasizing about what I would say or do if you were like, with me (therapist responds), where I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">(pause) So, I had like about a minute of... you giving me head (therapist affirms) and you're like, forehead line and your ears and your hair and like, the shape of your head and your neck were like, so vivid in my like, hands on either side of your head. (pause) And... It was really arousing. (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201311\">affirms) It didn't last very long. I couldn't like, handle it for that long. And it also felt like the girls were more in self... soothing or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: (inaudible), I don't understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: Like, I could self soothe more with the girls (therapist affirms), getting aroused by the girls than you or like, any other men. (pause) It also, at some point during this like vitalize (ph) a painting. And I'm... whatever I feel, I like to paint and what I look like and how it would be a practice <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201351\">that I would... that would feel like if like, if everybody had a lot to say in painting.
