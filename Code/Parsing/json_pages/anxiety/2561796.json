Hi Jessa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Hi Debbie. How are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Well, thank you. It\u2019s good to see you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: You too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Before we begin full force in terms of my hearing about your homework and other things, I would like to share a few things with you for you to contemplate, which could be useful and helpful. The reason I suggested that you have pen and paper, is that you just might want to jot them down to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">help you remember them if you feel that it will be beneficial for you to do so. [00:01:18.21] So I would like to point out a few of the main things I\u2019ve noticed over the course of the last seven sessions that we\u2019ve had, in order to help you increase your awareness both of your progress and also of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">areas that could require more focus and attention given your goal of wanting to lessen, and at best, largely lessen, and to a large extent eradicate the degree of anxiety that you\u2019ve tended to experience too easily over the years. That was one of the main goals we started with, that you shared you wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">to work on changing: anxiety. [00:02:10.02] So first of all, I want to acknowledge your progress, in that every time we speak I notice your telling me that your thinking about your thinking is more often happening, and that includes a few times that we have briefly talked when we\u2019ve happened to cross <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">paths since we live quite close to one another. It has been strangely and curiously interesting how we\u2019ve just sort of bumped into each other between sessions...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Several times, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Several times. So we\u2019ve had a few brief chats, in addition to our sessions. One of the things that has been very apparent to me has been your increased awareness of your thinking. And that\u2019s the huge first step that preludes change. And it can be easy to minimize or neglect the acknowledgement <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">of progress. It\u2019s easy to minimize the importance of acknowledging such progress, especially if one doesn\u2019t see as much progress as one would want. But truly, that awareness, that self-awareness, is a first important step on the path towards greater well-being. So I really want to highlight how well <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">you\u2019ve been doing in that regard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Also, I want to remind you that in the first session and early sessions, especially in the earlier sessions, you almost cowered if I would give some positive comment to you about you. And as time has gone on you seem to be more comfortable in just saying thank you, which indicates to me the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">possibility of some greater acceptance within yourself. Now I haven\u2019t had any indications that you\u2019re totally established in unconditional self-acceptance 24 hours a day, and frankly I haven\u2019t met too many people who are, but I\u2019ve seen undeniable improvement in that regard in you. [00:04:18.18] If there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">is anything I say that you think is way off track you\u2019ll tell me I hope, but I\u2019m glad you give me the opportunity share these points with you now and then I\u2019d love to hear what you think. So they\u2019re two of the main things that stand out. Some other things I\u2019ve noticed that you have tended to do at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">times, which are not helpful for you, and greater awareness of them can aid you to do them less and again Jessa, disagree with me if you think I\u2019m off track, please. One thought I have, and an observation, is that there appears to be some unreasonable levels of expectation in your mind about how well <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">you should do in a short time, and that is something that could well be keeping you back. [00:05:25.01] I\u2019m hypothesizing that if you believe that you should be very much improved, or this much improved, or totally improved within x-number of weeks, months, years, and then if you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">anywhere near that level of improvementespecially if you believe you are at the contrary level of improvement which is that you\u2019re not anywhere near the state you think you should be at, then that can contribute to a tendency to allow yourself to give up somewhat, and to think it\u2019s hopeless or you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">hopeless. Examples of that were seen in times that you\u2019ve experienced anxiety just a few weeks ago and you related to me that you didn\u2019t really get into the disputing because you didn\u2019t feel you understood it well enough nor that you could do it well enough. [00:06:20.28] And you said that you felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D7\">anxious about the disputing. And so I just want to ask you to ask yourself the question, is this true that you may have a tendency, if not all of the time then some of the time or more of the time, to give up too quickly, to hold back, to not focus on making effort going forward because you\u2019re already, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D8\">and I\u2019ll add wrongly, assuming it\u2019s too much, too hard, hopeless, that you can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s too unfamiliar, and that it shouldn\u2019t feel so unfamiliar by now? And you tell yourself \u2013 \u201cbecause it\u2019s so unfamiliar I don\u2019t know if I can do it\u201d? Those sorts of thoughts can contribute to your holding yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D9\">back from making effort and doing the homework, whether it is poorly, badly or the like, instead of just making some effort or more effort. [00:07:19.29] You have made effort in some areas of our work which has been excellent by the way, I am not saying that you haven\u2019t. I didn\u2019t earlier acknowledge <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D10\">my respect for the way that you are applying yourself during a very challenging time in your life with your physical pain in your shoulder and your neck. Despite and including that you carry on with your life. You go to work, you do what you can in the gym, you\u2019re seeking more helpful medical treatments, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D11\">and you\u2019ve done some work on the issues we explore. But my focus with you and my goal in our work is to help you as best as I can to help you help yourself as best as you can. And I think at times you hold yourself back, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of your sore shoulder. I think it may be the tendency <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D12\">to assume that if you are not doing well enough, soon enough, or if it\u2019s too hard \u2013 you may think \u201cI just can\u2019t do it\u201d. [00:08:09.19] For example times you haven\u2019t done disputing, and hence you have stayed stewing in panic and anxiety. And you do yourself in unnecessarily. So I point this out to encourage <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D13\">you to think about it because with awareness and motivation, the efforts you make to effect the changes you seek may be increased and improved. By the way, let me say, it\u2019s not unusual for people to do what I have just described that you have done. So if you\u2019re going to jump into thinking how inferior <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D14\">you are after hearing what I shared here, stop that immediately! Cease and desist!<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">CLIENT: Actually, I always that thought okay, anyway, sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">THERAPIST: That thought what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">CLIENT: No, I it wasn\u2019t right at the forefront, like it tends to be, but I was just thinking I was agreeing with what you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">THERAPIST: Okay, so I\u2019ll continue. I don\u2019t have that much more to share on this... It\u2019s been quite a monologue here so far !<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">CLIENT: Too bad you don\u2019t have much more because it\u2019s fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well, there\u2019s more. If this is fun then my...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m joking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Oh, you are? Well joking is good, if you\u2019re really joking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m really joking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: So at some time we\u2019ll look into your ability to be joking about the people who you used to take so very seriously and found challenging in your life! [00:09:12.00] That\u2019s one of the goals too, isn\u2019t it. All right. To continue in what I\u2019ve said in the last few minutes, I touched on this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">point but in slightly different language, so I\u2019ll say it in the following form... What I have noticed at times is a tendency for you to assess yourself too harshly; seeking perfection, reprimanding yourself strictly according to how you think you should be. And that will hurt you. That will hurt you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">That will limit you and increase the probability, if you continue to think in that way, of creating and maintaining anxiety and panic and the other states of being that are a waste of this precious life and which you want to reduce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: I agree. I agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Okay. So then in the carrying on of this theme, a few days ago you emailed me about anxiety, which was fine. [00:10:29.04] And in my email back to you I gave you a little reminder, which I\u2019m going to do here. I think your comment was something like, I\u2019m having anxiety, and I reminded you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">you\u2019re not \u2018having\u2019 it, you\u2019re allowing it, you\u2019re creating it and allowing it to remain there by not disputing your thoughts. So it was fine that you emailed me but what might have been finer with a goal of self-empowerment might have been for you to notice your anxiety and do your ABCs and do your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200352\">vigorous disputing to tackle it. And what you allowed yourself to do, and please hear that this isn\u2019t a criticism of you or an assessment that you\u2019re just not doing good enough... [00:11:18.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: No, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an observation in order to help you be more aware of any tendency towards arrested development in this context, meaning when you gasp with [sharp intake of breath] anxiety or panic, and staying there instead of saying, well, look at this anxiety and panic, what am I telling myself. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">to go forward from there. You see? So just a reminder here. Okay. Nearly finished here and then I want to hear what you have to say. And then I\u2019d like to explore the two homework assignments, actually, that you had, the one from last week and the one that we talked about when we bumped into each other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">a few days ago. One more of the things that I\u2019ve observed about you at times, and not always, for example right now I\u2019m not observing it, but at times your mind is racing. You\u2019re a very, very outstandingly intelligent and bright woman. [00:12:23.19] You do have a lot going on in your life, and the ability <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200393\">to think, and to think about many things in your life, helps you. But when it\u2019s out of control like a group of wild horses in a confined space, kept there to keep them safe (and you\u2019re tearing up here and in a moment I\u2019d really like to hear what\u2019s going on ). Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I mention it so you can be aware of it. So with awareness you can make the effort to slow down at times and focus more. [00:13:26.03] And it is an effort, particularly if you\u2019re in the habit of letting the mind run unchecked. I know it can be an effort, but it\u2019s worth it. And the more you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">make the effort the easier it becomes to still the mind. You\u2019ve shared with me that you do something that sounds to be highly beneficial for a number of reasons that you spend time each day meditating, praying, and doing other contemplative work, and that\u2019s a sort of quiet calm and reflective time <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">for you. So you seem to have the ability, when you choose to use it, to take time out to think differently. To use your mind differently.[00:14:12.11] And again, as I said a few moments ago, I think it\u2019s a very life enhancing practice, and I encourage you to keep doing that for the rest of your life <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D3\">as it seems to serve you very well, and many people who do such practices say they really can serve them very well. But in terms of the other 23 hours of the day, if you don\u2019t harness your ability to focus your mind on particular things, then that one hour of meditation or that contemplative practice <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D4\">is not serving you as well as it could, or shall I say it\u2019s not branching out into your other hours to enhance this precious life you\u2019ve got. So there\u2019s an image, let me describe it as an image I have of you having that hour of quiet contemplation, your energies balanced and you feel a calm from within, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D5\">and then you get to the dramas of daily life: the mundane and the tedious and the challenging and the difficult. And you have a choice during those hours, especially during the challenging moments, to stop and think \u201cwhat am I telling myself? [00:15:32.24] How can I get back to the steadiness I experienced <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D6\">this morning?\u201d Or you can let the wild horses of the mind run free in a way that\u2019s not helpful. So I point that out. Sometimes when we\u2019re together in a session you talk very quickly and many things come up. And if that speedy way of talking is representative of the way you think I can well understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D7\">how challenging it might be for you to keep the mind focused at times. Having said that, as one who also can have a really busy mind until I rein in the wild horses of my mind, I understand. But I also know it\u2019s do-able to train the mind. The final point I\u2019d like to mention before handing over to you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D8\">for your comments and then our looking at the homework and other things, is the thought that, ironically, you may greatly benefit from using your ability to focus more on the moment versus thinking about what will be and what has been. Being more in the moment in the sense of stability and steadiness <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D9\">by being less involved in the dramas of the moment. That sounds ironic, doesn\u2019t it? But do you know what I mean? So for example, you mentioned to me when I saw you a few days ago that you just had a jolly old time with your family, ho, ho, ho. And you had succumbed to that habitual tendency to take <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D10\">them too seriously and be affected emotionally and in an unhealthy way for you. [00:17:36.04] And so if you practice the ability you\u2019ve got to reign in thoughts and use focus, if you use it to be in such a provocative situation and detach yourself and watch it as you would as an observer of an unfolding <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D11\">comedy or drama rather than taking a role and being totally absorbed in the daughter role of these never-to-be-pleased parents and funny brother and all the rest that goes on. By extracting yourself in a sense and observing it, you can be more, in a sense, in the present moment, and enjoy the experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D12\">of equilibrium, which is a nice antidote to the emotional visceral experience of anxiety. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Everything that you say makes sense. It doesn\u2019t not make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">THERAPIST: So the challenge is, at times when you\u2019re noticing too much mental speediness, to slow yourself down through will and intention to be watchful, to choose your thoughts and be willing to keep at it without expecting perfection, or even huge advances, by any pre-set date. Just know already <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200411\">there has been profound progress, Jessa. And it will serve you well to keep on making effort in that journey because the easy tendency to anxiety and panic is still there. Not surprisingly. It\u2019s only been weeks. And on we go. So you\u2019re teary now. Tell me what\u2019s going on and your responses. You shake <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200412\">your head, but the best way to use our time together is to share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">CLIENT: I know. I just don\u2019t what to I don\u2019t really know what to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">THERAPIST: Just begin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what to say though. I don\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">THERAPIST: When you say you don\u2019t know what to say, do you have some idea of what you should say? There\u2019s no should. [00:19:55.16] Tell me your thoughts about what I\u2019ve said and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">CLIENT: No, because it\u2019s not about I mean it is about what you said because it\u2019s all related to that, but it\u2019s just I was having these feelings today that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the right candidate for something like REBT because not because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s amazing and that you might be able to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">help me with whatever it is that I need help with, but I just I feel like it\u2019s like every time that I really try to do it, to have the to do the disputing, I really feel like there\u2019s just it\u2019s almost like phobia or something. Or I don\u2019t know what it even is. And I just had a really, really challenging <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B2\">day, starting with the morning when I fell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Wait, wait, wait. I want to hear about your challenging day\u2026 But let\u2019s stick with what you\u2019ve just said. And this is an example, hopefully, of me being a voice in your mind when you\u2019re thinking about lots of things, of saying hang on, let me finish with that first thought before I go onto <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">the next one. [00:21:08.26]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">CLIENT: Okay, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">THERAPIST: Okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re talking about the phobia when it comes to doing the disputing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, and just even anxiety. When I said I\u2019m having anxiety, to me it feels that way because instead of thinking no, the anxiety\u2019s having me, there are times where I get these feelings in the pit of my stomach, which is what I had when I did send you a message, and I feel like I can\u2019t get out <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">of it. I feel like I\u2019m...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">THERAPIST: You think. It\u2019s not a feeling, it is a thought you think \u201cI can\u2019t get out of it\u201d. Feelings don\u2019t talk. Feelings don\u2019t tell you what you can\u2019t do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s where I think I\u2019m really confused. I just think I\u2019m confused between feelings and thoughts. I don\u2019t understand the difference between like I know that you have a thought and then you get a feeling, but then I also think that I don\u2019t really know how to break it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Try not to overcomplicate it, Jessa. Thoughts and feelings they\u2019re interconnected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: There\u2019s just so many thoughts. I think there\u2019s so many thoughts that I have and they don\u2019t stop. [00:22:08.08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">THERAPIST: Well, then bit by bit, you can keep on making effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: No, so I just feel like the way that I talk is that way. You\u2019re right. It is really fast because my brain just doesn\u2019t I feel like it doesn\u2019t work right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: It works the way it works and you have the ability to, step by step, change the way it works. And right now it seems to me you\u2019re saying, \u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve tried for a short while. And maybe lightly. Lightly not meaning trivially, but meaning allowing yourself to give up easily, and not stick with stringent application of REBT homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: Well I have an example. No, but I have an example of what happened today, where I felt where I was really, really just I wasn\u2019t doing paper, it wasn\u2019t writing anything down, but it was a situation that occurred that I thought okay, how can I apply this, and I just I really felt like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B1\">couldn\u2019t apply it with what happened today. [00:23:07.10] And I\u2019m sure that I probably could but technically I couldn\u2019t. You understand what I\u2019m saying? Based on the philosophies I could apply it, but you\u2019re sitting here with me now so maybe you\u2019ll go through it with me, but it\u2019s almost like when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B2\">you have a tutor for a class and then you go to take the test and then and you can\u2019t do the test as well as...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Because you assume that you \u201cshould\u201d be able to do it more easily by now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: Well I would like to be able to by now because it would really have helped me today in the situation that I was in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: If you only \u201cliked\u2019\u2019 to be able to do it, you wouldn\u2019t be catastrophizing as you are right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t know. I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: That indicates that you think you should\u2019ve. And already you\u2019re damning yourself and giving yourself the label I\u2019m not a candidate for REBT because you haven\u2019t made what you consider enough progress by now. This is what you\u2019re doing. Unnecessarily you are harder on yourself, I think, than <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200751\">you are on any other human in the universe. [00:24:03.25] I don\u2019t think you would ever treat one of your children who you counsel, the school kids, the way you treat yourself. So I\u2019m pointing this out to you, and it\u2019s very good that you don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s not bad that you\u2019re feeling this sadness and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200752\">these tears are coming because it gives us an opportunity to look at it. So would you do you want to tell me now what happened after which you convinced yourself \u201cI can\u2019t apply it. I just can\u2019t do it\u201d. Tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Well there was the weekend, which we don\u2019t have to rehash, but I already emailed you that so that was kind of I was already kind of just feeling I mean I can just say it for...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">THERAPIST: Just say what happened on the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">CLIENT: Basically that I went to go see my family and yes, I really it would be really ideal to be able to just be a passive observer but I feel like I\u2019m always being I\u2019m damned if I do and damned if I don\u2019t in my family. [00:25:02.25] In my particular family that\u2019s what I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">THERAPIST: These are two separate things now. Now I\u2019ve never suggested being a observer means not taking action: I suggested that in your mind on the inside observe. That\u2019s one thing. So and the other thing to look at is your belief that you\u2019re damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. Your parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D1\">may damn you if you do or don\u2019t. But YOU can refuse to do that to yourself, if you so choose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">CLIENT: They yeah, they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying you can change them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t. And I know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: Okay, but you\u2019re doing to yourself what you say they\u2019re doing to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: And that you can change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Okay. I don\u2019t know how to change it. I don\u2019t know how to change it and then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You stop and you think. If it helps you to think of a school child who you feel tenderness for, sitting in the chair that you\u2019re sitting in, and your parents doing it to that child. My hunch is wouldn\u2019t you defend the child or say to the child: \u201cDon\u2019t take them seriously; don\u2019t listen to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">them\u201d. So that\u2019s what it takes. [00:26:05.27] You\u2019re nodding now, so that tells me that you would do it for another child, and your difficulty until now is doing it for yourself. This is the new thing I\u2019m encouraging you to start doing. And you\u2019re giving up before you get more, more, more into it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D2\">you\u2019ve told yourself \u201cI\u2019m not a candidate\u201d. I don\u2019t agree. If you convince yourself you\u2019re not a candidate, then you won\u2019t make the effort and you won\u2019t be. But you\u2019ve got what it takes to be one if you won\u2019t give up on yourself, just as you wouldn\u2019t give up on a child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: I know. I just hate it how defeated I felt after the weekend. That\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: Okay. So stop. If you agree with my words \u2013 think that I\u2019m being the voice that you can be for yourself. You just said \u201cI hate how defeated I feel after the weekend\u201d. If one of your little vulnerable students didn\u2019t do their homework and they were crying the way you are now, feeling so bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200911\">that they didn\u2019t do it, would you give up on them? [00:27:08.06] Would you say, \u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to do it\u201d? Or would you have compassion and say, \u201cKeep going sweetheart\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: No, I would be compassionate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yes. I have been pointing out to you now that you\u2019re not being compassionate to yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: Well, because there\u2019s more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yes, I\u2019m not running out the door now. I\u2019m just stopping you from talking about a new issue, bit by bit, so we focus on one thing at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: No, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Because you said to me earlier \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop the thoughts\u201d.

I understand what you\u2019re doing. I do.

And normally I don\u2019t think it would have been that big of a deal, but I have a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF1\">herniated disc and I just had shoulder surgery so I just it just made I just felt really weak because I couldn\u2019t even get up on my own after, and I needed help.

I didn\u2019t like that feeling that I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Because what were you probably telling yourself ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: That I should be able to get up on my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yes. So tell me now why on earth you should be able to get up \u2013 after you\u2019ve had physical bodily trauma you\u2019ve been dealing with for all these months when you slip on oil?

I feel like I\u2019ve been doing all the right things and I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You think you have been doing all the right things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it and I feel like, or I think I don\u2019t even know. [00:32:03.00] This is why I don\u2019t like this kind of stuff because I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m thinking, if I\u2019m feeling, if I\u2019m feeling, if I\u2019m thinking. I don\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: If there are words involved, you\u2019re thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah? And feeling, you know what the feeling is. It is a visceral experience. You have been making good effort, and this...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">CLIENT: You\u2019re talking about with the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200ED\">THERAPIST: You are bravely doing what you can, and not knowing what to do about a neurosurgeon. And your distress is very understandable. It\u2019s a very uncomfortable situation. You want your health. You want to not suffer anymore. You want to feel the way you did two years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EF\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019ve had this and that to deal with, and then this morning you fell. It\u2019s little wonder that it\u2019s been a really tough day for you and you feel the way you feel. [00:33:01.05] But what is not helping you, and what possibly is making it worse, is you\u2019re thinking in a way that adds hopelessness <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F11\">to what in reality is difficult. Difficult, but NOT hopeless. I\u2019m not going to tell you oh Jessa, you\u2019re taking this too seriously. It is serious and it\u2019s difficult I truly empathize with you and I wish I could just go boom and take the pain away and all. And unfortunately when it comes to these physical <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F12\">conditions, all we can do is to try our best to find the best help and healing for ourselves, which you have been doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: I just don\u2019t but I don\u2019t know what that is. And so that\u2019s where I feel like I don\u2019t understand the REBT and how that plays into it when I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Two different things here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: Right, but I feel very stuck. So I was trying to help myself to get out of it and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was doing research and just I feel like and then I went to my doctor, who\u2019s been doing the needling treatment, and then he throws in, oh, it\u2019s not a neurosurgeon that would be doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200F71\">it, it\u2019s an orthopedic surgeon. [00:34:14.04] And I\u2019m like I said, you\u2019re confusing me even more. Because now I don\u2019t even know what surgeon. So I\u2019m...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Regarding surgery \u2013 you don\u2019t know what the best thing to do is right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: Right, so I don\u2019t know, do surgery, not do surgery, orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, do the surgery. And then everybody in the peanut gallery has their comments to me. You know how that goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200FA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yes, and we talked about your friend some weeks ago, the guy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: Who gave his opinion, and his whole attitude of catastrophizing. And we were talking then about the helpfulness and importance of your being discerning about who you listen to. [00:35:02.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: Well my friend did that on the I mean I guess I was able to apply the REBT techniques because my friend who\u2019s been really helpful, who gave me the recommendation for the neurosurgeon, when I told him that my doctor said it\u2019s an orthopedic surgeon he said, he should be sued. He should be sued <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">for saying that. And I think that\u2019s a little extreme. And I think that this is a different friend. That\u2019s a different friend. So everybody and their but yet he\u2019s so helpful. So I was just like whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s helpful? When you talk quickly it can be hard for me to follow\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20107\">CLIENT: This other guy, the one that said this is a different friend from the friend [inaudible] and he said, he should your doctor should be sued for saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20109\">THERAPIST: Well again, he could be right and he could be wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010D\">THERAPIST: The fact of the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2010F\">CLIENT: And then it comes back to I guess I\u2019m not smart enough, which I know is, I\u2019m sure, something that I could work out, figure out, but I feel like I always go back to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">THERAPIST: Right. So let\u2019s pause now. Steady. In some ways you\u2019re not smart enough. How is that? What do I mean? You are not a surgeon.You don\u2019t have the ability to operate on your own knee. So there\u2019s some agreement there. [00:36:06.02] You\u2019re not smart enough to do that, okay? Good, you\u2019re laughing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve thought about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019m glad that your conclusion was to leave the surgical scissors in the drawer! Or you could decide to operate on yourself, have your two cats as the nurses. Ask them to pass you the gauze, cotton balls. (laughter). You do have the ability Jessa to, number one, fight hopelessness. Remind <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201151\">yourself that being in a physical body, unfortunately parts of it can tend to break down. For many conditions there\u2019s no absolute certainty, there\u2019s no clear prognosis for many people with certain conditions. And we\u2019ve touched in the past on your having a desire or, let\u2019s say, need at times for certainty, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201152\">which doesn\u2019t exist, certainly does not exist, and that issue seems to be rearing its head here. [00:37:09.11] So the reality is you\u2019re in a tough situation. You\u2019re getting different opinions. There may not be any way of knowing which thing is the surely best thing to do, until possibly after you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201153\">done something. Logically it seems that what might be helpful now is to assess whether there is some improvement as a result what you\u2019re doing now. Is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s where and I\u2019ve thought about that but that\u2019s even hard to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s too soon because you\u2019re still in an early stage of this course of treatment. But if you still have some quality of life, if you are not in agonizing pain all the time, if you still are having moments of enjoyment, if your current doctor who\u2019s giving you the treatment says, \u201chang <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201191\">in there, keep going until February and then let\u2019s assess\u201d then perhaps today, the second of December, 2013, you don\u2019t need to decide on \u201cdo I get a neurosurgeon, a back surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, or a veterinarian to operate on me now\u201d. [00:38:24.16] Perhaps you can, not necessarily from friends, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201192\">Jessa, [ph] but utilizing some patience, do some research. I don\u2019t necessarily mean on your own and Googling, I mean research into whether there another doctor. I\u2019m not suggesting look for a 100 doctors, because then it could be quick path to utter confusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20118-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20118-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011B\">CLIENT: I know.

It\u2019s very...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011F\">CLIENT: This has been nine months. It\u2019s been nine months. I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m just really tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20121\">THERAPIST: Understandably. Understandably. [00:39:04.00] But think about where you have a choice. You can give up, or you can think: \u201cI am so tired. Is there anything I can do\u201d, meaning you \u2013 Jessa .. I\u2019m speaking as your voice now \u2026 \u201cto just make it a little easier on myself for the next three days, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201211\">three weeks, two months, pamper myself, take it easy. Not need to know the right thing to do because there actually is no absolute way of know what it is I don\u2019t think is a way of knowing the absolute right thing to do there isn\u2019t\u201d. So focusing on the here and now, on right now, tonight, and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201212\">week, think: \u201cI needn\u2019t find a new doctor or surgeon right now, or make a decision about having surgery or not\u201d. Take it easy; keep gently exploring and doing what you\u2019re doing. How does that sound?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20123\">CLIENT: I kind of did that already. I had already had those thoughts in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20125\">THERAPIST: Did that help?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20127\">CLIENT: A little bit. [00:40:06.12] I feel like it helps but I still feel depressed, so I don\u2019t know how to change that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20129\">THERAPIST: Okay, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">CLIENT: Like those were the thoughts that I had and yet I still feel depressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Okay, so let\u2019s observe this gently and compassionately as you would with a child. Okay? So those thoughts took away tell me if I\u2019m wrong some of the urgency and anxiety about \u2013 \u201coh, what should I do, which operation, which surgeon?\u201d. Right? That\u2019s what you just told me, isn\u2019t it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F\">CLIENT: A little bit. Yeah, I felt better \u2013 a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20131\">THERAPIST: A little is better than not at all. And \u201ca little better\u201d it\u2019s better than feeling worse. So instead of feeling more panicked...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20133\">CLIENT: The way I kind of thought in my head was: \u201cJessa, you had surgery on your shoulder, you were lying on his table screaming, crying in pain, before he said, well let\u2019s operate\u201d. I said to myself, so maybe l\u2019ll have to wait for that if before you make any decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20135\">THERAPIST: Or not. It may not have to be that extreme. [00:41:00.19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20137\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s what I that\u2019s what I kind of feel at this point because I don\u2019t know what to do, so that\u2019s kind of how I concluded in my mind is that you don\u2019t just I don\u2019t even know if I should go see a neurosurgeon, do I not see one. All that kind of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20139\">THERAPIST: Well at some point...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B\">CLIENT: Because a neurosurgeon\u2019s an operator. They\u2019re going to operate. So they\u2019re not just going to sit there and say, let\u2019s take a look at this and let\u2019s talk about alternative methods. So that\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m at. That I don\u2019t know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Some surgeons may. I would hope that a responsible neurosurgeon would say, listen, I don\u2019t think this is necessary right now. So that could be a wrong assumption on your part. That the surgeon will just want to operate.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2013C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2013F\">CLIENT: Or everybody else that I listen to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20141\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s where...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20143\">CLIENT: They all say A surgeon wants to operate; a surgeon wants to operate. If one more person says, a surgeon wants to operate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20145\">THERAPIST: Yes, and I\u2019ve heard of doctors who say to patients \u201cSurgery isn\u2019t best for you now\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20147\">CLIENT: So have I. I know, that\u2019s not what I said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20149\">THERAPIST: Yes, so it is good that you\u2019ve noticed that you got sucked into the opinions of others yet again. [00:42:03.06] Thinking Oh, a surgeon will do this. Some corrupt ones might. But I do believe that there are also surgeons who are highly ethical, and they are required to tell you any risks, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201491\">and they don\u2019t want to damage you most and hopefully ALL surgeons don\u2019t want to damage clients. If a few psychopaths got into medicine maybe they might I\u2019m kidding but wrong assumption there, that all surgeons will see you and think \u201coh, goody, goody, another patient to operate on... Get out <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201492\">the gloves!\u201d Okay, so it\u2019s a wrong assumption. What you\u2019ve told me is that you felt a little less panicked when you thought the things you thought about the prospect of surgery, but then you told me \u201cbut I still felt depressed\u201d. Now, is it possible that there are other thoughts contributing to the depression? <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201493\">[00:43:08.27] You\u2019re nodding yes so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014B\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t know what they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Well this is the point at which...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014F\">CLIENT: Is it possible to have thoughts and not I guess the way the brain works you could probably have many, many thoughts on one point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20151\">THERAPIST: Oh I think you\u2019re good at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">CLIENT: So but a lot of times I don\u2019t really give it I don\u2019t sit and observe them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20155\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. And this is one of the things from early on this evening and now I\u2019m encouraging you to do. And I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20157\">CLIENT: They\u2019re more frenetic I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20159\">THERAPIST: You allow yourself yes, to let the horses run wild. And one of the things that I\u2019m attempting to do tonight is to partly model an attitude you can have in your own head to help you monitor and choose your own thinking. [00:44:04.08] I have probably interrupted you more tonight than in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201591\">past, not because I\u2019m not listening to you, because I\u2019m listening to you as carefully as I always do, but because I want to demonstrate for you, model for you, what you can do in your own head if you\u2019re willing to, if you\u2019re willing to be watchful enough because you know that will help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015D\">THERAPIST: And yes, you are a candidate for receiving benefit of REBT if you\u2019re willing to not give up on yourself. And that\u2019s been some of what I was hearing from you earlier tonight. But you also look brighter and more hopeful now so I\u2019m not saying you look totally bright and totally hopeful, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015D1\">shook your head, but some change is there already, yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s just nice to talk and be able to dissect a little bit in terms of some of the thoughts. [00:45:11.08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20161\">THERAPIST: You were about to say something, but me being that \u201cvoice in your head mode\u201d I\u2019m stopping you to go back to what we hadn\u2019t finished, which was you feeling depressed despite the fact that you were able to make yourself less overwhelmed and panicked about your thought \u201c should I see a surgeon <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201611\">or not\u201d. Okay. So just because there\u2019s progress in that area, you\u2019re pointing out to me something that countless people experience until they pull themselves up by the bootstrings, whatever that means.

Well clearly so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20167\">CLIENT: Or not know what they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20169\">THERAPIST: I think you mean that they don\u2019t know what they are clearly and automatically, and that\u2019s when it\u2019s helpful to stop and ask yourself, even if you don\u2019t have a definite knowledge of the exact thought you are thinking: \u201cWhat might I be telling myself?\u201d. A helpful question is \u201cwell, what might <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201691\">I be thinking?\u201d. \u201cWhat could I be thinking that would contribute to this? What\u2019s my hunch\u201d? Again, not looking for the right answer, for the definitive reason you\u2019re creating your depression, or the definitive statement, thought, you have in your head, but what might it be. So what might it be? Or they <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201692\">if there are a few thoughts. It\u2019s probably not an it, it could be a they. So let\u2019s hear some of the probable theys that are creating or contributing to your depression right now, Jessa, that you describe. [00:47:04.01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016B\">CLIENT: I just have a lot of fiery thoughts that are firing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Well, fire away. Let\u2019s hear them. But not too quickly. One at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016F\">CLIENT: Okay, that I can\u2019t make the right decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20171\">THERAPIST: As I should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20173\">CLIENT: As I should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20175\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t forget the \u2018as I should\u2019. Because the reality is that at times you may not be able to make the right decision, but that doesn\u2019t lead to depression. Because as humans \u2013 we are fallible. By the way, could you decide which chemical will end cancer? I mean how could you possibly know that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201751\">since you\u2019re not a biochemist and it\u2019s not your field. So sometimes we can\u2019t know. That doesn\u2019t cause depression \u2013 the not knowing; it\u2019s the adding of \u201cas I should\u201d. So do you think you\u2019re probably adding that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20177\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20179\">THERAPIST: Okay, so there\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017B\">CLIENT: I am adding that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017D\">THERAPIST: All right. Good revelation. Helpful. That\u2019s what is contributing to or creating depression, probably. What else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2017F\">CLIENT: There\u2019s so many. Sometimes I feel like I have a thought and then I don\u2019t want to say it. [00:48:09.06] You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20181\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20183\">CLIENT: Because then it makes it a reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20185\">THERAPIST: Oh. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20187\">CLIENT: Like if I actually put it out there then I feel like it becomes more realistic. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to describe that but just it\u2019s like or I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to say a thought and that you\u2019re going to think that it sounds insane, as it shouldn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20189\">THERAPIST: Oh really !!!, and I need to think only good things about you, and you shouldn\u2019t reveal any of your flaws or vulnerability ! (joking) Well, if I was a potential judge in your life I might be that way why would you have a potential judge in your life? It is interesting to observe that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201891\">still might think that you are needing my approval on some level. When are you going to drop that? [00:49:03.06]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P13-N20188-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"12\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20188-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2018B\">CLIENT: Yeah, well that\u2019s kind of what I feel like is ruling the roost, is my constant need for approval. And I\u2019m very much aware of it but having a hard time stopping that. And I don\u2019t and I know where it comes from and I know where it I know where it comes from. There\u2019s no question about it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2018B1\">it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve looked for and sought for many, many years from my family, and I know that I\u2019m not I\u2019m very aware that I\u2019m not going to get that from them, so I think that there\u2019s a disappointment in knowing that, but then I also wonder, I guess, where the other depression is maybe stemming <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2018B2\">from is wondering why, the why of why this happened the way that it did in terms of that I don\u2019t that I can\u2019t be like everybody else and independent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Why would you want to be like everybody else?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2018F\">CLIENT: Independent, like others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20191\">THERAPIST: Oh, everyone else is independent? I see. [00:50:04.12] So the rest of the human race is totally healthy, independent, and together, and you\u2019re the only one...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20193\">CLIENT: Well I just think I have anger that I wasn\u2019t raised with tools to create independency, to be independent. And I know that. And that\u2019s it\u2019s unfortunate that that happened, but now it\u2019s almost like I feel like I\u2019m re-raising myself. I feel that on a lot of days. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20195\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s called adulthood. Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20197\">CLIENT: Oh, when you re-raise yourself. Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20199\">THERAPIST: Yes, when you\u2019re teaching yourself healthy ways of living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2019B\">CLIENT: See, but I didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t know that. I thought...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Now you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2019F\">CLIENT: Oh, so every adult goes or adults go through that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A1\">THERAPIST: No, every adult who feels depressed does not, because a lot of people don\u2019t work at changing their thinking, and they either live in denial or repression or taking medication instead of doing what you\u2019re willing to attempt to do which is to rethink and retrain your thinking so that you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201A11\">not feeling as depressed and hopeless and anxious and panicked. [00:51:11.11] It\u2019s a human condition to easily create unhealthy thinking and therefore suffer the emotional consequences. And you\u2019re doing what is what most humans don\u2019t bother to do either because they don\u2019t know they have the choice, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201A12\">or they just are too lazy, or they wrongly convince themselves it\u2019s too hard, or better the devil I know than the devil I don\u2019t. So you\u2019re stepping out. And you have been doing so for a while, and you\u2019ve already noticed positive changes. Even before we started working together you were gaining greater <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201A13\">self-awareness through your former type of therapy and all. So, you\u2019re creating distress, including that of anger unnecessarily by telling yourself that it shouldn\u2019t have been this way and you shouldn\u2019t have to be doing what you\u2019re doing. [00:52:17.20] Is that correct?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A3\">CLIENT: Yes, I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Okay, well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A7\">CLIENT: Because I feel like I look at others, I compare myself to others, and say that they I think of a person who is not struggling with the issues that I have and that they that when you\u2019re not constantly being corrected or whatever it is, then you\u2019re allowed to fail and make mistakes and be <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201A71\">raised in a way that I know it might not be logical to think like that but there is, at times, where I feel angry that I wasn\u2019t that I was always picked up from my mistakes by my parents and their way of we\u2019ll take care of it and we\u2019ll fix it and we\u2019ll fix it, and it\u2019s so I feel that it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N201A72\">ingrained to a point where now I\u2019m trying or attempting to sort of break free, but I feel like it\u2019s actually a lot more challenging than I even thought that it was to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N201A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N201A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":14,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"14\" data-page=\"14\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201A9\">THERAPIST: So it is. So it is. [00:53:16.10] It\u2019s more challenging, but is it impossibly challenging?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201AB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know because I haven\u2019t done it. I mean it hasn\u2019t happened I haven\u2019t succeeded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201AD\">THERAPIST: When I first started talking with you tonight I mentioned to you some of the progress that I have observed that you\u2019ve made. You\u2019re right now forgetting that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201AF\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Forgetting, not what I said earlier, forgetting your progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201B3\">CLIENT: Well it\u2019s hard, too, because I even had a teacher came to me and said, I and said, this is important and I think just to show how it\u2019s worked for me to accept, that one of the kids, a kindergarten student, told another kindergarten student who\u2019s afraid of heights, he said, I know somebody <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N201B31\">you should go and see for that. Another five year old says and she said, who. And he said, her name is Jessa and she helps kids with feelings, and she helped me and I think you should see her about your problem. And a teacher heard it and then brought it back to me that this was what the kid was saying <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N201B32\">in the hall. And I what I have a hard time, I think, handling is that instead of focusing on that, I think I jumped to what I\u2019m not doing, what I can\u2019t what I\u2019m not doing enough of. And it\u2019s that race to sort of that, for me, I feel should have been enough. So then there we go again. See, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N201B33\">is where I that I felt in my head Jessa, you should be content with that statement today. That that should\u2019ve turned your day around, and it\u2019s the shoulds and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Well It would\u2019ve been really healthy and a good gift to yourself to do that, but what you\u2019re allowing what you allowed yourself to do was to not be gentle on yourself, to not acknowledge the positive, and then to be harsh on yourself for succumbing to an old habit of harshness for putting <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N201B51\">yourself down for putting yourself down. Instead of thinking \u2013 \u201clook how hard it is for me, sad that it isn\u2019t easy, but let me keep making effort, just like I would to defend a five year old, one of my students. Let me do it for me, Jessa. I want to say that again. That you made yourself suffer about <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N201B52\">your suffering. So you\u2019re beating yourself up and then you\u2019re beating yourself up for beating yourself up. Let\u2019s do a trifecta. How about beating yourself up for beating yourself up for beating yourself up. Let\u2019s go all the way. Let\u2019s really bruise Jessa (joking). Yay. I mean this is this...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201B7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m crying and laughing at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201B9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re laughing. You\u2019ve used up all my dry tissues. Let me see if I I have one more but now if I sneeze I\u2019ll have to use your sleeve. You\u2019re not wearing sleeves so that\u2019ll be hard. There you go. Good that you\u2019re laughing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201BB\">CLIENT: Well it is humorous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Yes \u2013 good that you recognize that ! It is also fine that you\u2019re crying, and you just said well it is humorous, which you probably would not have said to me about ten minutes ago. So again, in a short time we can see progress when you slow yourself down and are willing to look at it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N201BD1\">take in all the facts and are willing to have compassion for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N201BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N201BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201BF\">CLIENT: No, but I think there\u2019s a bigger piece though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201C1\">THERAPIST: What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201C3\">CLIENT: I know what it is. I know what it is. Willing to reflect can I really say it because I think it just sort of all came together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201C5\">THERAPIST: Say it now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201C7\">CLIENT: Looking at what I have to say. See, this is the hardest this is the hardest thing for me to look at is that it\u2019s taking the time to look at what I have to say because all of my life and my tendencies I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m doing it now is that I\u2019ve if there was a problem it was assumed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201C71\">go to mom and dad. And that, I think, is the new, when I talked about what\u2019s new, is that I have an opinion, too, and I have my feelings, too, and I don\u2019t think that that was acknowledged in the past. It wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t it\u2019s not that I think, it was not. And I could be as extreme to say that it really <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201C72\">was not ever because the attitude from them was \u201cyou don\u2019t know\u201d. It was you just can\u2019t possibly know like we know. And it was that extreme. So I think that that when slowing myself down probably didn\u2019t happen very often because it was problem, run, run, run. There was a problem? Okay, run, run, <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201C73\">run. You can go figure out. And so that\u2019s my it\u2019s like that push pull with...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Familiar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201CB\">CLIENT: Well that and also the push pull of oh, and then I go everybody else\u2019s opinion, everybody else\u2019s opinion, their opinion\u2019s right, so I\u2019m going to go to them. I\u2019m going to go to them. I\u2019m going to go to them. It\u2019s like crisis mode because that was what I was so used to doing. And so I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201CB1\">that this is a very new territory in a sense that I\u2019m like wait a second, I and then when I was doing you might think one might think well, you work and you\u2019re doing this, but there\u2019s a really big piece of me that feels that I have been able to sort of, I don\u2019t want to use the word perfect, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201CB2\">have been so trained in what I\u2019ve done that that\u2019s the area where I feel I can go to work and put on my big girl shoes, so to speak, and say oh I know what I\u2019m doing here because I\u2019ve been trained and you haven\u2019t. But then when it comes to just everyday life, just regular everyday life, I then and <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201CB3\">that\u2019s why I think I put the I\u2019m an exerciser, I\u2019m a counselor, because the label makes me feel as if oh, I know what I\u2019m doing. When really it\u2019s just reflecting on my no matter what it is I\u2019m entitled to an opinion, and I think that that\u2019s the hard part, is acknowledging that I\u2019m entitled to an <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201CB4\">opinion despite whether I never felt that I was entitled because it\u2019s not too late to, I guess, have my own opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Could you just say that again really strongly for me to hear again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201CF\">CLIENT: Without tears, because I feel like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201D1\">THERAPIST: No \u2013 not without tears, tears are allowed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N201D3\">CLIENT: Okay, but which part, because I said a lot. So I don\u2019t just that I\u2019m entitled to have an opinion, and I don\u2019t want to always be reflecting or running or going to somebody else for that opinion, that I can slow down and be able to it\u2019s nice to be able to go to other people as a either a <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201D31\">support or a possible second opinion or some or go to a professional that maybe has more knowledge in something, like somebody would come to me because I am trained in what I do, but that I don\u2019t have to run for every opinion that I have and that if I don\u2019t that if I have an uncomfortable feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N201D32\">that I can reflect on my own self and that I don\u2019t have to pick up a phone or feel that I don\u2019t have an answer for myself.

And the fact that though it was not a good thing, it wasn\u2019t awful or irreparable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201DB\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019ve been going through those motions of the acceptance, and I think that that\u2019s been a little hard because you don\u2019t know if you want to say, I hate my parents and I can\u2019t stand them for what they did or if you just want to say, this is what happened and I\u2019m not going to sit here and <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N201DB1\">go on and on about how much I hate what happened. I\u2019m just going to accept that this is what it was and that I can do something about it and not be so stuck. [01:01:02.05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201DD\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s helpful to make the distinction, as you did, within that one question of the issue of hating my parents or hating what they did. I think hating what they did is a healthy thing to do and that doesn\u2019t mean you hate them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201DF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t hate them. I won\u2019t hate them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201E1\">THERAPIST: But it would be a little strange not to dislike anything they did. Now I also encourage, if you\u2019re willing, as you\u2019re willing, you to feel some compassion for them in that what they did they did in ignorance of the negative outcomes for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201E3\">CLIENT: They did it in ignorance, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201E5\">THERAPIST: But before you go...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201E7\">CLIENT: And they continue to do it. They continue to do it. It\u2019s not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201E9\">THERAPIST: And probably they will keep on doing so unless they find a reason to change, but in the meantime...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201EB\">CLIENT: They don\u2019t have REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201ED\">THERAPIST: They don\u2019t think they need it, probably, or feel any need to change. They\u2019re convinced, perhaps, that they\u2019re right a lot of the time. In any case, what you do have the power to control is your thinking and behavior, you don\u2019t have the power to create certainty about practically any outer <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N201ED1\">things or all things: I don\u2019t think any human does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201EF\">CLIENT: Nobody does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Well, yes, I mean there are little things, such as for example that if you\u2019re making a cake you can be pretty certain that things will turn out a certain way if you follow the recipe well, but even then, quirky things can happen. So looking for or demanding certainty is not helpful, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N201F11\">it can be okay to consider circumstances and which have more probability, high probability, of happening. Where you do have control is of your thinking and actions and in the creation of your feelings. And you\u2019ve described today and on other occasions how difficult it is for you to do, especially, what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N201F12\">not familiar. And what I\u2019d like to encourage you to do is to work on embracing what isn\u2019t familiar.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P17-N201F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"16\"><span data-id=\"P17-N201F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P18-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P18-N201F3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll do that.

I mean I this is something I\u2019ve known for a long time, but I don\u2019t know if I I think going home for the holidays sort of sealed the deal a little bit in terms of okay, Jessa, I think that\u2019s a being empowered, a piece of being empowered <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N201F71\">anyway, I think, is being able to reflect and to be able to go to yourself for different things because if you are constantly I mean a baby doesn\u2019t have that option. They have to cry and be able to get what their needs met, whether it\u2019s to be fed or to be changed. They don\u2019t have that luxury of <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N201F72\">being able to express what they feel. But I think I do. I think it\u2019s a luxury, and I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P18-N201F9\">THERAPIST: You think what\u2019s a luxury?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P18-N201FB\">CLIENT: Well being able to express what I look at it that way, that it\u2019s a luxury because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P18-N201FD\">THERAPIST: Okay, well, and I suggest you rethink that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N201FF\">CLIENT: Well that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.

Because by the way, you might <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2023D1\">be having a really off day and advise them to go jump on their head and they say Jessa, you\u2019re the best in what you advise.

I think it was the first time in my life that I ever felt that I could do something. I don\u2019t think I ever felt that I not invalidated but that I could make something happen.

Well I sometimes think that the body I the body gives signs of different things and so what I\u2019m basically what I\u2019m saying is because he\u2019s writing that in an e-mail and I\u2019m reading it and saying oh, that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m trying maybe I\u2019m not explaining correctly <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2024F1\">and I\u2019m like well God just said go to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20251\">THERAPIST: Treating the doctor as if he has the ultimate knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20253\">CLIENT: Right. The ultimate knowledge [inaudible] and of course this is his area of expertise. I understand that but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the be all end all. Or that it\u2019s the be all end all he hasn\u2019t even examined me. He\u2019s looked at films, he\u2019s heard what I\u2019ve said, but he hasn\u2019t actually seen <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N202531\">me physically and done an examination that way. There are other factors, there\u2019s other people involved. So I think it\u2019s I think always believing that somebody else has the answer other than myself. And there is no answer or certainty.

I think when it comes to the homework piece I think that\u2019s where I once you when our session is over, and I go to do the homework and I sit down, but I think this time I think that\u2019s when I start conjuring up some of those thoughts. But I think that what <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N202771\">I\u2019m going to do differently this week is that I\u2019m not, for the homework, which you haven\u2019t told me what it is yet, but when I do it, I think what I\u2019m going to do is just for a few minutes, instead of looking back now and realizing probably the way that I was doing it was that I was trying to be perfect <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N202772\">at it. I realize that now. I don\u2019t think I realized that before. I really didn\u2019t. There was a lot of things I don\u2019t I think I did on some superficial level but not really.

Look, I did it. As opposed to doing it for me, I\u2019m doing it for you. And I don\u2019t want to do it.

I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do when I go to attack my homework this coming week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20289\">THERAPIST: \u201cAttack\u201d your homework. Attack your homework. Grrr.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2028B\">CLIENT: Well when I do the homework I think I\u2019m going to do it, this time around, just with my own thoughts and my own feelings and see what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2028D\">THERAPIST: About time Jessa!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2028F\">CLIENT: So and then we\u2019ll talk obviously next week because I\u2019ll be able to discuss with you whatever came of the probably the homework that I\u2019m going to be doing for myself, and however it comes it comes and I\u2019m not going I\u2019m really going to work on not focusing on it being the right homework <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N2028F1\">or the homework that Debbie is expecting or anything like that because that\u2019s just there\u2019s no point then. I mean there really isn\u2019t that much of a point if that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20291\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20293\">CLIENT: I mean there\u2019s a point but there\u2019s not a point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20295\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s against your healthy goals, when one of your restricting irrational beliefs is the need for approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20297\">CLIENT: That one really gets into murky territory when...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P21-N20299\">THERAPIST: If you let it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2029B\">CLIENT: Do is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2029D\">THERAPIST: Yes, it\u2019s very common, highly common. It\u2019s yes, one of the most common.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P21-N2029F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s funny though because we don\u2019t judge ourselves like we judge others. We don\u2019t judge others like we judge or damn ourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202A1\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t. Can\u2019t speak for all others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202A3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t, yeah, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202A5\">THERAPIST: You and a whole lot of other people, but the healthier people continue to make effort to be comfortable in their own skins, to accept themselves unconditionally as fallible humans, and they make effort to do so with other people. Not to force themselves to like ugly behavior of other people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N202A51\">and to still fight for justice if there\u2019s some abuse there on any level, but the healthy thing to aspire to do more of more of the time as the fallible humans that we are is to work on separating a person\u2019s behavior from their essential worth, which is there. Whether it\u2019s your own or that of other <\/span><span data-id=\"P21-N202A52\">people. And yes, so this need of approval was one of the beliefs bringing you down, keeping you down, making you suffer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202A7\">CLIENT: And I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not a tendency that won\u2019t come up for me. It\u2019s something I have to work on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202A9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s exactly right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202AB\">CLIENT: I have to work on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P21-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202AD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right \u2013 if you want change. And so when the thought rears its familiar head, instead of saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a candidate for REBT\u201d, the healthy, mature, adult thing to say might be \u2013\u201cwell, that was to be expected, that familiar thought ... But it is not true. I do not need Debbie\u2019s approval\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P21-N202AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"20\"><span data-id=\"P21-N202AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":21,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"21\" data-page=\"21\">\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202AF\">CLIENT: Right. Debbie, you\u2019re such a character.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202B1\">THERAPIST: So how are you feeling right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202B3\">CLIENT: Definitely better than I was feeling earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202B5\">THERAPIST: And was it because of my magic, or because of a change in your thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202B7\">CLIENT: No, it was because of a change in my thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202B9\">THERAPIST: And are you someone who can benefit from ongoing effort of applying REBT?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202BB\">CLIENT: Of course. I\u2019m...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202BD\">THERAPIST: Okay, so you\u2019ve unfired yourself from the job of doing REBT. You\u2019ve reinstated yourself. Good, I support that. Great. Good job. If it helps you have in mind at times an image either of your most vulnerable student at school who you help, who you would go to great lengths to protect and <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N202BD1\">to have compassion for and you\u2019d want to teach him or her compassion for themselves, not hard for you to do, is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202BF\">CLIENT: To picture...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202C1\">THERAPIST: To picture them and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202C5\">THERAPIST: Okay. Have it as a goal to have that equal amount of self-protection that the protection that you would give them to have for yourself and compassion for yourself. Even, and especially, when you don\u2019t do as well as you think you should or don\u2019t do as well as you want. It\u2019s just healthy <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N202C51\">to want to do well. At your homework and anything else. And would it be a stretch to also suggest that you pull out a picture of you as a young child looking really vulnerable and innocent?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202C7\">CLIENT: Well I did that over the weekend. I was watching videos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202C9\">THERAPIST: And maybe you could have a still photo of you as a young girl that you can look at when you catch yourself forgetting to have compassion on adult, big adult Jessa, who you demand better do the right thing. Look at this innocent young one who got all these wrong messages and who suffered as <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N202C91\">a result. But the good news is her spirit lives in adult you and you can work on having more compassion yourself. So you can do both. Think of a vulnerable student you would go all out to protect and think of young you, and it\u2019s time to go all out to protect you. So how about framing a photo of you <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N202C92\">as a child. Would you do that and look at it every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202CB\">CLIENT: Framing it, meaning put it some place in the apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202CD\">THERAPIST: Putting it yes, somewhere. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202D1\">THERAPIST: Will you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202D3\">CLIENT: Yeah, [inaudible] have an actual still photo. I have videos but a still...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202D5\">THERAPIST: Can you find it and print it and you\u2019ll find a way. There is a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll figure it out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202D9\">THERAPIST: Okay, so what would be good in addition to remaining on it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202DB\">CLIENT: Can we just pause is there I just because I have a feeling my sorry. [stops tape]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202DD\">THERAPIST: So I just paused this recorder and then I unpaused it. I paused it because you heard your cell phone and you had an arrangement to meet someone in about actually five minutes ago. And instead of letting it go to voice mail, you answered it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202DF\">CLIENT: No, it was... our meeting<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P22-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202E1\">THERAPIST: Yes, five minutes ago. If it\u2019s ten-to now, or five-to now. So ten minutes, about ten minutes ago. And you wanted me to pause it so you could answer that phone. And I just think it may be an example of your immediate tendency to placate, soothe, make sure the other person is all right. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P22-N202E11\">my hunch is that it was an example of your putting them before you. Because we\u2019re completing now what I think has been one of our more important sessions in terms of your self-revelations.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P22-N202E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"21\"><span data-id=\"P22-N202E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":22,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"22\" data-page=\"22\">\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202E3\">CLIENT: You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202E5\">THERAPIST: So I am pointing out here your tendency, which will continue if you don\u2019t stop it, to not put you first. Now I\u2019m not encouraging you to become a selfish narcissist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202E7\">CLIENT: No, I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202E9\">THERAPIST: But there are times that merit you putting you first, especially when it\u2019s not that important to attend to another as it is to keep focus on yourself. It\u2019s not ideal to be late but if it\u2019s a few for good reason it\u2019s no tragedy either. And we\u2019re not talking about an appointment professionally. <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N202E91\">It\u2019s a casual dinner with your best friend. And you put her first right now. Before you. I\u2019m not reprimanding you, am I. Do you realize that I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202EB\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think you are reprimanding me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202ED\">THERAPIST: Do you see I\u2019m pointing it out, for your benefit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202EF\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202F1\">THERAPIST: Which is how you can start thinking. When you notice \u201coh darnit, I\u2019ve done this again, this thought that I instead of oh, I\u2019m not a candidate or I\u2019ll it\u2019s like oh gosh, I did it again. Now look at that\u201d. Observe, without self-damning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202F3\">CLIENT: Well I was going to continue well my whole thought was that I was going to continue with what we were doing. I just thought that I would call to say, I\u2019m in the middle of something, when you get back let me come. So is that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202F5\">THERAPIST: Yes, it\u2019s putting aside this for that, politely. Okay. So there has been a lot of things for you to observe tonight about yourself. Have you felt at any point judged by me in any negative way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202F7\">CLIENT: No. I haven\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202F9\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve been pointing out things that are not helpful to you. That\u2019s an example of unconditional other acceptance. I point it out to you because I care about your wellbeing and our goal together of helping you help yourself get over this anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202FB\">CLIENT: Gotcha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202FD\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t put you down for mistakes. I point them out. Unconditional self acceptance is you doing that to you, for you. I hope regarding much of what we did tonight that you will remember not only what I said but the way I said it and the way I paused you when you weren\u2019t completing a thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N202FD1\">process or when you were thinking in an unhelpful way. So to finish off, what is the homework that will be very helpful for you to do between now and our next session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P23-N202FF\">CLIENT: Oh, you\u2019re asking me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20301\">THERAPIST: I am asking you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20303\">CLIENT: (pause) Maybe to (pause) actually do to do an ABC, an ABCD type thing, but to actually do one, just one, but set maybe even I don\u2019t want to say set a timer because that\u2019s restricting me, but in a way well really, to set a timer for myself, to say that I\u2019m giving myself 30 minutes to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N203031\">one. In other words instead of just saying, oh I did 60 and isn\u2019t that so great, instead focusing on just one but actually disputing it and disputing it and disputing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20305\">THERAPIST: Disputing your irrational beliefs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P23-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20307\">CLIENT: Disputing my irrational belief but spending 30 minutes on one instead of trying because I think what I\u2019ve been trying to do this whole time is get more than one done. And so I just do them quickly because I\u2019m like oh, I have this one and then I have this one and it\u2019s like and do this and <\/span><span data-id=\"P23-N203071\">do that and try this and try that. And I think maybe just doing one but doing it for an extended period of time and actually reflecting and dissecting it, and instead of worrying about just getting the next one done and the next one done.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P23-N20306-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"22\"><span data-id=\"P23-N20306-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":23,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561796\" data-realpage=\"23\" data-page=\"23\">\n<p data-id=\"P24-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P24-N20309\">THERAPIST: Right, so that\u2019s homework number one. And my second broad suggestion not only for this time between now and next session but for the rest of your life also, is to continue to practice being more watchful of your thinking and feelings and taking time, pausing the way we\u2019ve done a number of <\/span><span data-id=\"P24-N203091\">times tonight, to consider priorities and focusing on the priority and noticing other distractions and telling yourself I\u2019ll get to the others later but first I finish this. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P24-N2030B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P24-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P24-N2030D\">THERAPIST: And working on greater compassion, unconditional self-acceptance, not needing certainty, not needing to do things perfectly. They\u2019re your focus points, or some of them.
