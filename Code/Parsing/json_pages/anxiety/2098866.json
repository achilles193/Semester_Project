Which I know, some of it could be related to the ECT, I wouldn't even know how much. But I'm sort of thinking that there's some way the cumulative effect <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200531\">might be that you are not being here. And then, I thought well maybe because that's because you don't want to be. I don't mean that to sound like on some level you sound like you have to work, you haven't said anyway that you have to work especially hard to get yourself here. So it's clearly not at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200532\">that level. Yeah, I'm not sure why. I mean maybe it's because if we talk about things, we're likely to talk about things that are painful, maybe even in a painful way, and you don't want that.

It's not necessarily bad. I mean, it's bad that you feel bad, that you feel bad. But, I mean, for some reason the ECT is having we can kind of chalk some of it up to that. But not remembering things here, in a way that's pretty striking and also different, leaves <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200B11\">me, I mean I think the changes with ECT are probably more global than that, you know?
