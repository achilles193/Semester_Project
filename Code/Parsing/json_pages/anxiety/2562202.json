I feel like at work, to be productive and doing a lot, it\u2019s got to match up with [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:43), but I don\u2019t know. I wish I could do things more calmly where I\u2019m just not so affected by it.  I feel like it\u2019s always like I either have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">to be wrapped up or where I don\u2019t do anything at all. It\u2019s always kind of in between. (pause)  I guess I just am fed up and not really feeling good about things and I don\u2019t really know how to manage myself or slow down, but not so much that I\u2019m not doing anything.  (long pause) I guess I just want change, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">but I feel like I\u2019m unable to and am stuck, not able to let some things go.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Let me be clear. I don\u2019t think you have bipolar disorder, otherwise I would have said something by now. But there are some features of what you\u2019re describing that are a little like that in more of a psycho-dynamic and a kind of diagnostic sense. What I mean is I think that kind of amped up, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">energized state bears some resemblance to a mild manic state, in that I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what it actually is in a diagnostic sense, but I think it\u2019s like that in that I think when you\u2019re feeling that way, there is a collection of feelings and fantasies that go along with it.  I think you tend to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">a fairly narrow focus, like you don\u2019t let a lot in in terms of bad feelings or doubts, in a way. And I think it probably feels like there are no problems \u2013 or maybe there is only one problem, which is that something might not get done. I imagine that you sort of have to shut all of that other stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">out and have, I guess, some idea about yourself being able to kind of get through anything.  That\u2019s sort of the mode that you\u2019re in when you\u2019re productive in that way, but it\u2019s a little fragile or a little [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:18) and things pull you out of it \u2013 interactions with people, bad things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F4\">happening \u2013 that kind of put you into that other mode where you\u2019re feeling more overwhelmed, more stuck, not as motivated, but also it\u2019s a much more inclusive mode in that you can feel worried about a variety of things. You can feel upset, confused, sad, lacking conviction \u2013 all these things that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F5\">can\u2019t get in touch with really in the more energized mode.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Yeah.  (pause) I agree. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I guess the reason I mention it is because I think, especially in the more productive mode, some of the fantasies that go along with it are not as obvious as when you\u2019re in that.  For example, and maybe I\u2019m wrong, but it doesn\u2019t feel like you have limitations or it feels like a much less <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">limiting mode. I think in some ways that\u2019s true and in other ways it\u2019s not true. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I feel like either way, in either mode, there is this lack of enjoyment. It\u2019s not like I should be enjoying everything [in the line of work] (ph?), but there is always this wanting more and I\u2019m not sure how to do that. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I think when you get like that, you always feel very much on the line, like it\u2019s a very performative way of being; and there is a lot of anxiety that goes with that which doesn\u2019t have much to do with enjoying what you\u2019re doing. (long pause)  [I guess I\u2019m just thinking what I do because with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">my anxiety,] (ph?) I need that to remember things I have to do or to get me to do it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562202\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: I guess when you talk about it, it\u2019s almost like the boss is right over your shoulder when you feel that way, like standing right over your shoulder \u2013 which makes it awfully easy to remember what it is that you have to do, but also feels, I think, intrusive and exposed. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I know that I\u2019m not really answering your question. I know that your question also comes from feeling, I think, that things are really quite intolerable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I guess I\u2019m just kind of stuck on what to do or what to change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Okay, so here is the moment then that I think you really want the same thing with me. I think you are probably feeling like close to coming apart in thinking about what we\u2019re talking about and are sort of reaching for the same scenario, where I am then kind of over your shoulder saying, \u201cDo <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">this; do that. Here\u2019s how you need to fix that,\u201d because that is the thing that helps hold you together.  If I were to tell you that, it would be, I\u2019m sure, such a relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess I just kind of feel like I don\u2019t want to keep doing the same thing, but I also feel like I\u2019m just going to, like it\u2019s inevitable. [But things are going to stay the same.] (ph?) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: I guess you were also saying yesterday, although I don\u2019t know if this applies now, that you feel as though you are wanting to go about this in a more childish way and I am wanting you to go about this in a more \u2013 and I\u2019m thinking about this from your point of view now \u2013 mature emotion-facing way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I just want a fix or something to hold onto when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed or beginning to so I\u2019m not completely taken over by this feeling of anxiety and stress.  I guess I kind of feel like something else needs to happen or . . . I don\u2019t know. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I imagine that you feel me abandoning you and that\u2019s also part of what makes you feel overwhelmed. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just kind of a hopeless feeling or nothing is ever enough. It doesn\u2019t feel like what I would describe as abandonment. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s more like you\u2019re too needy and no one can help you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Maybe like you\u2019re too far gone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right. I always feel like I\u2019m missing something and I\u2019m not sure why I can\u2019t just direct the energy or motivation to fix it or be better or [good enough] (ph?) or kind of slow things down to enjoy them more. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Although, I think your feeling better is predicated on feeling, in this example, in a different relation to me in which I\u2019m telling you what you need to do. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s a temporary relief, kind of, so I have something else to focus on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Like it\u2019s coping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right.  I guess what I\u2019m kind of feeling is like I\u2019m overwhelmed and not able to do very much. It\u2019s like kind of a fantasy and it kind of helps me get motivated for the next day, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s not healthy or wrong. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562202\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: My sense is that when you are feeling that way and you are moving and getting things done, it doesn\u2019t feel like just coping, it feels like you\u2019re more together and things are better in a way. I imagine that, even though you\u2019re not feeling that way now, you\u2019re enough in touch with what it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">like to know that when you\u2019re feeling that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like coping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I guess it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what else to do. I feel like I have to do that, otherwise I won\u2019t do anything. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: I am clear that that is the mode in which you get things done and if you are not in that mode, you don\u2019t; and that getting things done matters. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I guess the feeling is that if I\u2019m not going to be productive, I\u2019m not enough; I need to do more and I just don\u2019t know.  It seems like the only way, if I\u2019m coping with that feeling of being inadequate. I don\u2019t know how else to deal with it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I guess I think it\u2019s pretty inextricably linked to the relation in your mind with another person in relation to whom you feel inadequate and who can also give you hope or help you have hope that you could feel better.  So at work, feeling that, compared to what you need to do and maybe compared <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">to what Bryan thinks you should be able to get done, you feel inadequate. I guess it\u2019s probably your own judgment in a way, but I think also kind of in his eyes; but I don\u2019t necessarily know he feels that way. Then I think when you feel him over your shoulder and feel like you\u2019re very aware of and very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">focused on the things you need to get done, there is a kind of hope there that you\u2019ll prove yourself or redeem yourself somewhat.  (long pause)  With me, I think it gets a little complicated because (long pause) . . .  I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it. It\u2019s something about, I think, feeling in here <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200453\">like the demand is sort of impossible or unclear from me. You\u2019re just supposed to deal with this differently or be better about it or somehow not have the problem you are wanting help feeling with. Something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:21) (pause) With work stuff, it just feels like if I can\u2019t redeem myself I can\u2019t work the way I want to be able to [ ] I should do it if I can do it and obviously I can.  I\u2019m just trying to redeem myself or do it all over or [do much.] (ph?) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: [I see. So the redemption is impossible.] (ph?) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like I\u2019m not able to process, in terms of what we do in here, or deal with the things that are happening. As much as I might want to, it\u2019s just kind of like everything I do kind of makes it worse.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I guess I am aware that often in talking about these things you feel more upset, at least in the moment, and confused. I wasn\u2019t aware that it overall felt like it was making things worse. Is that true? (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just the feeling that things don\u2019t change. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: It does seem to me that you are able to talk much more closely about this. I am not trying to argue that things are getting better if it doesn\u2019t feel like they are getting better or that any of this stuff feels easy or like it makes a whole lot of sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562202\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: I think when I leave here everything kind of snaps back.
