I went to... So I went to the same stylist that I had eight months ago which is the last time I got my haircut and it was just a very funny thing. She's just very cheerful and bubbly and I'm very cheerful and bubbly. I feel like that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">to be expected of me. And she's like, \"Hey, how have you been?\" I'm like, \"Well, you know, it's been an interesting six months. How have you been?\" She's like, \"Yeah, I've been up and down also.\" And so we're chatting in this very cheerful bubbly way and she's like, \"Yeah, well, you know, by boyfriend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">of five years cheated on me and stole a bunch of stuff and now we're broken up.\" (LAUGHTER) It's like, \"Yeah, well, I was unemployed for six months because of medical issues and lost all my memory.

(PAUSE) I guess this might be exactly the same thing I said last week but I feel like job hits are both harder and more rewarding the longer I do it. (SIGH) (PAUSE) You know, it's like the kids are so great. We have so much fun and they're wonderful and like the baby smiles when she sees <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D1\">me now which is a big deal.

It's like I came home from work yesterday and starting like really, really crying over shoes, I think. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I think (inaudible at 00:06:31) tired. (PAUSE) It's hard for me to think of it as like, as something that I'll still be doing next week or like it's hard for me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">to think of it as like a job that will still be there in a month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">You know, it's not... I don't think it's because I don't want to be doing it in a month.

Well, I'll probably be here next month but I might not be here next month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">That is hard. Like I don't... (PAUSE) I can't really talk to James about being stressed out by the fact that I don't know where we'll be in six months because he is stressed out about that also. You know, I don't think it would be any feeling that's putting adverse pressure on him to say, \"Oh, by the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200791\">way, your job search is detrimental to me.\" But it's really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: I had to have a physical today (inaudible at 00:09:49) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) The... (PAUSE) You know, so like you go in and there's like an intake with the nurse or whoever and then they like hand you a gown and then they leave and then the doctor comes in and like does the pelvic exam. I realized as I was changing, I was like, \"Wow, this moment of like, 'Here, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200811\">put on these strange clothes and sit here and wait for us to do weird things to your body that you don't really want.' Like I'm very good at this.\" (LAUGHTER) Like, \"This feels remarkably familiar.\" But I don't know. I like my doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: I just... (PAUSE) Yeah. I didn't like that. She asked about my (inaudible at 00:11:19) And lie I wasn't expecting that. I didn't... I don't think it threw me that much. I sort of... Yeah. (inaudible at 00:11:41) (PAUSE) She said, \"So are you feeling better about yourself?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">And I said, \"That's a complicated question.\" And she kind of laughed and said, \"Yeah, okay.\" (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. I feel like the sorts of concern that she's trying to show if I were in a different place or different mood would really hit me in the wrong way. But today, at least, I kind of absorbed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200871\">it better. I was like, \"She's really trying to... She's trying to express concern. She's just necessarily very good at it.\" Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) \"Are you feeling better about yourself now?\" (LAUGHTER) I said I was feeling better now but I thought feeling better about myself was going to be a bit of a longer process. (PAUSE) Yeah. I guess all of today is like that, like things that would be much, things that would have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B1\">much harder on me, like... (SIGH) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559792\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">In a different time or at a different... I ran into my friend from the coffee shop, Tamara (ph) when I was going to get my hair cut. And then she was about to start a shift so I went in a got a cup of tea and chatter a bit with her after the haircut. I wouldn't be able to do that. But it was okay. Yeah. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">So I'm going to go get a drink with her on Monday. She's leaving the coffee shop finally which is awesome, starting... (PAUSE) I don't remember exactly what she's starting but it's some children's counseling program in the city. So, yeah. She's starting something that she actually wants to be doing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D2\">That's really cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: So this guy, this guy from Brown I did some like copy, did some editing work for him at some point.

The doctor was sort of like resilient in a way that you felt at the doctor too. And I imagine you are also worried that like... I mean, you sort of feel a sense of fragility over this.

And also you're <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD1\">worried that I'm going to knock it down somehow or saying something that's going to make it or hurt your feelings (inaudible at 00:24:11) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200BC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559792\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">And with your question, you're not sure if you, you're not sure how to protect yourself or sort of... Well, I don't know. It can be difficult (inaudible at 00:24:43)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Sorry. (PAUSE) I don't know if I'm thinking less clearly than usual or if I'm just less able to start talking before I figure out what I want to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: I don't know.

(PAUSE) I feel like in some ways my doing well and feeling good about where my life was sort of rested on not noticing that I had a pattern of having that sort of crash after a while and so I... It's sort of like the more I, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">the more good things happen and the more I feel like I'm moving toward a good place, the more anxious I am about not being able to protect that. And so, in some ways, like today, I sort of showed up and was like, \"Wow, I'm in a very good mood.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">And then kind of immediately thought, \"Yeah, but I'm not...\" It's like I'm not in a really good mood all the way through and so maybe I want to talk about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: I don't want to...

(SIGH) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">On the one hand, like, I don't want to be happy in a way that's founded on delusion and on the other hand, I don't want worrying about the future inevitable crash to keep me from actually being happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: In terms of like saying things that push you into a didactic role, I wonder how much of that is feeling like... (SIGH) This is less interesting than what's in my head. (LAUGHTER) Yeah, I... (SIGH) See like, if I can just phrase the question exactly right, maybe I can understand it better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Do you mean (inaudible at 00:32:09) pushing me into a didactic role but rather that you're framing the questions in a way that helps you think about them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah but I think that those are connected also in a way that (inaudible at 00:32:31) Yeah. A lot of times when I have trouble talking in here I think it's because I'm revising and revising and revising before I can say something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: You know, I do like... (PAUSE) I don't know. I feel like I regret it when I don't revise. You know, like I'll say things that I imagine will be hurtful to you or that I don't feel like, or actually what I mean and (inaudible at 00:33:45) Plus I just hate it when I say things and I imagine it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E11\">would be hurtful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I sort of... I'm not intending this to be a question for you but I wonder a lot about how you protect yourself in your job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I see.

I'm telling you about these things. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. And not having to keep it (inaudible at 00:35:47) Like what you were saying just prior to this about, you know, not wanting to be happy with something deluded or unable to be happy anticipating the crash. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559792\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) That's sort of like what we talked about trust a while back. I would have said I felt really safe here after like the first couple of weeks. So I sort of... (PAUSE) I don't know. But I think you're right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: That's good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: You weren't planning on leaving private practice in the next six months are you?

(LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Are you pretty scared about that?

Like I have this job that I really like with people that I really like.

Therefore, these bad things that you're afraid of won't happen.\" But like that doesn't actually follow either. (LAUGHTER) So... I don't know what to do. (PAUSE) Yeah. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201091\">like I'm sort of trying to get used to constantly like staring down the barrel. I'm not sure that metaphor is going anywhere. But staring into that awful thing you're afraid of might actual happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">I just... I have to make that okay somehow. (PAUSE) I know that like people do that. I know that, you know, actually driving on the interstate is a pretty good metaphor. I don't... I'm like... I'm mostly... I have to stare at it every time. Every time I get into the car it's the most dangerous part <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B1\">of my life. Like that is the most dangerous thing I do every day and I do it and I'm okay with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: We should probably stop.
