What's up? It's nice. Yeah. This is all good, this 3 o'clock thing? Way better. I feel a little more rounded. Woke up with a tension headache though, so I didn't sleep well last night. It took me a while to-and I had like a weird panic attack after practice yesterday? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">I went to my friend's bar. Just me and him having beers. I don't know, I suddenly felt really weird. I suddenly felt it was like an old school, slightly weird anxiety, I felt suddenly like hyper-aware of myself and like just felt weird and a little bit off. So weird. I got over it, but ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Something in particular you were aware of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Nah, I think it's just the state I'm in right now. I still not-I (exhale) this is just unbelievable. I just-there's a way-I come down the street and I turn on, what is thator whatever right there. So, I'm going down there-that's a two-way street.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Isn't it? I think-I'm pretty sure it's a two-way street. Yeah, because I'm pretty sure I've been down there when the snow was bad and cars were turning in and-I'm going to double check but I'm pretty sure it's a two-way street. Two cars are in front of me, I just casually get in the left lane <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">in a two-way street and as I'm turning like, \u2018what the fuck am I doing?' Like I'm just completely preoccupied with too much stuff and now like the stuff we've talked about and feeling edgy and-I had another fucking band cancel for the record release. I mean it's in two fucking weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: That's disappointing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: It's unbeliev-I just posted-I know it's not a big deal, it's not like-it's just venting but on Facebook I was like, \u2018you know what? Hey, people, if you've even a sliver of an inkling, like, that you might not be able to do a show, then fucking say no. I mean I know things happen or whatever, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">but two cancellations in the last-like come on, man, it's uncool. People are working hard to make this happen. I don't know, I'm just frustrated. I don't know. And then yesterday like I was, we were talking about the drummer again and he's just kind of, he's good but then on some songs he just doesn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">get it and I don't know, I start feeling like I'm on overload for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">(Pause): [00:03:24 00:03:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: It sounds like there are a lot of kind of psychological balls in the air-it's hard to keep them all juggling, keep track of them all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Internally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So there is more on your plate, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am trying to remind myself that I mean it's all good things, I mean, even if a band did cancel, if worse comes to worse there's going to be a show with three bands, but there's going to be a fucking show and people are going to come out to see us. I mean it's our record release <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">show, so. I don't know. If worse comes to worse after us we'll throw on an iPod and have a dance party. I don't fucking know, but yeah, like I try to remind myself that I was doing this this morning and my head was just killing me. But, yeah, I just don't know. I don't know if it's that things are just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">going well and there's something in me trying to just draw me back to it's so, I'm not used to this, that's trying to pull me back to feeling all fucked up and you know, just shut myself in. I don't know. I mean, yeah. The drummer's not whatever, but we've played shows and they've all been great. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200313\">mean, we'll revisit it after the show and figure it out. If I need to try someone else out, I will. You know, it's kind of not, you know what I mean, no one's holding a gun-like I feel like that's my mom's kind of thinking. Do you know what I mean? It's my band. I put this band together. If I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200314\">feel like this just isn't working out I'll talk to him and explain and whatever and if it kind of can't change, then just try some other drummers out. It's not ideal, but that shit happens all the time. I think, yeah, I'm jut not used to all this stuff and with stuff comes stresses, you know. Things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200315\">happen, you know, like much worse every day. I mean they're trying to do things, it doesn't work out and things get cancelled, I don't know. I think it's a combination of I'm not used to it and that old voice kind of feeds on that stuff or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098520\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: There are edges of the old voice but it actually sounds like even more so. There is, that you, because things have felt better you've been busier. You've been doing more things which means there are more things to be on top of, there are more things that are going to go minerly (ph) wrong <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">because that's what happens to everybody. Right? It doesn't all go right. Some things go wrong every time you take on any one thing. So, there are things you have to worry about, everything's going well, there are things you have to worry about, but more of it in a way. So, it's the, your mind's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">used to the ordinariness of daily stresses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think that's what it is. Because it's used to catastrophizing (sp?) everything and turning it physical and whatever, just totally like defeatist or whatever. Now it has opportunity to do that because there's all this stuff going on. So, that side of me forgets that it's like what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">you said, like it's all good stuff and yeah, some stuff might kind of shit happens, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Of course it does. And even ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: But it's not ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: ...if you are pursuing any adventure, things come up that are frustrating, disappointing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I think the funny thing though is that I'm even handling it. Like I already put out the voice in my head like, \u2018I don't give a shit' and I was like, \u2018well, should I put this on?' and you know what? Fuck it. I don't like Facebook, but it's a perfect place to vent about something like that. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">have like 2,000 friends on there. I don't give a fuck if they see it or not. It's just not cool, you know? So in a way that's very, it's not like I'm cowering in the, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098520\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: And, I'm already like, fuck it, if that's the way it's going to be I'll even pay someone 50 bucks out of my own pocket to come and you know we'll bill it as a CD release show\/dance party. After we're done we can do an hour of whatever. I don't know, it's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: That's the part that doesn't feel old voicey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: No, no, no, that's not old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: It really feels sounds more like dealing with the new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Well, the old voice would have been like, \u2018oh, this isn't meant to happen. This means the show's going to go totally awful, it's going to be all fucked up and bad, there aren't going to be a lot of people there.' It would just find ways to pile on instead of being just like this is just what <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">happens. I mean, it happens, musicians are flaky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And even being able to be irritated at them for canceling rather than...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: ...feeling down on yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: And go all down on them for doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Right, right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">(Pause): [00:09:43 00:09:50]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Although maybe you're also saying that that's all there on the surface, that that's what's driving how you respond to it, that there still may be also some voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. The ten-I mean, the tension, see I was feeling pretty good up until I heard about it and now I have the tension headache back a little bit, I feel a little off. So, yeah, it's like this is mostly good on the surface but I feel really jittery on the inside. But again like you said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">who wouldn't in a way. I mean you're doing poetry readings, there's all this shit going on. I'm doing another reading next Friday. Like there's a lot going on, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(Pause): [00:10:30 00:11:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Maybe the other thing, too, is like a part of it is like, \u2018damn, so even though I'm feeling so great and I'm doing all this stuff, when am I just going to feel less,' you know what I mean? Like (inaudible) (Laughs) if that's what it is. Part of me is like, \u2018damn it, I'm doing so much better <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">and I am doing all this stuff so why are, you know, shouldn't I be a little more, I don't know. Or, I'm just over thinking it and I am being (inaudible). Does that sound like I'm having a panic, you know, I had a little bit of an anxiety attack yesterday, but it was very, very mild and passing. So, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F2\">I don't know if I'm just used to over thinking, like why am I this, why am I, you know what I mean? Why am I jittery? Why am I, you know-that's not good either. You can't over, I mean obviously there are a lot of deeper things that we talk about but I'm just saying it's probably not good all day with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F3\">every little thing. I'm like, \u2018why can't I be more calm?' I am calm. (Laughs) That's one of the things that anybody that knows me knows, like, \u2018gee, you're always so calm.' <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: (Chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: And yet, I'm constantly badgering myself wondering why...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">(Pause): [00:12:18 00:12:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I mean I guess maybe that's what it is. That's what it really, it is, like my mother's, all this bullshit, it's so deep, maybe that's just hard to battle that I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">(Pause): [00:12:49 00:12:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What you're talking about is being aware of the running stream of self-criticism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah, like instead of just chilling out and being like, \u2018oh that sucks, whatever,' or being like you said just legitimately kind of annoyed or even a little bit jittery, or whatever, but not then being so aware of it and like constantly monitoring it because that becomes like hyper-vigilance <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">or whatever.

So, I just, I'm not saying I should be skipping down <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">the street but this is really the happiest I've ever been and that's a big fucking deal. So, that must be my mom's side, it's just like never, it's never enough or it's never (clears throat).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but something's kicked up about it, maybe some, it hadn't been quite feeling like this and now in the last week or so it sounds like the anxiety feels stronger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe, also, maybe that reading triggered something. You know, it was a big deal. It was my uncle's 50th anniversary of his death, maybe there's been stuff kind of-when I went to the church and got emotional and stuff. I don't know. The Kelly thing.

This is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200892\">more like we're two adults and she's, I mean she is amazing. I really care about her but I'm also slightly, I mean it think it's kind of legitimate to whether you're dating someone to think about things and think about, is this the right person? Or, I mean, they have a kid or if they're not Assyrian. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200893\">They're not, you don't want to use those excuses to sabotage stuff, but I think, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And maybe that's the question is how much of what's going on around that is something like it's going to well, so you're going to pull back, or how much of it is just feeling like more genuine confident feeling out (cross talk) (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: I think most of it is kind of more confident, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">(Pause): [00:17:19 00:17:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098520\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">CLIENT: Or if nothing else, I feel like it's a healthy mix, at least I'm aware that it might be sabotage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: I just feel like, you know, I'm not going to be, like remember I was telling you that Assyrian chick who was at the reading. Like now all of a sudden she wants to hang out. So, I thought about it and was like, \u2018you know what, yeah, I do want to hang out with her.' Like, it's kind of not a big <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">deal. We're going to go have drinks and I'm not going to think about it one way or the other really. That is something that's always kind of bothered me that I haven't kind of been able to date someone Assyrian-at least see what it's like in my more evolved life. I don't know, but.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">(Pause): [00:18:26 00:18:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Does it worry you doing that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: It doesn't worry me. I think this is all, again, it's all new. It's very adult. I think this is the way dating works, actually. People date and they, until they really decide to make a very serious commitment. It's not like they're looking, but I think if there's something legitimate like in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">this case, I think it's an unusual thing, I mean it's not, she's not any girl. She's the only Assyrian girl I've really had a thing for.

Because with that I'd know that that's what, you know, I'm going to hook up with them and it might be nice for a week or something and they're just a girl like any other girl, or, it's just another situation. So, I'm careful <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">about that, but ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">(Pause): [00:19:51 00:20:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: You know what's funny? Some of this could also be, and I'm not deflecting the other important stuff, but I'm realizing that some of this could also be like when you have this much on your plate it's even more important to have a better sleep schedule, do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Um hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: But yeah, of course if you don't feel like you're really awake until like noon then you kind of feel like, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Because if you're up and feeling kind of bright eyed and bushy tailed at like 8 or 9 and you've got the whole day to kind of slowly chip away at things and then it's only 4. But if you're not getting your (laughs) minimum, you're kind of like, business hours, certain things you've got to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">by 5 or whatever so you're just kind of asking to be jittery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: Because you're listless.

No, I know, I know. You're right, you're right. Dave and I talk about that. We go back and forth because we both feel bad about working for the same edge, we both, but we're like (laughs) it's like we are who we are, we kind of like that about us. That we're not these fuddy-duddy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">like, \u2018oh, I'm fucked the whole week if I buy this glass of wine.

And then I just kind of get back on the horse. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">that's just your schedule that starts kind of, you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">(Pause): [00:22:25 00:22:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's what I mean.

I gotta find a way to maybe, maybe it does come down to like I just need to take something and really just, like take something like at midnight...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: ...so that at 1:30 I'm just knocked out. I don't want to do that but I think that that's what might have to happen and that other, that melatonin, I mean it doesn't work sometimes, so I don't know if I have to talk to my doctor or just take something over-the-counter, but you can't take that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">stuff every day, right? The over-the-counter stuff, you're not supposed to, I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: You can get dependent on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Psychologically, I mean, physically. Not psychologically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: I'll just talk to the pharmacist or something.

Like, I'll have one or two and then I'll have a medium Dunkin at practice which in my mind is better than drinking beer while we play and then going to a bar. But, and also like for example at Starbucks-I mean it's half hot water, half coffee. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">mean it's, I don't know how strong that is, but and a lot of times I'll throw it away. You know, it's just, I'm very like slow. I sip, I sip, I don't care if it's hot or cold but then it gets like, but then I toss it. I would say really like a whole all day, like it's really only an actual cup, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD2\">a little bit more. I don't think that's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: No, that's not bad at all. Any caffeine past about 4 o'clock though for some people will really keep them awake, even a quarter of a cup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Not all people. Some people can go right to bed. Some people are very sensitive to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: I think when I'm otherwise not feeling like overloaded it's always been fine. I've had cups of coffee like at midnight and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: So it may be nothing but it may also be when you're in a kind of anxious mood that it exacerbates it a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: Exactly, no I thought about that yesterday, it was like, \u2018I probably shouldn't get this coffee, but,' it's just habit. It's kind of cold and we practice in a warehouse and it's kind of comfy and for my throat, I don't know. But I could drink tea or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">(Pause): [00:25:13 00:25:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah, because it probably it's also, well not probably-it is, that I think it ends up making me feel depressed, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Oh, for sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: I mean like you know you got to think there is something biologically-you've just got to be up and about by like at least 9, 9:30, you know. On the weekends it could be later or whatever. Sundays you can sleep in. You gotta be, just even if you're just up and about in your pajamas, just doing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">get on the laptop, whatever, make some breakfast, whatever it is. I think I've just been resisting, well one, I just feel overloaded so there's that quiet time at night when I just feel kind of, but also, I don't want to take anything, but, you've got to do what you've got to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098520\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: There have been times when you've slept, gone to bed earlier, those were a few sort of phases, no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: But those are so few and far between, it never becomes a pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Because you've come in here saying I'm going to bed earlier. Is it more like a week, you'll get a week doing that and then it falls off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: And even that week it'll be like most of the days but not every day. (Pause) Or sometimes weird things happen, like I'll sleep late but still wake up like at 9 and for whatever reason I'll feel pretty good and I'll get up. But when I'm feeling like this it's definitely, you know, when I'm asleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F91\">I'm crashed. I just feel tired and you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">(Pause): [00:27:07 00:27:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you're body's going to be exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">(Pause): [00:27:14 00:27:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">THERAPIST: There almost feels like there's something missing inside about just kind of about the internalization of good self-care. You know we try to weave it around finances or what was missing about guidance, you know, I don't know how much what you think of what bedtimes were or taking (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201011\">for protecting your sleep.

Because I was a good kid, so what did I want. I mean I didn't want to always be out or you know.

And I just wonder about, when you're by yourself with whatever's in your mind, is it just too, it's not settleable (sp?) on your own a lot of the time. You could even say you have to have the company of the TV or ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: ...like almost if you stay up until you don't even, yet all you do is pass from awake to asleep because you're so tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's just what happens.

It's not just self criticism. Self criticism sort of sounds like it's like a shallow level of describing it. You're thinking about, not just processing about your mother's destructiveness when she would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">envy something in you (inaudible) and in terms of destruction.

That's not a kind of just holding, loving...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">CLIENT: And like kind of calming...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Yes<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">CLIENT: ...like restorative kind of love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yes.

Those kinds of things. Why? You know, because it's like walking into my mom's apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201732\">trying to be happy to see her and the first thing is like, you know, something negative or she just looks like all fucking negative and deflated.
