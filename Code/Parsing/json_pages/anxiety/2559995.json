Yeah, it's stupid though. It's fucking stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What's that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Well, it's not like I didn't get all the information I learned in college, you know, because I skipped a math class at the end.

I mean, that'd be fun (inaudible 01:36) the acting element of it, you know. But I got for stage, not film, so I would have to do that instead.

Is it because everybody wants to if it's too close to Chicago -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Because everyone else is in Chicago, yeah. Everyone who's any good is in Chicago. And they're only there because you're going to make it in Chicago or you don't want to go to Chicago, you know. In Chicago, you're not getting the real practice with a real director and other real actors. You're <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">just kind of second-stringing it, you know. But voiceover would be interesting.

And it's this really fun, like, high intensity. Like, it [hits the bill] (ph) where you start out as a very sort of, like, \"Hey, you know, I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">just really excited to see you. It's cool. Like, aw, I'm so nervous because you're here\" sort of thing, to this slow revelation of a true psychosis, you know, underneath this fan, you know, and his (ph) real delusional state.

Yeah, it's written to be a monologue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (inaudible 04:11) I suppose I could still do that. Yeah, that was a fun one. Yeah (inaudible 04:19) I took this acting class from this woman who worked with Willem Dafoe (inaudible 4:25). I took this acting class from Willem Dafoe [or from] (ph) this woman who worked with Willem Dafoe. And she's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">always talking about, like, you know, your breathing. (Laughter) And, like, honesty and breathing. And, you know, I was watching you, man. You breathe so honestly, you know. And this is (inaudible 4:46) [it was weird] (ph), you know. Just (inaudible 04:51). And I could work back into it, I'm sure. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">could fall back into how that stuff works. (inaudible 04:57), you know. (inaudible 04:58) to every moment, you know. Which reality should I believe in today? All right, great. Boom, that's the one that I'm doing, you know. At the same time, I don't know how I would do with, like, going on stage again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Or a tryout.

I'm very good at cold reading. So it always me a huge advantage, you know, over people, is that I could pick up a script and sound like I've been reading the script for because my reading comprehension is very strong, and I could just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">(inaudible 5:35) about. Read through it right fast (crosstalk 05:37) while I was waiting to go on stage. And then, you know, just go. Or they don't give you the script, and you're sitting on a (inaudible 05:46). You're just watching other people go, and you learn the scene as they're doing it. Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B2\">no, you should have gone down there instead of up. And I'm like, \"Yep, no. he pushed it too far though, so I need some more strength,\" you know. But then you get up there, you're like, \"[Now I'll do it] (ph). Boom.\" And they're like, \"Oh, my god. (inaudible 06:04) you look like two different people.\" <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B3\">Yes, people look different. They think and feel different things. So, yeah, but the one I did, the one that was really good was Josh from Uncle Bob. I can't do (ph) Josh anymore. He's a young man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What's Uncle Bob?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: It's this really interesting (inaudible 06:24) play. It's Uncle Bob, who has finally come to term with his sexuality late in life. So he's been married to this woman for years. And he can't bring himself to leave her, so he starts having sex with guys in, like, public bathrooms until he gets <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">AIDS. Like, with the intention of getting AIDS. And then he gets AIDS. And he's like, \"I have AIDS.\" And so she leaves. Then his nephew, his rich nephew, you know, comes to stay with him. He's like, \"What the fuck, man?\" And he's rich. Rich, like, disaffected, rebellious nephew. Like, crashes Porsches <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F2\">for fun and that gets a new one or whatever, you know. And it was really (inaudible 07:12) always looked up to this uncle. The nephew's also, like, really define (ph) himself (inaudible 07:15) sexuality. So he's really conflicted about his uncle's new sexuality (inaudible 07:22) with the whole AIDS <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F3\">thing, about death. And he has this huge, self-destructive streak himself.

Yeah, it's a really good monologue too. It's really good. (inaudible 07:42) Yeah. That'd be a blast to do that again. (inaudible 07:51) handle it.

And I had the talent to make it, certainly. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">just a matter of luck, at that point. Some subset (ph) have the talent, and then subset of that group have luck. And some subset of the group without talent also have luck, and [they get in] (ph), you know.
