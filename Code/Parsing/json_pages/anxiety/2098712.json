Yeah, I don't know, just do nothing and I kind of feel like this lethargicness (ph).

(PAUSE) Like I feel like I go through kind of though <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200871\">like (inaudible) having to be busy at work.

I don't really procrastinate much but like... And then I'll just, I'll, I guess like ramp up and do a ton of studying or, I don't know.

I get that, at another level, you're just going to be mad at yourself if you don't do anything. But I'm not sure if you wholeheartedly agree that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">should be mad at yourself if you don't do anything or whether that's what's going to happen even if there's another part of you that thinks that's okay and that you should just take a break. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think like how it feels is like you know like, like an example would be like you ate chocolate cake in the morning and so you're just like, \"Oh my day's ruined,\" and you're just like, \"I'm just going to eat whatever.\" That's the mindset I'm in when I'm home. Like, I'm just like, \"Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">like, it's not like it's okay to relax for a little bit.\" I'm just kind of like, \"I'm just going to (inaudible) just kind of like throw my hands up.

I mean, it's very like, I don't know, back and forth I guess with like, \"Whatever. It's okay that you're doing nothing.\" I'm kind of like antsy later about I need to do something. I don't know. Not good with the feeling of, yeah, like the day is lost or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: I see.

I just definitely feel like at the end of the day like, I don't know, it's weird mindset of just kind of like sleeping through the day, or not actually sleeping but kind of doing like, just like waiting for the next day to get over with, I don't know, instead of enjoying <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A71\">myself. I don't know. I kind of just... I mean, just being okay with doing very little or something or... (PAUSE) I don't know if it's... Yeah, like I don't think I have any expectations like, like I'm going to do all these things but I think the general feeling is when I go home it's just like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A72\">feeling like, yeah, I don't do anything or like I'm not enjoying myself and I just want to get back to here where I can do things or work. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098712\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Is it, is it a bit as though some part of you were kind of dead set against your happiness? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: That's...

It does seem there's a quality in the way you talk about things as though it's hard to feel at ease and kind of at ease or satisfied or contented <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">with sort of how things are or what's going on whether (inaudible) here or there or this or that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: I think I just want to feel productive and busy and, I don't know. I feel like anxious that... I don't know. I guess I'm like not using the time right or I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I see. You don't have much patience with being able to take it easy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: ...and feel like you should always being doing something constructive or productive or getting something done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Whether it's exercising or work or med school or future stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Right. And yeah, I just am worried that I'll get in like, yeah, mindset where I don't do very much and yeah, I feel like I'm just waiting out the days or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">But, yeah, I don't know. Like with home I don't know how to like, I guess, enjoy myself. I think I sort of... I mean, I am excited to go home but I think it's because this time people are going to be there and I guess it's more distractions but, yeah. Yeah. I guess I just enjoy feeling productive instead <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C71\">enjoying whatever something else or what I'm doing, not doing anything or simple things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: And do you think that's kind of generally true for you or do you think that's tied now to this, you know, big issue of figuring out what you want to do like career wise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: I think it's a general thing. I think like, like, like everyday I kind of like check in with like, \"Oh, what have I done today?\" Like I guess is (inaudible) I did data analysis or I did so many, you know, extractions or something,\" like a kind of checking in to see what I've done and, I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">know. I think thinking like that makes me feel better about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: You say like where's the productivity here? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So... (PAUSE) Yeah, I think I've always kind of been that way. But I don't know if it's like extra important for me now because it's like as long as I'm doing something... Like it's okay when I'm productive so I don't have to look into med school or kind of feel better about myself, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D31\">I don't know (inaudible at 00:22:57). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: And like to what extent? In what ways do you take it out on yourself if you aren't doing enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: I don't know. I'm just critical or... I don't know. I think, yeah, it's kind of that feeling of, yeah, like giving up or the day is wasted or, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098712\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: What's that feeling like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don't know. I'm trying to think. (PAUSE) I think a lot like when I do think that way I kind of think about, I guess all the things I could do to rectify what happened today or like to make myself feel better I think a lot about that. Maybe I, I don't know, am critical when I don't have things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">to do or like what got me in this rut in the first place. Did I sleep too long or, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I think it's definitely the way you're talking is it seems to me that you convey a fair amount of sort of pain and hurt describing what it's like when you haven't been productive and when you're kind of calling yourself out on not having done enough that... I mean, it sort of indirectly seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">to me that like you kind of do a number on yourself when that happens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">But you don't sort of come out and say that. Like you said, \"Well, you know I try to think of (inaudible at 00:26:19) or what happened or how that came about (inaudible). I believe you. Those are the thoughts that you have (inaudible). But your affect comes across like you're, like it's upsetting and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E31\">it's painful. And I was sort of but that's not quite what you're explicitly saying about what it's like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Right. I guess like, yeah, during those times it feels like I'm my lowest or, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Is it hard to talk about how bad it feels? I guess... Let me rephrase that. I think it's hard to talk about how bad it feels. (LAUGHTER) I'm not trying to twist your arm and get you to talk about it but it seems to me like that's true. That's sort of interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: I think yeah it is hard. Right now it's kind of... I'm not remembering it very well. I think I just kind of remember it like thinking my... During this time I analyze (inaudible) my relationships with people and I don't know (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: What do you think of your relationships with other people? Like happened in those?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Right. Like... I don't know. Like I think a lot about like... I don't know. Like I wish I was closer to this person or like I wish I... I don't know. I wonder how I come off to people or I wish like (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Are you aware of feeling sad now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah but I don't really know why. I think, I think it's just because I have the time and I don't know. I don't do like anything with it or... Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: You may be right. I have an alternative hypothesis...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: ...that's not altogether straying from that. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">I sort of wonder if it's hard to be aware. I think you probably like really do a number on yourself in the moments when this happens. Like after you've eaten the chocolate cake or after you've blown off, you know, the day in terms of being productive if you haven't worked out and you haven't, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD1\">gotten anything done vis-\u00e0-vis whatever you could have gotten done. Yeah like that... And you sort of get going on yourself and you get sort of critical and feel low. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">I wonder if you're sort of, kind of strange to say, but like not sort of all that fully aware of how you're feeling. I mean, you're aware of being very frustrated with yourself and clearly are. But I think you might also just be feeling really sad or like bad or kind of down for feeling like you've <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF1\">fucked up so badly as you see it in that moment. I mean, the frustration part I think you sort of identify more easily or readily. I imagine there's a kind of a sad part there that's a little harder to be as clear that you're feeling perhaps in those moments and that some of that is (inaudible) evidence <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF2\">now as we're talking about them. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098712\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: And I may be just misreading your affect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: No I think (inaudible) I think I'm just sad that things aren't the way I want them or... Yeah. The general, yeah, disappointment or sadness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: What thing? I mean, I have some thought. But I'm not sure which ones you're referring to. But what things aren't the way you want them? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: I don't know. I guess, yeah, I have this kind of feeling that like, you know, it's too late. Like I didn't turn out the way I wanted to or, I guess, friendships and (inaudible) critical of or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry; I'm probably being too (inaudible) like you kind of like there's something like that going on at large. Like you sort of want it in some major way. Like the way you could blow a day by nine or ten in the morning kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Like you kind of blown it career wise in some way by not already being underway or by not (inaudible) personality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's just kind of a lot of asking why and why am I this way? Whatever. And yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: So you're like sad that this is how things have turned out...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">THERAPIST: ...more so than because you feel you're blaming yourself for being such a fuck up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">CLIENT: Right (inaudible) regret I didn't do.

Like it sounds like there can be sort of a fair amount riding on what you do today in terms of how you feel or think about some of these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: Right. Or I think it's (inaudible) work or like, you know, happen like (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">CLIENT: And then, I don't know (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">THERAPIST: I see. So the sort of, the fork in the road one way is towards, you know, pain every day (inaudible) there's a chance I can move forward and, you know, got to med school and the other way is kind of like, \"I didn't do anything today. This is how it's always going to be.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I think it's like when I saw my friend she's like very excited about things (inaudible) okay, maybe I can do this.\" But then, I don't know, the feeling goes away. Like (inaudible) I don't know like rationalize it or something. Like yeah. Yeah, the feeling of like my chances have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201271\">gone, you know. Yeah. (PAUSE) I think the whole like feeling productive is just like having a plan for beforehand or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">And I guess I also feel like I'm at a loss for like what I can do at home to not feel like I've wasted time there.
