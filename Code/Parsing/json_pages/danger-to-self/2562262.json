I\u2019m feeling a little better today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Good. I think I was a little slow getting back to you on Friday as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: No, that\u2019s okay. Actually, yeah, no, I was sort of doing pretty badly and like quite badly, and I was like, \u201cYou know, I should just call Chad,\u201d like I should just do that, and then we ended up watching some TV and then that like really helped. The thing that\u2019s been like probably the most weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">and confusing for me and not weak or through it felt like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">I feel like I\u2019m sort of splitting very efficiently into two completely different people. So, you know, I haven\u2019t really told anybody at church that I\u2019m having a hard time, and I am positive that nobody has any idea because like, you know, I went to this conference on Saturday and like it was great. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">And I was great and I talked to people and sort of pretended to be extroverted and that was wonderful. And then I came home and it was just immediately awful. Or immediately is probably an exaggeration. But like within a couple hours it was pretty awful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s like a reaction to that, or it sort of feels like, it feels like there\u2019s this big chunk of me right now that\u2019s sort of incoherent and out of control and just really unhappy and sort of raging. And I\u2019m trying to sort of mediate between that and other people and like things <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">are hard for me. But I say \u201cThings are hard for me,\u201d in this sort of tone, and so it\u2019s like that mediation is our doom because, does that make sense? But like by the fact that I\u2019m able to sort of talk about it in this calm tone, I feel like it\u2019s hard to me to\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Represent that part at all, really. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what seems more like descriptive or expressive of that other side is like how much suicidal thinking you\u2019re having and the cutting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">And, you know, I sometimes fear, and I\u2019m sure say, \u201cOh my God,\u201d when you\u2019re really feeling intensely because you\u2019re (inaudible at ). It does seem like the more direct expression of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, it seems like I called you last night and I like I\u2019m scared, and I felt like it might have come across that I was scared in a general sense, but I was like scared about last night, like about what are the next two hours going to be like for me, like am I going to make it through three hours? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And I don\u2019t, yeah, I don\u2019t really know at this point if, I don\u2019t know how to communicate that, like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Yeah, it\u2019s just like, you know, talking with you last week and last night and also sort of talking with Dr. Jannis (sp) today, so like I can, like both of you sort of suggested some, like interpretive models for what\u2019s going on here and why, like I\u2019m so suicidal right now. And they make sense, and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">sort of believe them. But it also feels like it\u2019s not, it doesn\u2019t feel like it addresses the things that, the really scary part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">Like yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But that certainly is how it seems to me as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">Like when you said last night that you felt like you\u2019ve got the tiger by the tail, it\u2019s pretty clear who\u2019s talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562262\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: So no, I, that makes sense to me. Yeah, I\u2019m not yet clear how to understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Like how the other part communicates. I mean, (inaudible at ). I mean, there are, yeah, I\u2019m not sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: James seems relatively unfreaked by this. That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean, he\u2019s scared, but I think my sort of, my worry is that I\u2019ll recapitulate all this sort of traumatic parts of the last couple of years for him in this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">That doesn\u2019t really seem to be happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What was Curtis\u2019 (sp) idea that was going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: He seemed to sort of think that it was a largely coming from like being, feeling more secure and more hopeful about the future, done like as things start to stabilize and get better that I\u2019m reacting against that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Is that different from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Pretty much. Well I sort of suggested, I suggested that it\u2019s one of a couple things that might be going on, and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">I mean, not really, but like he was pretty, he seemed pretty certain. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really not that remarkable that we would agree (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">Yeah, today has been. Talking this morning was frustrating for me, but I felt like I, it was really important for me to talk about like, I sort of, I talk to you about like the suicidality. I want to talk about like how that\u2019s affecting me and James, like I want to talk about how I take care of him <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">in this, and I felt like we didn\u2019t really get to talk about that much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">And so it was frustrating, but I\u2019m not very good at sort of, I\u2019m not very good yet with him at like staying in the moment, like I don\u2019t think this is working right now, can we talk about something, you know, can we like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Table it for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then I feel sort of like, I don\u2019t feel very good about like then after the fact, telling you that, because that\u2019s not really addressing the problem, but I do feel like that it helps me like go back the next week and say, \u201cI do want to do this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: That\u2019s just <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">I\u2019ve been sleeping a lot. I just get really tired. I feel like the last several days have mostly consisted of me like deciding once every five to ten minutes, the entire time I\u2019m awake that no, I\u2019m not going to kill myself today, and it\u2019s tiring, as it turned out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m not feeling it right now, so I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t, but I also think this is the thing that is going on for me, and so I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I think, what you can get into I think, because you\u2019re talking today, is the difficulty of like communicating these sorts of things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">I mean, striking away when you say that last night you didn\u2019t know how to make clear that when you said you were afraid, you were afraid of making it through those few hours, it was two hours, I think you said. And I guess in my mind that you were, or that you were afraid you weren\u2019t going to be able <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">to kill yourself and carrying out a plan to kill yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">And I just imagine that like you\u2019re very worried about saying that explicitly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I seem to be, because I don\u2019t say it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: And your feeling is, I don\u2019t know, what you said earlier today was, you know, you don\u2019t know how to say it, but feeling it and not knowing how to say it. But what it looks more like, from a little on the outside, is that you don\u2019t want to, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562262\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">Or you\u2019re frightened to say it. Maybe there is another reason that you don\u2019t want to say that you\u2019re frightened, I\u2019m not sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like in some ways. This is maybe something sort of related, but think, in terms of not telling friends and family that I\u2019m having a hard time. I feel like it\u2019s, I feel better about being isolated if I\u2019m sort of isolating myself than if I\u2019m telling people about it and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">I\u2019m still isolated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Like the thing I am, the thing that seems really devastating to me is to tell people about it. Maybe nothing they can do, or nothing they care to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">You know, James asked me last night, like if there\u2019s anything I can do. I tried to come up with something because it makes me feel better when I can do something. And so I sort of said, \u201cWell maybe you can sort of like tell family about it,\u201d but then I was like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t actually really want you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">to.\u201d But I don\u2019t know. There is really something weird about talking about it right now that I don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: But it\u2019s sort of looming large for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at ). I think, I think that on the one hand you are really worried. You know, I think when you, depending on how open you are, how direct, you really put yourself in someone hands and tell them how you\u2019re doing. You know, last hour you said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing very well,\u201d moreso than <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">your saying, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to deal with (inaudible at ) in the next hour, same or different state. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: And the second one says, (inaudible at ) I think. I think you\u2019re putting it in its own hands and I think there\u2019s in some sense, like the real worry that the other person won\u2019t, I guess he won\u2019t respond helpfully or there won\u2019t be anything they can do as you said. But I think there\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">else too which is like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">(pause) (inaudible at ), but someone like I think to some extent you feel like the other person being sort of open to what you have to say, listening, taking it in, you know, being sort of pretty clearly supportive about it feels like doing something, and (inaudible at ), which I think you\u2019re probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">doesn\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And maybe that\u2019s where some of the complexity is, that it\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s going to feel like the other person can do something about it or not. I think last night on the phone it probably did feel like I did something, or was there, you know, like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Actually, it felt pretty bad, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s about the same. No, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re letting me know. I had to say it, only because you mentioned you were better today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, but yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Either that, whatever, you said after you got off the phone last night. Yeah, I think it feels like telling people about it sort of puts myself in their hands, both in terms of like that, in that moment, like will they be able to help? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">In that moment, will they respond in a way that\u2019s not totally appropriate, but then also like I don\u2019t know. I feel like it sort of leaves me vulnerable down the road. Yeah, I mean, I sort of keep going back to telling the clergy at my church and asking for, you know, support in some way and in general <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">they\u2019re good at offering support in the moment but then like it\u2019s just gone. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562262\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">Like they don\u2019t follow up, and that\u2019s sort of like long-term pretty devastating. And so, which I mean, it\u2019s hopeful that I\u2019m thinking about the long-term consequences of it, but\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: But I think of you always, always being worried about sort of driving people away like that. I guess it feels like it\u2019s often not just about driving them away in that moment, but like (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. My conversation with (inaudible at ) this morning sort of boiled down to him saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Just, he didn\u2019t actually say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d but just said that\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Meaning \u201cDon\u2019t worry about how I react to how you\u2019re feeling now?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like don\u2019t worry that I\u2019ll feel abandoned, or rather he\u2019s saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry that I\u2019ll feel abandoned.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">Which, shockingly enough, does not help me not worry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it also makes you mad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. I guess I sort of felt like I have a lot to carry right now, can I not carry you? And he said, he\u2019s tried to say yes, don\u2019t worry about carrying me, but in the way that makes it, that he\u2019s saying like, \u201cNo, you still have to keep worrying about me.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">(Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">(Long pause continues) I know what he said about, he said he really doesn\u2019t want the rest of our life to be a repeat of where we are now in the last two years, but that\u2019s not something to worry about right now, which that goes for me. Like the thing that I think about, or when I think about suicide, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">you know, I can see like making through, like I can always see making it through the next twenty minutes, and sometimes through the next hour, sometimes through the next two hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">But then when I think about like a week or a year or like it\u2019s when you stretch out the time that I can\u2019t see it. I just feel like \u201cWell yeah, I also don\u2019t want our lives to be like this for the rest of our lives.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Maybe that is a way in which no one is really there for you. Like with the possibility that this could go on like this for years and years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. It can then confuse me and like can sometimes people get through. It\u2019s hard to believe. And like I know that it\u2019s not always something that people go through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Do you mean sometimes with it for a long time and then sometimes (inaudible at ) before that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I mean, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">Like both, sometimes they live with it for a long time and yeah. (inaudible at ). Yeah, so when I talk about it with James, I talk about it as though like it is something that one day I will be (inaudible at ). Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">And how much I believe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: So he is kind of abandoning you there that, when he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to live with this the rest of our lives, but now is not the time,\u201d when you think about it that way. And it sounds like that is part of how you\u2019re thinking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And there\u2019s sort of this, it\u2019s like this sort of side of me that is very hopeful and optimistic and is doing things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562262\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">Like I\u2019m starting to make plans, starting to think about five years ahead, I\u2019m starting to think about ten years ahead. And that, but then it\u2019s like the way that I can get through the day with the other side of me is just to not think about further than a day ahead or a week ahead, and so yeah. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">not sure what\u2019s going on. And a lot of the time like I deal with it by like talking about the future, but with the sort of unexpressed caveat that we all that\u2019s not really going to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">So like I could make all kinds of plans because there will be no five years from now, so I can do whatever I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just a pretend future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">(Long pause continues) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">(Long pause continues) I find that going to church really helps. I\u2019ve been going a lot. That\u2019s like a half an hour or an hour where I think this is okay right now, this is okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">Talking to people afterward, (inaudible at ), but, or it\u2019s like, you know, social things.

And more or less a form like talking to the other person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
