So Selena\u2019s (ph) preschool is at like, Burnley boys and girls go to this pool and everything. And so the preschool for a month is having a swimming day with the kids, which is a nice idea except each kid has to have a parent or an adult to come take them to it. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">so that means that all these kids\u2019 parents have to decide whether to take off work to do this. Selena loves swimming. It\u2019s her thing. [1:14] So Kim (ph) asked me if I would do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">So then I was in the position of having to tell Kim that I don\u2019t really want to show all my scars to all of the moms of Burnley and their kids. It\u2019s not the best situation for that. So I did tell her why I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing it. She was fine with that, but it was not a good situation all around. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">Of course, she did \u2013 she\u2019s been like, switching off with a friend of hers. She takes Christian (ph) and Jack\u2019s child one week and then the friend\u2019s mom, you know, her friend takes them the next week. [2:16] I\u2019m really dreading this. Zara and I go and stay with them and hang out next to the pool with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">them so that I can help Christian get ready afterwards so that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So the moms can go sooner. (pause) What is it that\u2019s really bad about like -?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Not being there. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m there and I sort of feel like, why am I not the one going in the pool with Christian r. I feel like everyone is thinking that. [3:33] It would be a problem anyway, \u2018cause like, Sharon wouldn\u2019t be allowed to come with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So you\u2019d have to be someplace with Sharon. That\u2019s true. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Last week Sharon did okay. I didn\u2019t have that high hopes of her staying at one place with not very much to do for an hour and half, or I guess it was just an hour. But she did okay. [4:46] I brought distractions this week since I actually remembered. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: One other thing I don\u2019t get. Why do you have to be there the whole time instead of just at the end at the handoff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: They\u2019re actually not giving a good reason for that, other than that. There\u2019s not really anywhere fun to hang out. But yeah, Sharon was like \u2013 there\u2019s a bench with some kids books and I might steer towards it to play. [5:56] It\u2019s a good question. (pause) So I dreamed last night that \u2013 I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">know what it was, but like, somebody was talking to me. Some random person at a party was talking to me about a job that I had held some time ago and said that like, I got fired from that job, because they thought I was stealing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I was trying to explain that I wasn\u2019t stealing. And also, that that was pretty ridiculous, and fuck them. [7:04] It was weird. So I did actually have this happen to me once. The coffee shop where I worked in college, I would \u2013 it was my job to close-up. I had worked on Friday and Saturday nights for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">two years. So, you know, that should tell you something about my college experience. Actually, I really like those shifts. I closed up one day, and I came back the next morning, and they had been robbed. And you know, I put the key in the mail slot like, right there. And all the employees knew that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">So it wasn\u2019t like there was any reason for any suspicion around me. And in point of fact, the owner never said anything that suggested that he was suspicious that it was me. But the manager, who was an older student, said something like, well we know you\u2019re not hurting for money at some point like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">a week or so later. [8:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562454\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">That wasn\u2019t exactly what he said, but something to the effect of like, you don\u2019t have to worry, you have lots of money now. And I was just like, that\u2019s pretty awful. Surprisingly so. He was sort of like a jackass. I\u2019m not in any way surprised that he would say that. He\u2019s also like, very, very loyal <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">to that coffee shop. But yeah, not very nice. And like, not a \u2013 (pause) [9:29] In my dream I was working, and it was someplace I was working in Littleton, which is a town right next to the town where I grew up, which I remember, because I remember saying to someone, to the person who was accusing me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">like, well, if everybody in Littleton thinks I\u2019m a thief, that\u2019s not much of a loss for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">It\u2019s a pretty small town, when you come right down to it, which is what I was probably thinking of. Because the woman who was my boss at St. Margaret\u2019s, the dean of students, was just hired to be the head of Great Oaks, which is the all-girls school in Littleton which is like, I\u2019m just going to go ahead <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">and say it. It\u2019s a pretty horrible institution. [10:38] I think \u2013 I\u2019m sure there are lots of good things about it. There\u2019s always lots of good things. But basically, all of the most horrible girls that I went to school with ended up going to school there. And just like, talking with girls in the years <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">that I was in high school, it seemed like there was a lot of pretty crazy bullying. Jenny Leary\u2019s (ph) going to be in charge now. She\u2019s really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">She was a really good boss. I have a lot of respect for her. [11:36] I\u2019m pretty sure that this is what she wants, to be the head of school. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s not like \u2013 like, I could tell that that\u2019s what she wanted. Like, she started out as an English teacher. She was teaching English when I was in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">high school and got to be dean and was sort of moving up in that way into administration. And like, I could sort of see that, that\u2019s where she wanted to go. And it\u2019s not really an ambition I understand. But somebody\u2019s got to do it. [12:30] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">So she\u2019s been posting on Facebook they\u2019re selling their house and moving to Littleton. My mom used to live right by the school. When I was ten or eleven, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a very pretty spot. [13:20] It\u2019s a really beautiful town in a really pretty part of a beautiful town except for the people. Especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">when nobody\u2019s there. [13:43] You\u2019ve seen the West Wing, right? I don\u2019t know if I talked about this before. But the scenes that are set in Jed Bartlett\u2019s New Hampshire hometown, those are in Littleton.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: About Littleton. (pause) I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something about hanging out at the pool that feels a little like delaying. [14:50] And the sort of prospect of at the moms in Burnley seeing your scars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I already feel weird around therm. I feel weird around the parents, and I feel weird around the other nannies. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel weird around Kim and Frank, but like, I don\u2019t \u2013 And you know, I feel bad because everybody feels like they\u2019re being bullied in this situation, let\u2019s be honest, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">except for the kids. Nobody wants to like, wear a bathing suit when you\u2019ve got a preschooler. So you\u2019re not feeling good about your body anyway in March in this like, dreary YMCA pool while you take off work [16:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562454\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">Nobody wants to do it. (pause) Kim surely didn\u2019t want to do it. So that there was this hard thing of, part of me wants to say like, you just go to work and don\u2019t worry about it. I will do this, but I really don\u2019t want to have to be okay with the fact that I\u2019m not comfortable with that. (pause) [17:20] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">This is going to be about class a lot. I mean, just sort of like, on and off, having this job. It\u2019s really interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: I think maybe there\u2019s something different. Like, I imagine Kim and the other parents who are there may feel annoyed or hassled or frustrated that the preschool is doing this. But I bet they don\u2019t feel bullied. And like, when you\u2019ve got a kid in preschool it\u2019s kind of the thing you do. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">a lot of things like that at most preschools and elsewhere in your life if you have a three-year-old. [18:29] So like, tired, resentful, frustrated. Sure. Bullying? I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">And the reason I\u2019m mentioning it is \u2018cause it reminds me a little of something that came up yesterday in that I guess it kind of seems to me, maybe you are making this situation in that way. Like, sort of intractable where everybody\u2019s feeling equally awful. Because that doesn\u2019t leave you with much room <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">to feel bad yourself. [19:33] Kim\u2019s kind of got it just as bad. Maybe in a way, I may have it a little worse, because she\u2019s the one actually getting in the pool. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: That\u2019s totally something I\u2019d do. [20:36] (pause) I don\u2019t k now what to say about that. [20:21] (pause) [22:29] Littleton is fine, \u2018cause like, theoretically yes, it was just the kids. But it definitely feels like everyone in that town had it in for me. [23:21] (pause) [24:22] I think what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">most pissed off about in the situation is that like, I had to tell Kim about the scars anyway. Like, that was something I was not planning on sharing. And that I sort of got backed into a corner about. You know, I could have just said, I\u2019m not comfortable doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">You know, and I think she would have respected that. But I wanted her to know I had a fairly good reason for it. And the range of \u2013 I don\u2019t know. [25:34] I didn\u2019t want that. (pause) [26:54] I\u2019m just smiling, because I can definitely \u2013 I\u2019m sort of sitting here and I can feel myself like, projecting that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">onto you. Like, feeling like you are the one who\u2019s making me expose parts of myself that I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m like, whoa. So, that\u2019s happening. [27:26] (pause) [28:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Maybe you\u2019re mad about that, too. Not necessarily at me and the way it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re mad at Kim, necessarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Not like I look at it, and of course, it\u2019s not an unreasonable thing to ask. That makes sense. It\u2019s part of childcare. But like, I just, (inaudible at 29:01) [29:17] (pause) I think the thing with Jenny and the job in Littleton is that like, I\u2019m sort of in the same positioner where I either <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">have to \u2013 you know, I can like \u2013 she knows that I\u2019m from the area. So I like, congratulate here and jump on that train. Or I can say, actually I had really bad experiences from there and I think it\u2019s a terrible place and I don\u2019t think you should be there. [31:16] You know, and just in having to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">that choice, I feel like somehow it\u2019s wrong. (pause) It is a small town, but it doesn\u2019t mean it will leave me alone. [32:12] (pause) [33:23] I\u2019m just grumpy that I have to cut the session short in order that I not be late for this thing.
