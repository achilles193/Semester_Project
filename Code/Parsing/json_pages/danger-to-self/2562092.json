Yay! Yeah, I\u2019m really, really happy. Both of us cried, actually. But yeah\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s lovely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was really nice. It was actually right exactly where we thought it would be, in the giant pile of snow that the plow had pulled up. And today was the first [inaudible] that it was just sitting right on top of the snow. Yay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Oh good; that is great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah. I decided I\u2019m probably not going to wear it again until we get it resized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: What a relief. How long had it been lost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Almost a month, yeah. [1:01] It was like\u2026 it was pretty clearly not anywhere other than that parking space, but there was always snow and\u2026 or it was dark or it was\u2026 there was somebody parked there. So I feel like I would\u2019ve just kept going back until we left Denver. Which is good, because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">was having sort of a shitty day until then. That helped a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] Sherlock Holmes stories. The other day there was one in which there\u2019s a really important diplomatic [inaudible] stolen, and he wound up encouraging the [inaudible] who\u2026 the guy who lost it, the [inaudible] look in the box where he had originally stored it safely in his house\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And he had put it back there? [2:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: He got [inaudible] put it back there but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: No, I remember that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] I know it couldn\u2019t be anywhere else. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I like that one. I\u2019m also sort of glad that I found it instead of James finding it. I just feel better. (pause) I\u2019m getting [inaudible] I don\u2019t know what to say next [inaudible] at the end of that. I didn\u2019t think I was going to find it. [3:45] (pause) So I got these boots for Christmas. I basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">haven\u2019t taken them off because they\u2019re so comfortable. They\u2019re just really warm and they\u2019re comfortable and they don\u2019t leak and I love them. And so I wore them to church last night and hadn\u2019t checked the schedule beforehand and found out five minutes before the service that I was supposed to serve as <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">an altar person, so I definitely served [inaudible] last night in these boots and jeans. It was pretty good. I was like, I don\u2019t know, I just hate doing that sort of thing, forgetting things. [5:07] They usually send out an e-mail to everybody earlier in the week and I hadn\u2019t gotten one, and I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200273\">hadn\u2019t checked the calendar and I forgot. And it was fine but (pause) James\u2019s been looking for jobs. I feel like we get into this cycle where I\u2019m sort of shy or timid about asking him stuff about what he\u2019s working on because I don\u2019t want to bother him or put pressure on him, and then he feels like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200274\">just don\u2019t care. And I think one of the things that\u2026 I think he got\u2026 was sort of sad over break that no one in his family really asked about what his thesis was about, or the content of it. As he said, he was like well if I have the scientific knowledge of a senior in high school, most people are at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200275\">about a second grade level. So just\u2026 I think he\u2019s actually\u2026 he\u2019s very good at explaining it. I think it\u2019s just the kids\u2026 most people don\u2019t want to listen long enough to hear the sort of like basic science that he has to explain in order to get to the point where he can tell them about what he\u2019s doing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200276\">[7:05] And I feel like I have been included in that. Part of it is that I understand that when\u2026 I follow him when he\u2019s describing something or talking about something, but I have a hard time carrying it from one conversation to the next and so he ends up having to retell me about stuff, and that\u2019s frustrating. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200277\">And I am sort of timid about it. I sort of feel like he won\u2019t want to explain it to me. Or that if I ask about it he\u2019ll be impatient about telling me about the basic stuff, with the result that I think he feels like I just don\u2019t care about what he\u2019s doing. I wouldn\u2019t care about what he was doing if <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200278\">he weren\u2019t the person doing it. I don\u2019t\u2026 yeah, I don\u2019t have any inherent desire to know about chemistry, but if he\u2019s doing it I care very much about him. So I\u2019ve been sort of fretting about that. [8:26] I think I just need to be more decisive about asking what\u2019s going on day to day [inaudible] (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200279\">So apparently there aren\u2019t really any jobs in Texas unless he wants to make weapons, which he\u2019s not really a fan of. Apparently there\u2019s a job description that actually included make weapons in it. He\u2019s like that\u2019s\u2026 we\u2019re not supposed to be doing that. So probably not [inaudible] Somebody asked me if <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002710\">I wanted to be on the vestry at church last night, if I wanted to be nominated for it. The vestry\u2019s the people who make the decisions basically. It\u2019s an elected committee of the congregation who basically hire people and fire people and decide where the church is going. And do the budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562092\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Sort of like a board of directors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I said I would love to. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be living here in six months so maybe this isn\u2019t the year. [10:15] So then I turned into this thing of I don\u2019t want to talk to James about how his job search is going without grilling him on it because well yes, this\u2026 it\u2019s hard for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">me to live with this uncertainty but I feel like James\u2026 and I feel like James is very sensitive to that, but at the same time this is a really important decision for him. I think he should take his time. I think he should because if he is in a position where he can take his time and still get a paycheck, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">yeah, I think we should find something that he wants. And it makes me sad to try to talk about it. Yeah, I guess I feel like talking to him, there\u2019s just a lot of sadness to fight through for both of us. And [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I guess there\u2019s something about feelings that as you\u2019re talking and thinking about it here that gets also uncomfortable. [12:34]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s sort of like it\u2019s there, and I want to talk about it here because it\u2019s the sort of place that I have to be sad, but then that\u2019s hard and I don\u2019t want to. And I worry about whether it\u2019s okay and (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Feeling okay with me or with James?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: With you. (pause) Somehow I ended up in a conversation\u2026 I spent this morning with somebody who I don\u2019t know, and he\u2019s a friend of a friend. [14:11] He\u2019s like well, I just don\u2019t think therapy actually works. I haven\u2019t seen anybody that it\u2019s worked for. And I was just like okay, that\u2019s fine. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about so I\u2019m just going to let this go, but that\u2019s really hard for me. It\u2019s getting easier but (pause) I sort of get low and then I feel better and then I get low and then I feel better, and I feel like it\u2019s very important for me for there to be a signal in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">as opposed to just noise. But, yeah, I don\u2019t know.

[16:41] Or I\u2019m going to think you shouldn\u2019t be talking about feeling sad about things with James.

[19:02] Maybe it\u2019s not a very far step from well, I kind of want to be able to talk about x, y, or z, but I think it\u2019s going to cause trouble or it\u2019s not right or it\u2019s going to make me feel worse <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">at the end of it to well, it doesn\u2019t seem that there are things I\u2019m upset about, it\u2019s just that sometimes I\u2019m really upset and sometimes I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think [inaudible] (pause) So when I\u2019m thinking of that I don\u2019t quite know how I\u2019m getting there, what I\u2019m thinking is that I still cut myself but I feel like more than ever I\u2019m sort of divorced from any real understanding of why I\u2019m doing it or any\u2026 it\u2019s not necessarily triggered by <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">anything. Or if it is, it\u2019s not triggered by the same things that it used to be or things aren\u2019t as bad when I\u2019m cutting myself. [21:20] I don\u2019t know. But (pause) [inaudible] still seem to really need [inaudible] (pause) James hasn\u2019t really mentioned it.

[23:38]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I mean I guess [inaudible] don\u2019t want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah but I also really do\u2026 it\u2019s starting to sort of feel like I\u2019m really sad somewhere and that I sort of want to get it over with but [inaudible] feels really destructive and scary and, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And I think you probably heard my saying you don\u2019t want to talk about it as\u2026 I think you probably know I didn\u2019t mean it critically but I think it probably felt like you feel ashamed of not wanting to bring it up or as though you should be able to just kind of talk that out or bring it up. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">[25:23] Like there was a little bit of I put some pressure on you to do that and you feel bad about it.

(pause) I think one of the reasons that I continue to cut myself, it\u2019s a little bit of a fuck you to everybody else. [32:47] It\u2019s like I know that this is really bad but this is what I\u2019ve got. So that way they don\u2019t really [inaudible] So basically I\u2019m 16. [ph?] I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">not particularly proud of that but it\u2019s definitely there. It really doesn\u2019t go away.

I just hate it. [36:01] (pause) I\u2019m not sure why I clean my glasses with my shirt when the tissues are right there. (pause) I\u2019ve been pretty hard on myself recently. [38:25] It sort of feels like I\u2019m stuck in this pattern of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">I know the things I\u2019m doing that aren\u2019t helpful or that are bad for me or that are reinforcing things that hurt me, but I can\u2019t get out of it. (pause) So one of the things I\u2019ve been beating myself up about recently is not writing. [39:53] But I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019m already in one marathon. Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">I should give myself a break for not starting another one.
