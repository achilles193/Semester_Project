So Philip Seymour Hoffman died, as you know. Everybody is sort of talking about addiction and I\u2019m sort of thinking about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I\u2019m not sure what to make of it, but I find it interesting that for example, like I\u2019m pretty comfortable telling people that I don\u2019t know very well that like I have a history of depression, mental illness, but like I don\u2019t tell anybody that I (inaudible at ). And I\u2019m sort of, I think, sort of increasingly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">seeing that as addictive behavior like, in that like I don\u2019t stop, even though I want to. And you know, like I know it like hurts people for me to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">And that like, the sort of like triggers that set me off are much less than big than they used to be, so it takes a lot less. James and I kind of talked about it a few days ago when things were really bad. He started kind of blank. He\u2019s like I know that you\u2019re cutting yourself and I don\u2019t really know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">what to do about it, and it doesn\u2019t seem like you want to talk about it, and it doesn\u2019t seem like this any sort of cry for help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">It seems like you really don\u2019t want to talk about it, but so I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m supposed to acknowledge it or not or just ignore it, but I don\u2019t really want to ignore it, but I also don\u2019t want to make you talk about it, so I know this is happening. And that was that, which, you know, I was very <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">grateful for having brought that up. But I\u2019m sort of just like, \u201cYep.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">(Long pause) I don\u2019t know whether or when I\u2019ll be able to talk. I don\u2019t know when I will want to stop more than I don\u2019t want to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">That is what I thought about last night. (Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: One minute, one thing you\u2019re kind of saying about it is that it disturbs you, or makes you feel kind of anxious that you don\u2019t feel all that in control of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I feel like I don\u2019t really understand that well why I do it, and I sort of, and part of that is that I think that like the reasons change, or like it\u2019s not just one thing. A lot of days I will sort of say like, \u201cNo, I am not going to do this,\u201d and then I will do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Yeah. Despite the fact that like, especially like living with James, it\u2019s not easy to do. Like there\u2019s a real barrier there. Yeah. And I, right now I\u2019m not trying that hard to sort of push back against it. At least one of the reasons is that like I\u2019m afraid that if I do, then I\u2019m afraid that without <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">it, like things will sort of explode in more destructive ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">Like, I feel like I won\u2019t, that I won\u2019t be able to sort of manage my emotions in the way that this helps me and that that will yeah, cause me to like attempt suicide or, you know, destroy my relationships or just like at night. So yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">It\u2019s sort of something that I\u2019ve been saying, like, \u201cI\u2019ll deal with this later.\u201d (Long pause). But it just gets more firmly entrenched. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">From like the literature that they give you about it, like reading about it, I understand it. Like one of the problems with it is that it keeps you, it puts you in a position where you don\u2019t have to develop healthier coping mechanisms, and I feel like, I feel like I work pretty hard to develop healthy <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">coping mechanisms, but I don\u2019t feel like they work as well, which is sort of awful, but there it is. You know, they\u2019re like, \u201cGo like make yourself a nice cup of tea and take a hot bath to soothe yourself.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay.\u201d Sometimes that\u2019s helpful, but sometimes it\u2019s really not. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562266\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">Yeah. It sort of feels like all of the ways that I have for coping when things get overwhelming or bad are like none of them are enough. It\u2019s just that all of the things are all of the things I have until like I just sort of, you know, self-injury doesn\u2019t help that much, like it doesn\u2019t fix things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">It just helps more than if I don\u2019t do it, and so <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">(Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">I think it\u2019s also like there\u2019s like a, it feels like part of me is saying like, \u201cNo, you need to stop. Like you need to be ready to stop, even if you don\u2019t feel ready.\u201d Like and just sort of pushing me on that, but I feel like that\u2019s the same part of myself that pushes me to do things that are not healthy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">like the same, that says like, \u201cYou need to be better, not self-destructive.\u201d And so it\u2019s like I trust that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see, like that it can be a little neglectful of you in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It sort of sounds like you shouldn\u2019t take into consideration like personal costs to yourself or how you take care of yourself, you shouldn\u2019t take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: My take on it is, I may sound tentative again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">That cutting yourself is a form of things like feeling yourself being treated badly or hurtfully, and that at a time when you\u2019re sort of feelings are kind of out of control, maybe it\u2019s anxiety, maybe it\u2019s guilt, maybe it\u2019s sadness, maybe anger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">You know, when how you feel kind of out of control, sort of like treating yourself badly or hurtfully, I could imagine for you being kind of reassuring by contrast, for example, to like giving yourself space to feel whatever it is, or imagining somebody being there, being supportive or feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">you have a right to feel the way that you\u2019re feeling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">I would think those things are more alarming at the time by contrast to feeling like you\u2019re being treated really bad or in a hurtful way. (Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(Long pause continues) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: (Long pause continues) Yeah, I don\u2019t know what to say about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(Long pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t have a strong immediate sense of whether the way you\u2019re framing it is right or fits right, so yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">Like I don\u2019t have a strong sense of either direction. (Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">At least sometimes, and I think that it\u2019s probably related. It\u2019s like it is a relief to have something that is real that is wrong, or that feels real, that it feels like other people would think that it\u2019s real. I can\u2019t tell anybody about it, so the other people part of that isn\u2019t helpful. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: I guess one feature of the, really upset, like in the way that we\u2019re talking about it a feeling that can go along with that, at least in your head, that other people aren\u2019t going to see it as being real, what you\u2019re upset about.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562266\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m not sure what extent I see it as real, like or I see it as legitimate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">It\u2019s like there\u2019s this physical thing that hurts, and that\u2019s something to sort of hold on to and like everything else also hurts. Sort of like (inaudible at ). I think the thing that, I mean, one of the feelings that I\u2019m scared about is that like when I do push back against it and I didn\u2019t give in today, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">it feels like I\u2019m going to die. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Like it feels like yeah. It feels like I\u2019m drowning. You know, and I can sort of see that like cutting myself makes that feeling worse when I don\u2019t, like it makes it more of a meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Sorry, breathing\u2019s like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">Yeah, yeah. I am very ashamed to talk about this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Maybe I won\u2019t think that like the way that it helps is real, or even that you need to do it on your own? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I always sort of want to phrase it in my mind as like I don\u2019t have power over this and I can\u2019t make the choice not to, but like that\u2019s really bullshit, and I know it\u2019s bullshit, and I don\u2019t want to be buying into that. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m pretty ashamed of the fact that like I know I could choose <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">not to do this, and I do it anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess in a way (inaudible ) really, or ashamed around really wanted to. You know, it\u2019s still unclear whether or not this fits, but I guess part of my thinking in saying there\u2019s something about it that I think is feeling like you\u2019re sort of being treated badly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">And doing it is that, I think that\u2019s also something that you\u2019re in a way like ashamed to sort of feel comfortable with or feel the familiarity of that, like (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Comfortable with feeling like I\u2019m being treated badly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What I have in mind is, and I think this is in a way getting less true, but if somebody says something, you\u2019re in a conversation, and somebody\u2019s like unknowingly very insensitive or hurtful or negligent, in a way, the kind of familiarity is painful, but familiar. And I think it can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">feel safe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">And I don\u2019t, like I say, I think it\u2019s getting less true, and I think you know, there are other situations where you are being treated badly that you just don\u2019t like and you react and you make it clear and so forth. But I think, what I have in mind I guess are the ones where, I mean, I don\u2019t necessarily <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">know what\u2019s going on with you, or you don\u2019t want to tell them and they kind of trample on it somehow, like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know what the things are about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Like my thought about the things that it maybe recreates that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Sort of sense of safety and familiarity in like being treated badly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: In that particular way, yeah. Like as though somebody sort of yeah, without knowing it, trampling on something that is very hurtful to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: That makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">It feels like it does different things at different times, sort of all-purpose. (Long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">Is it bad , well, still better than an eating disorder in terms of like probable mortality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s absolutely true. It\u2019s funny, too, eating crossed my mind too, before when we were talking about it, and I don\u2019t know, maybe those things like to be, is something you often really\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562266\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I mean, like when I talk to like Heather Kate about her eating disorder, like it\u2019s just exactly the same thing. Well not exactly the same thing, but like they intersect a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">She seems to be sort of beating that though, so that\u2019s really good. She\u2019s pregnant again, and I think a lot more comfortable with being pregnant and like what\u2019s happening to her body that she had lost on the ground. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s like sort of more interactive type?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Started out as bulimia and moved into anorexia. So like when I, when she and I were close, she was bulimic, but like I didn\u2019t know about it for the first couple years. But yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">I think she\u2019s gotten a lot more comfortable being like, \u201cNo really, don\u2019t tell me what I weigh,\u201d at the doctor\u2019s office, like asking (inaudible at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I wasn\u2019t, like she and I didn\u2019t really, we\u2019d sort of gotten distant when we got to college, and it was like by the time I knew how bad things had been they were over, but like things were really bad. I\u2019m pretty sure she almost died a couple times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: From being really underweight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">(inaudible at ) started talking about like being skinny being versus fat yesterday. It was very clear in his mind, but like skinny was the healthy one, I was just like shut that shit down. It was like, \u201cMy sister\u2019s fat, and she runs marathons, so what do you do?\u201d Probably not actually fat, but like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">she\u2019s not skinny, and she runs marathons. That\u2019s how it goes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">Yeah, I guess I do tend to think of eating disorders a lot in the same vein. But probably like I don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t have an eating disorder. Like I should, by all rights, in terms of like the way I felt about my body when I was a teenager and the environment that I grew up in, and like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">desperately wanting to control my situation. Like I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: I think that for a lot of people with eating disorders, this is just very anecdotal, they\u2019re often like one or more important people who are very controlling and there\u2019s a sense in like the family environment that there\u2019s a lot that sort of people kind of know but that\u2019s not being talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">about in this very like kind of, like there\u2019s no air in the room sort of way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: No, then they feel (inaudible at ), right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And I don\u2019t see either of those, really in your history. I mean, there are issues, but not those particular ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: And obviously I don\u2019t mean to say like clearly, how you felt about your body and those that were interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">You\u2019re like those things are absolutely problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, no, no, I know. Thanks. That\u2019s actually really helpful, yeah. Yeah, I mean, Heather Kate\u2019s mom is exactly what you described. And also having an eating disorder, but like Heather Kate doesn\u2019t go home any more if she can help it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m thinking particularly of people that more like kind of interact with your type. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure whether that makes it worse or better, self-injury. But I feel like the ultimate risk is low. Like it\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to screw up and like accidentally kill myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562266\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: But it sort of makes it feel like less dangerous, so easier not to make myself not do it. So it\u2019s like from like a social embarrassment perspective, the damage has already been done. Like I\u2019m just not going to the beach any more, that\u2019s just how it\u2019s going to work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: I (inaudible at ) sad and upset about it.
