Good for them. What do you mean by she crossed the line?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: She like took pills or something and she got moody yesterday.

I\u2019m giving a rest on the abstract work and still a rest on the cathedral because they\u2019re so hard. I\u2019m working right now on a still life of green and red peppers. That\u2019s going to be my last work before the Caseytmas vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">THERAPIST: How is your website doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">CLIENT: It hasn\u2019t been updated yet.

Did that ever get talked about? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: We\u2019re still trying to propose it. We\u2019ve got three choices. France, I think, is the one I agree most on. I don\u2019t agree with the West. I\u2019m just not used to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: And France would be like Paris, Leon, something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m just not a West type of person, driving there. I grew up on the East Coast. I know it\u2019s only a trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">THERAPIST: Where in the West were they thinking of going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">CLIENT: Montana. I grew up on the East Coast and the problem is they\u2019ve got dangerous weather as you\u2019d be going through. That\u2019s why I\u2019m most afraid. You know, the tornados?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F\">CLIENT: Austin, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been there once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">THERAPIST: When did you go there? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561780\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: When I was nine, almost ten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Did you have fun?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It\u2019s smaller, but it\u2019s all she could afford.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Without Devon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, but she still has the same size bed she slept in with Devon.

It\u2019s not as good as the past apartment she had.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">THERAPIST: So there\u2019s no spare bedroom that anybody could go and spend the night or anything like that, it\u2019s just a little studio place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. No room, except for the couch she still has. It\u2019s like the only place I could sleep on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Now where is she working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: (pause) I\u2019m forgetful.

(pause) Are you worried about your parents?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">CLIENT: I\u2019m worried about everyone. I\u2019m looking after them when I\u2019m off duty \u2013 most of the time when I\u2019m off duty, most of the time when I\u2019m not busy \u2013 not all the time, but most of the time. Whenever I\u2019m on the computer I turn my head and look at them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Just to make sure they\u2019re okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not on the computer all day, but I would watch TV with them.  My sense is them getting hurt and them getting sick which, hopefully, won\u2019t happen; I hope won\u2019t happen. You know how afraid Gordon is? He still has this fear about Bruce and he\u2019s saying it\u2019s true that Bruce is a murderer his <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AF1\">father, Billy, is a murderer, too \u2013 not as much as Bruce. I\u2019m sorry to put you down in the dumps, but this is true. It\u2019s like it will never end. (agitated) What the fuck? Sorry to use that word, but it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what put us in bad luck. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B1\">THERAPIST: It does feel a little bit like bad luck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200B3\">CLIENT: I must have done something a few years ago that put us in bad luck.

But he is saying, \u201cI know Gordon would freak out about it if I took the metro.\u201d When he said it I thought to myself, \u201cOoh. He\u2019s right.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20167\">FATHER: He said metro? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20169\">THERAPIST: I said metro, but he said the bus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2016B\">FATHER: We try to get him out more.

It might be worth just asking, as long as his . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20173\">MOTHER: They\u2019ve offered him all kinds of \u2013 like do you need somebody to come to the house and bathe him?

Remember we had that chat last time about letting him to go Burger King and have a coffee?

Did you do that? The problem is you\u2019ve got to make sure that the money doesn\u2019t go to him. It\u2019s got to go to a trust, otherwise he loses Social Security. That\u2019s the problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20189\">MOTHER: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2018B\">FATHER: Right.

It\u2019s called a special needs trust and there would be someone else, like Emily would be the trustee and then probably Brett would be the second trustee \u2013 whatever. There are usually two trustees, but it makes sure that Morgan would never get an inheritance, that the inheritance that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2018D1\">he would get would go to the trust so it doesn\u2019t play with his Social Security.

(chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20199\">FATHER: But thankfully there was a sainted \u2013 what were they \u2013 eighty years old? Eighty-year-old people with a son who is 47, older than Gordon, who is musical, can\u2019t seem to get his shit together, excuse my French, but is not violent towards them. We commiserated with them. Thank God they were there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201991\">They were like angels. There was no one else there. We were there on the wrong night so we\u2019ve got to go next Monday. We talked to them. They were sweet. They were just like angels. Thank God there was somebody there for us. They pretty much agreed that we should call the police if anything is up. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201992\">like today, to just give you an idea of what we\u2019re living with, today \u2013 first of all, I was out visiting Emily last night.  He was panicked all night that I was taken away by the conspiracy. The conspiracy continues. The apparent delusion continues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019B\">THERAPIST: And the fact that you come back safe never comforts him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D\">FATHER: No. No. He terrorizes her; it\u2019s gotten to the point where we\u2019re making our bedroom a second living space. Thankfully it\u2019s big enough, but he just can\u2019t let it go, Walter. He just can\u2019t let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">MOTHER: He keeps saying, \u201cWhen the divorce goes through, then they can arrest Bruce and his father, Billy.\u201d Now what does that have to do with anything? I\u2019m of a mind to call the detectives myself and ask if there is really a case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">FATHER: But he\u2019ll go crazy if he finds out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A3\">MOTHER: He keeps saying. \u201cI have to hide out. I have to lay low. I can\u2019t work. I can\u2019t talk to anybody.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">FATHER: I tell him, \u201cCan\u2019t you dust off your resume and update it, just for the future when this is over?\u201d \u201cOh, I can\u2019t think about that.\u201d Then, talk about delusion on top of delusion, he thinks that this will be such a big thing that this case he cracked, that he\u2019s going to be offered a book deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">MOTHER: And a parade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">FATHER: Come one. Even if there was a scintilla of a chance of that, Walter, do you not just be a normal person and have a life and a job? \u201cOh, a desk job I don\u2019t want a . . .\u201d My God. What do you want to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Have you and Dora thought about, as you were saying, if you contacted the police, are you saying for yourself that you want to know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD\">MOTHER: I want to know if there really is a case and if they\u2019re working on it because I don\u2019t believe anything he tells me. Every day it\u2019s something new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF\">FATHER: I wonder if this is too much to ask, probably, but what if you called privately and just say you\u2019re working with some people who have health issues and this came up and you wondered if there was any veracity to this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B1\">THERAPIST: It would be Flourtown?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B3\">MOTHER: It would be Orange County Detectives Department, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B5\">THERAPIST: I can ask. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll tell me, but I can ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B7\">FATHER: Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if you said, \u201cHey, Casey, yeah; there is something. You better be quiet. He is a . . .\u201d I have a feeling they\u2019ll say nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561780\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">THERAPIST: They may not be able to tell me anything, but I can at least ask the question about Bruce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">FATHER: Bruce. What\u2019s the other guy\u2019s name? Brother Charlie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">MOTHER: Yeah, and then Billy is the father who is horribly abusive. He threw the mother out on the street ten years ago with only the clothes on her back; and the boys stayed with the father because he had all the money. They don\u2019t even see their mother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">FATHER: What is the mother\u2019s name?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">MOTHER: Elaine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">FATHER: Elaine Jeffries?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">MOTHER: I guess so, because the divorce isn\u2019t final yet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">FATHER: Is there any other name? Who is the deceased woman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">MOTHER: Penelope French is the girl that he thinks Bruce murdered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">FATHER: How do you spell that? F-R-E-N-C-H?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">MOTHER: Yes. She went to school with Emily. She was at her 15th birthday party. (pause) The whole thing sounds so convoluted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">FATHER: I\u2019m going to just give this to you. Here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">MOTHER: And it\u2019s driving Morgan crazy. The poor kid cries every day. He can\u2019t stand it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">FATHER: Walter, we just want to drive away with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">MOTHER: Look at this. I\u2019m a nervous wreck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">FATHER: And I should tell you we have to come clean. Here I am with Morgan in the store. Dora dropped us both off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">MOTHER: The day before Thanksgiving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">FATHER: We come out in the pouring rain with the last few things we needed, cobbling together what little money we have for whatever. There we are and Dora is nowhere to be found. To this day, I don\u2019t know where she was and what she was doing, Walter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DD\">MOTHER: I told you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF\">FATHER: Just let me finish and then you can tell your story. So here\u2019s Morgan and I, freezing rain, holding umbrellas, have packages. Dora, where are you? Where did you go? To me, she kicked me out so she could do something. This has been an issue because you never know. She could go off and buy liquor <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201DF1\">or drink in a bar. It\u2019s been this way for the holiday thing. It\u2019s pretty much like I have to worry about Dora\u2019s medicine, did she get it? If she didn\u2019t get her Synthroid is she going to go off the wagon? Is she drinking excessively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E1\">MOTHER: Off the wagon? Do you mean if you stop taking Synthroid you\u2019re going to go ballistic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E3\">FATHER: Or you\u2019re going to go mad. There is a really intense, if you look at it \u2013 yeah, you get really irritable, anxiety and . . . So it enhances anything else going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E5\">THERAPIST: What do you take that for? Is that your arthritis?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E7\">MOTHER: Thyroid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Oh, thyroid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EB\">FATHER: So you can see that has a play in the chemical whatever. So anyway, Morgan and I are standing in the rain. We\u2019re waiting for an hour or more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201ED\">MOTHER: No, it wasn\u2019t an hour. It was 20 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201EF\">FATHER: Okay, then she says, \u201cOh, I\u2019m around the side.\u201d I go around and it\u2019s like, Walter, I love this woman, but what is she doing to me? When I trust her to leave with the car and she\u2019s going to leave poor Morgan and I stranded in the rain. I still don\u2019t know what happened. She claims everything from, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201EF1\">\u201cOh, I just wanted to walk into traffic and kill myself, but I changed my mind.\u201d Do you want to say anything else about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F1\">MOTHER: That\u2019s about the size of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling suicidal active?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F5\">MOTHER: I was that day. It was like we had been starving for three days because we had no money. The money was coming in the day before Thanksgiving. It came in, we ran out, I wasn\u2019t feeling well, I felt really anxious, and I was out of my panic medicine. Then we go by Emily\u2019s office and she wants us <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201F51\">to invite Devon to dinner and you know what\u2019s going on with that crap. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561780\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I heard. So she wants him back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">MOTHER: Oh, my God, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FB\">FATHER: She\u2019s not sure, I don\u2019t think and he helps her move into this new apartment, which is smaller and that is nice, but she\u2019s doing well in her job. She interviewed at an ad agency by the computer, so she thinks she\u2019s going to get that job for more money. Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">MOTHER: I was already upset from storming for three days. We were down to drinking water. That\u2019s what we were living on. And then the money came in and we went and bought groceries and things for Thanksgiving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Are you eligible for food stamps?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">MOTHER: Morgan gets them. They cut them because of the sequester, but they don\u2019t come in until the 11th. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">FATHER: And just as a side note, I finally navigated the health care thing, so we think, we\u2019re prayerful that we\u2019re going to get health care from this network thing, but it\u2019s always you\u2019re waiting for something to happen. Sorry, Dora. Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">MOTHER: So we go see Emily and she wants to have Devon and that just sent me into a panic, shaking all over, crying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">THERAPIST: Why would that panic you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20209\">MOTHER: Because I don\u2019t want to see that kid. He broke her heart and that made me nervous. Then he parks in the parking lot at the store and he parked in such a way that it was a little askew, so this woman who parks next to us comes out to try and get in her car and our car is too close to her car, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202091\">so she starts yelling at me about the bad parking job. I\u2019m like, \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t park the car, but I\u2019ll be happy to move it.\u201d So I get out, I go around, I get in the car, I back out . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020B\">FATHER: Which she shouldn\u2019t have done. She should have just let the woman squeeze in her car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">MOTHER: Oh, she was livid, though, this woman; and that set me off again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s hard to be yelled at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">MOTHER: Really. I was already a nervous wreck for ten other reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20213\">FATHER: But also, too, I don\u2019t know if she is making this up, quite frankly, Walter, because right before . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20215\">MOTHER: I told him I was really nervous that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20217\">FATHER: What did you say right before I went in there? \u201cCasey, take Morgan away because I have to call somebody to talk about something.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20219\">MOTHER: I ran out of my Klonopin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021B\">FATHER: But it was more or less as I viewed it, a ruse. I\u2019m always being played kind of, Walter. It\u2019s like, \u201cGo downstairs and get me this,\u201d so she can pour wine in the room. I shouldn\u2019t feel this way, but I feel this way. It\u2019s like I\u2019m just a stooge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know what the two of you are going to do about this. I mean without trust. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2021F\">MOTHER: So anyway, to make a long story short, I go around and the traffic in that parking lot is miserable so it takes me like ten minutes just to get around the parking lot so I can park on the side so when they came out they would be under an awning and they wouldn\u2019t have to walk in the rain because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2021F1\">we were parked really far. Once this woman quits her tirade on me, I parked the car and I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cThere is no point in my living any more.

It\u2019s like her, she can\u2019t cope, it\u2019s medicine, it\u2019s everything, it\u2019s Gordon in the basement violent. When is this going to happen? When is he going to be arrested? And we\u2019re always under constant fear and you\u2019ve got to watch what you say to him or else he flies off <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2023B1\">the handle and is violent.

I used to drive around in the \u201860\u2019s with my best friend, who I\u2019m still friends with, and we\u2019re writing this play. There would be a police officer following <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202451\">us and I\u2019d be swallowing whatever. I\u2019m an old hat at this.

I try to induce that with her and sometimes she\u2019s very accepting and we watch a soap together and we have a lot of fun and we enjoy our lives. But then he comes up, menacing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N202452\">looking out the window, and it\u2019s like, \u201cI guess we had better go upstairs now and retreat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20247\">MOTHER: He just makes me a nervous wreck. He walks into the room and I start shaking like Jell-O.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20249\">FATHER: He makes bacon every day and reeks the house up with that.

Okay, we\u2019re going to go to these things and thank God for you. Thank God for you, Walter.  We\u2019re going to try to give him cigarettes and whatever when he needs it, but is this it? Is this all there is?

I\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t have to include Gordon in it because he\u2019ll lord it over us and act like he\u2019s the owner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20267\">THERAPIST: He doesn\u2019t have any money, does he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20269\">FATHER: Not really, no.

What do you think? People are just going to pay you to hang out and go to a 7-11 and buy packs of cigarettes? As his brother has called it, as my sister Lorelai has called it, totally delusional.

I had no motivation for Thanksgiving. I didn\u2019t even care, but I tried \u2013 right, Casey? I stood on my feet all day long in the kitchen cooking. I didn\u2019t even sit down because I kept having to serve. He helped me a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20273\">FATHER: We tried to cobble it together because Brett came with his girlfriend.

Emily came with Devon and Gordon tried. I asked him to please submerge this whole Bruce Jeffries thing for the day. He almost couldn\u2019t and I said, \u201cGordon, remember you promised?\u201d and then he stopped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20279\">MOTHER: But then as soon as everybody left he got on the phone and started in again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027B\">FATHER: It started again. He gets down on the phone and we think he\u2019s on the phone \u2013 and sometimes he is \u2013 but sometimes he\u2019s just talking into a phone so he can collect his thoughts or because people are listening in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027D\">THERAPIST: He needs medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027F\">MOTHER: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20281\">THERAPIST: I know.

He will literally think in his mind the whole time, fake that he\u2019s well, come home, and kill us. This is the kind of terror we live in. And Walter, I try to stand up to him, but as I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202871\">told you before in my weeping, I\u2019m an actor. I\u2019m a singer.

It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202BD1\">like the U.N. We\u2019d go dutch to lunch maybe twice a month. Then we moved away and then Maria called me and said, \u2018We want to go to lunch again now that you are back.\u201d But she hasn\u2019t called me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BF\">THERAPIST: Can you follow up on that, though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C1\">MOTHER: Yeah, she\u2019ll call me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C3\">THERAPIST: Okay.

I think she needs it too much and I think she relies on it too much. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with her having a little bit, but I do think keeping it more under wraps better than having it out in the open because it is a draw for Gordon to say, \u201cOh, there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202CF1\">my drunken mother. Let me beat her up.\u201d I do think, first of all, it\u2019s better that we once in a while get away from the TV, go upstairs and \u2013 there was the movie with Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman, The Hustler, where Jackie Gleason used to say in the middle of the match, \u201cExcuse me for a second. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202CF2\">going to go in the other room and get some character.\u201d And he freshened up or whatever.

Do you do the coffee thing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20317\">FATHER: She did sort of make a friend with a former grand Knight\u2019s wife because we wound up going to one of the ceremonies together and they bonded a little bit. She\u2019s a very nice lady. I wish she could cultivate that a little bit because she has taken a liking to Dora.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20319\">THERAPIST: It just worries me.

It\u2019s an antidepressant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20321\">MOTHER: That particular day I felt hopeless and overwhelmed.

It\u2019s been a wonderful source of him having an outlet because he\u2019s a musician. He plays it, he keeps it nice for my friend, and I thought wouldn\u2019t it be nice if Dora picked it up and is trying a little bit on there. I know she\u2019s got arthritis, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2033F\">THERAPIST: Did he used to play?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20341\">FATHER: She used to play Baila Gana.

I do, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2035F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re just talking about being with people, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20361\">FATHER: Yes, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20363\">THERAPIST: Anything that makes you not feel like you\u2019re just trapped in your house with Gordon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20365\">FATHER: And that\u2019s how it\u2019s feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20367\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s why I just want anything to get you out of there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20369\">FATHER: Exactly. And we never know what we\u2019re dealing with and when it\u2019s going to be over. Is there a strategy, Walter?

With her background and the connections that she had and the names she could drop, if there was this particular right job, like writing for some professor, historical work, she\u2019s good at that. She\u2019s very good at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20378\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20379\">THERAPIST: As a researcher?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2037B\">FATHER: Transcription.

I just think it helps her if she doesn\u2019t get paranoid. I think she gets <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203D12\">calmer.

It would be something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203E6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203E7\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203E8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203E9\">FATHER: Then as you meet other Altrusa and other friends we\u2019ll do other things and have you channel yourself. Right now I want you to have things that interest you that don\u2019t involve me so that you can enjoy yourself and grow and we can come together then and be fully formed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203EA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203EB\">MOTHER: I know, Casey. It\u2019s just that right now I feel that . . . Yesterday it was Brett calling, \u201cPlease make me a doctor\u2019s appointment. I think there\u2019s something wrong with my stomach.\u201d That woke us up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203EC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203ED\">FATHER: You realize this is Gordon\u2019s age \u2013 what is he, 32?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203EE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203EF\">MOTHER: Thirty-one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F1\">FATHER: Thirty-one. He has to have us make his doctor\u2019s appointments. (chuckles) Walter, I didn\u2019t mind. I did it, but it\u2019s like \u2013 hello?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F3\">THERAPIST: Have you said no at this point? It would just get too ugly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F5\">MOTHER: Probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F7\">FATHER: Not only that, but why would I say no? I love him. I feel bad, like he needs me. At least it\u2019s something I can do for him and I\u2019m not a total [schlavootz] (ph?). I\u2019m of some net benefit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N203F8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N203F9\">THERAPIST: Is that a real word? Schlavootz?

Iris thinks that this Boston guy that they got, they\u2019re paying too much and that he gets injured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20406\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20407\">MOTHER: Another guy from Boston?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20408\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20409\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t hear?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2040A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2040B\">FATHER: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2040C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2040D\">THERAPIST: Ellsbury.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2040E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2040F\">MOTHER: (sucks in breath) We got Jacoby Ellsbury?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20410\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20411\">THERAPIST: $130 million dollars.

I mean I warmed up to Damon when we got him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20420\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20421\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what they compared him to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20422\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20423\">MOTHER: He\u2019s good. I\u2019m surprised Boston let him go. How does Iris feel? That\u2019s way too much money. Nobody needs that much money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20424\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20425\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s worried this guy gets injured a lot. She said he\u2019s like half this season out, so she\u2019s worried about that. But she\u2019s glad they\u2019re doing something about offense. She just thinks they have to do something more about defense still, though. They have to get a pitcher she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20426\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20427\">FATHER: So we\u2019re sort of like baseball widowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20428\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20429\">THERAPIST: We are baseball widowers, exactly. (laughter) I told you, I think, Casey is running all around the place to try to get the cable re-hooked up. They have YES channel or something like that; and Iris said, \u201cOh, Dora is so lucky to have YES.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2042A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2042B\">FATHER: Can you imagine? It\u2019s only for my own safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2042C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2042D\">MOTHER: The games aren\u2019t even on YES anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2042E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2042F\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20430\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20431\">MOTHER: They use the YES announcers, but you\u2019ve got to get the MLB package. You have to pay extra for the MLB package and then they\u2019ll have the pre-game on YES and then you switch to the MLB channel; and then you switch back to YES. And if it\u2019s a home game, you\u2019ll get the YES announcers \u2013 what\u2019s his <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N204311\">name \u2013 Michael Kay and Kenny Singleton. Baseball is getting to be a big rip-off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20432\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20433\">THERAPIST: I agree. I agree that moneywise, it\u2019s just disgusting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20434\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20435\">MOTHER: Like $1,000 would change my life and these guys are making millions for playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20436\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20437\">THERAPIST: Millions. It\u2019s painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20438\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20439\">MOTHER: They\u2019re playing a game. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043B\">FATHER: For me, I love a tennis tournament. I could watch that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043D\">THERAPIST: My dad used to love watching tennis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2043E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2043F\">FATHER: Your dad must have been cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20440\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20441\">THERAPIST: He was an interesting man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20442\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20443\">FATHER: Was he a psychologist, too?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20444\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20445\">THERAPIST: No. He was an entrepreneur; he was a businessman. He was very bright, but he was very wild. He was a drinker. He was a war hero.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20446\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20447\">FATHER: Awesome. World War II? Korean War?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20448\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20449\">THERAPIST: World War II.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044A\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044B\">MOTHER: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044C\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044D\">FATHER: Jeep? Truck? Wow. Do you drive a Jeep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N2044E\"><span data-id=\"P16-N2044F\">THERAPIST: No. Mini Cooper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20450\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20451\">FATHER: I know. I saw your car. I love that car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20452\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20453\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s a sweet little car. He was a good guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20454\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20455\">FATHER: I\u2019m going to say a prayer to him tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N20456\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20457\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N20456-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N20456-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561780\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20458\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20459\">FATHER: It doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2045A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2045B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2045C\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2045D\">FATHER: I\u2019m still saying a prayer. He\u2019s out there somewhere looking out and he\u2019d be very, very proud. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2045E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2045F\">THERAPIST: He was a real narcissist. He was very interesting, but he didn\u2019t really pay much attention to me, to the three of us, the kids. It was all about him. We were audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20460\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20461\">FATHER: Are you oldest?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20462\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20463\">THERAPIST: The youngest.

I relate to the baby thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20466\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20467\">MOTHER: I\u2019m the oldest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20468\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20469\">THERAPIST: Are you? The responsible one. You need to be carefree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2046A\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2046B\">MOTHER: I don\u2019t know what it \u2013 I was born grown up.

Okay, I\u2019m not thrilled about the hair currently, (laughing) but it\u2019s growing on me and I\u2019m trying to. Who is this strange woman in my bed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N2046E\"><span data-id=\"P17-N2046F\">MOTHER: The kids say it makes me look ten years younger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20470\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20471\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it is. It\u2019s a nice cut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N20472\"><span data-id=\"P17-N20473\">FATHER: I love her, though, and I want her to have that.

They\u2019re just trying to help him in any way they can. How do we deal with this? And the connection we made with them was remarkable.
