She\u2019s not a hat person right now. So\u2026 and it\u2019s big enough that it\u2019ll fit her next year. So Jackson [ph?] was home sick yesterday from school. He was, I think, puking all night. It hit the floor. So he was feeling sort of better <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">by the time I came on board yesterday, and then Monica [ph?] and Frank both came home last night and both of them were green. So I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to get today but\u2026 both in terms of what things are going to be like when I show up and also in terms of what I\u2019m going to be feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">during the next couple of days. [0:55] I\u2019m sort of keeping James at very long arm\u2019s length and (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I\u2019m a little surprised they\u2019re having you go, given the\u2026 I mean I can see that they need the help but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t\u2026 yeah, I feel like if I\u2019m going to get it I already got it. And I also, yeah, I don\u2019t know what\u2026 yesterday Monica [ph?] texted me as I was going there to be like this is the situation, can you bring some crackers. And I think she sort of was thinking about staying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">home and ended up not staying home because he was done being sick. He just needed to rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Well I hope you don\u2019t get it. [2:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Thanks. Thank you. I mean I sort of feel like it comes with the territory but also it sucks. (pause) But it was good to see them again. Sharon [ph?] has gotten\u2026 she\u2019s sort of learning words and it\u2019s more like she\u2019s gotten much better at communicating but\u2026 so she can say more now, which is good. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">But mostly she just shakes her head because she doesn\u2019t want to eat anything. [3:04] And so she\u2019ll ask to sing a song but the only\u2026 she says AB or ABC. The ABC is because that was her favorite song at one point. And she goes like this for the Itsy Bitsy Spider. But she doesn\u2019t want to sing either of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">those songs. She has a very specific song in mind and the only way to\u2026 and if you start singing a different song she\u2019s like no, makes lots of noise. Turned out to be I\u2019m a Little Teapot. (laughter) So we sang that six or seven times yesterday. (pause) I don\u2019t think Monica\u2019s [ph?] really a fan of\u2026 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">don\u2019t think she\u2026 the 18 month to 3 year period is her favorite developmental period. She\u2019s like yeah, I\u2019m really glad you got to know her as a baby so there\u2019s some love accrued from that. [4:14] (laughter) I can\u2019t tell whether Sharon [ph?] is better for me than she is for Monica [ph?] or whether I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">mind it less. But I don\u2019t know, she seems about the same to me. But she\u2019s sort of, at least with Monica, [ph?] getting into the very demanding of things and sort of destructive in terms of she just opens doors and pulls shit out. So I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m perfectly happy to be the one that she does not open <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200155\">doors and pull shit out for. (pause) So I don\u2019t know whether this is the last few days or just yesterday or the last week, so I don\u2019t really have a good sense of time on this, but it\u2019s\u2026 I think about cutting myself pretty regularly as it is, but the things I have been thinking about have been sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200156\">increasingly violent it feels like. [6:06] And I don\u2019t know. It feels like I\u2019m clearly in control of them but that itself is really frustrating to me. (pause) I\u2019m not worried that I\u2019m going to do anything to myself that\u2019s irreversible or particularly dangerous. I just sort of wish that I was. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562096\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: In a way you feel kind of constricted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I\u2019m presenting it as something that\u2019s just over the last week and it\u2019s more like\u2026 that\u2019s not a\u2026 it\u2019s not a totally new thing. Or it\u2019s not something that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 this is going to sound sort of stupid but I guess in the last couple of days it\u2019s occurred to me that I could actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">tell you about it. [8:04] So that\u2019s a thing I can say. (pause) I have a copy of T.S. Eliot\u2019s Four Quartets that I keep in my bag because it\u2019s small, and so it\u2019s something that I can read when I\u2019m bored because I will read it on the train a lot. I think I\u2019m thinking of this because I thought of a line <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">from [inaudible] And so the other day I was\u2026 wanted to go to a cafe and it wasn\u2019t open yet, and so I went to the\u2026 that caf\u00e9 near [inaudible] to get a cup of tea and wait for it. [9:44] And I had a sort of like strange and sort of amusing interaction with an older man. So I was at a large table, a largish <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200193\">table. But it was the only one; there weren\u2019t any open tables, so he sat down with me. So I was reading and I was like he\u2019s going to make... he\u2019s going to talk to me. He\u2019s going to say something. Sure enough he was like what are you reading. And he saw that it was Eliot and he was like is it Prufrock? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200194\">And I said no, it\u2019s a different one. And he just really wanted to talk to me about my life and tell me how to run it. He just really wanted to do that. And I was like okay, I was like you seem like somebody who needs to spend his days talking to people. We can do this. I guess it was\u2026 I noticed it because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200195\">it\u2019s very typical for me. I feel like\u2026 I honestly feel like I\u2019m a magnet for older men who are looking for a sympathetic listener. [11:15] (laughter) I don\u2019t really feel like there\u2019s a good way to handle it, and that if I sort of brush him off and say no, I\u2019m going to read my book, I feel like kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200196\">of an asshole. And if I don\u2019t then I\u2019m sort of like, I don\u2019t know, forced into playing this part that I\u2019m not sure I feel so great about. (pause) I think I\u2019ve gotten considerably more approachable in the last year or two, based on the fact that there have sort of been more people who are approaching <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200197\">me. People ask me for directions all the fucking time. I\u2019m the worst person to ask for directions. (laughter) I\u2019ve heard of that place, usually Brown undergraduate admissions. I\u2019m like I know there\u2019s a sign somewhere that I walk past on a regular basis but I couldn\u2019t tell you where it is. I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200198\">mostly I like it. [13:37] I like that people feel able to approach me. People end up asking me for help on the subway a whole lot, [inaudible] with the card machines, which is good except then I miss my train. But I don\u2019t know. I think the Eliot quote that I was thinking of is like I descend lower, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200199\">descend something into the world of perpetual something. World not world but that which is not world. [inaudible] he\u2019s talking about the subway. [15:19] And probably some other [inaudible] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Descend lower, descend, I think, only into the world of perpetual, maybe, solitude something. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually solitude.

[17:57] Yeah. So it sort of feels like often what I end up doing in here is (pause) it feels like in here I often\u2026 I\u2019m sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">trying to find some way to get into that world in my head, which is much darker. And then elsewhere I spend a lot of time trying to find some way not to do that. And they both end up being hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine there are moments where I maybe feel a little more approachable. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it\u2019s\u2026 it feels to me like there\u2019s moments where I sort of recognize that my fantasize\u2026 my fantasies about you not being approachable are fantasies, if that makes sense. [19:38] But I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yeah, more like those sort of emerge from the way things feel where talking to me is not necessarily true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. (pause) I get so angry at myself. [20:59] (pause) It was\u2026 last night I was brushing my teeth and it was like I had to look away from the mirror. I wanted to either smash the mirror or smash my face. (pause) It would feel nice cutting myself [inaudible] it\u2019s just more <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">frustrating. I\u2019m sure the more I do it the more I think about it. [23:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So was that right there a bit of the anger at yourself for doing it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Well you sort of\u2026 it was like the\u2026 this kind of tightening expression that went across your face as you said the more you do it the more you think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: And I was imagining that you were\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, I sort of feel like this is\u2026 it\u2019s only a problem of my own creation, and now I\u2019m stuck with it. But I also (pause) yeah, I get angry with myself because it feels like I\u2019m choosing this and I know that my choices are making it worse but I don\u2019t make different choices. [24:32] (pause) Something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">like even the bad choices that I do make aren\u2019t actually enough. It doesn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: What do you mean they\u2019re not enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: In that (pause) I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2026 it has not, in the last however long, a long time, cut myself such that it will scar permanently or hurt myself seriously, but that\u2019s what I want. [26:08] (pause) Feels sort of like walking Lola because she\u2019s this little dog, she\u2019s about 20 or 30 pounds, and she will <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">never ever stop pulling at the leash. [27:29] She\u2019ll never stop doing it. And she\u2019s pulling as hard as she can. And\u2026 but she never\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, whose dog is Lola?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: She\u2019s Amanda\u2019s dog. She used to be my dog. Or any dog like her. But she\u2019s a little dog. She\u2019s never going to be able to pull hard enough to get away but\u2026 just because I\u2019m always going to be stronger than she is. I\u2019m just a lot bigger. But I can\u2019t ever stop holding on. I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">of want to let go but (pause) it\u2019s pretty clearly not [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I guess that part of you is, much of the time, is physically craving [ph?] for what?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562096\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. [28:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah.

[31:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s one thing that fits about your analogy to\u2026 with Lola, is you can\u2019t really reason with Lola. You can\u2019t really say all right, look, yeah we can\u2019t go over there because that\u2019s the highway, or we can\u2019t keep walking because we have to get back. Or\u2026 but tomorrow we\u2019ll go a little further <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">or we\u2019ll go over there or whatever. I think similarly what you\u2019re describing is either kind of letting go or giving in or not, and continuing to have to deal with the pulling and the pulling and the pulling, the pulling. And there\u2019s no conversation, there are no other demands. [32:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: I mean I do try to reason myself out of it. And I sort of step back and say okay, well what is this actually doing for me. And sometimes I can see what\u2019s it\u2019s doing for me, but that doesn\u2019t seem to touch it, if that makes sense. (pause) Yeah, so (pause) it makes it less scary when I can say <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">well, this wouldn\u2019t actually be an appropriate response to whatever I\u2019m mad about myself for, or I can see that I\u2019m upset about this thing or sad about this thing and I\u2019m getting angry with myself here. [34:09] It sort of makes it sort of less monstrous but\u2026 yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I (pause) [inaudible] you mentioned of\u2026 you\u2019re mentioning like a criminal [ph?] you\u2019re brushing teeth, brushing your teeth. And also, talking here made me think that maybe something that triggers it is taking care of yourself.

[ph?] [inaudible] said\u2026 you were saying that Monica\u2019s [ph?] not crazy about the 18 to, I forget what you said, like 36 months or so. I was thinking, you\u2019ve been coming here, what, 20 months, 18 months? And you\u2019re talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">about Sharon [ph?] [inaudible] communicate, which is what you\u2019ve been talking about, worried about the way that Monica\u2019s [ph?] going to get mad Sharon\u2019s [ph?] pulling shit out of drawers and thrashing around and being destructive. [38:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: That\u2019s pretty good. I didn\u2019t realize it was that long.
