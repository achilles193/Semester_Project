There\u2019s a sign that said, God I can\u2019t remember the names of the church, it\u2019s First Church I think, that has sort of a Bach and Brahms concept. That\u2019s my favorite. I feel like everything Bach writes is really serene on some level. There\u2019s a lot of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">emotion going on but there\u2019s sort of a certainty that everything\u2019s going to be okay. I really like that. All lady friends like. He\u2019s just sort of ubiquitous in church music and he wrote so much church music and so, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Went to bed earlier last night, which was good. James and I were watching a movie again, which is also good. [inaudible at 00:01:37]. A friend of mine -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Someone who [inaudible at 00:01:47]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. I have a friend he lives in Los Angeles now but I sang in the choir with him when I was in San Antonio. And he writes so he did an interview with him this month. So that sort of prompted let\u2019s do this again. It\u2019s really good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Not the most interesting thing he\u2019s written. I mean it\u2019s a decent interview but, yes. Actually it was kind of tough for reasons that are not that clear. I can\u2019t tell whether I was really irritable or the kids were just really irritating. [Laughs] Somewhere in there. Also they really sort of wanted me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">to play with them and interact with them pretty much constantly all day, which was very much the case when I started working there. And so they\u2019ve just, they moved towards being far more, they\u2019ll just play on their own a lot. And for whatever reason yesterday I was sort of, it was very draining to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">I ended up for a good chunk of the day I had, I really wanted to self-injure, which hasn\u2019t, I haven\u2019t since mid-February and that sort of impulse has been less to the forefront. I think about it occasionally but it\u2019s not the first place my mind goes. So that sort of troubled me. Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">It feels like something that I might not be able to have control over and I feel like the important thing to do is to keep reminding myself that in fact I do have entire control over it; it\u2019s just me. And so I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">One way of thinking about it is really just wanting to be alone and take care of myself yesterday and that wasn\u2019t really an option. And so Franco says okay here\u2019s something that you have to take care of, so you have to think about this now. But, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Maybe you were feeling abandoned?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Kind of like sort of put upon but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. [Pause] I started reading this memorandum (ph) that I was talking about with James last week. The first chapter is about a doctor losing her mom to cancer and it\u2019s this horrible story. She\u2019s, the mother\u2019s 45 and she\u2019s a non-smoker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">And she lives on this sort of like back to nature plot of land out in Iowa and doesn\u2019t use any pesticides or anything and she has lung cancer. And by the time they catch it because it\u2019s lung cancer there\u2019s nothing you can do and she\u2019s dead a month and half later. And that\u2019s it. And so the author\u2019s sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">of describing just how much that sort of destroyed her and how huge that grief was. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562482\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: When were you reading it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: I was reading it actually last night on the train home. And it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know I\u2019m sort of jealous. I think I might have had the same experience when I read it before but I don\u2019t really remember reading it before. I think not because of reading grievance but just because I don\u2019t remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">books that well. I just don\u2019t have that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t have the experience of having a parent who took care of me so well that I felt like I couldn\u2019t exist without them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I see. The thing that this writer lost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause] Sometimes it\u2019s just sort of a cool thing to say it seems. When somebody says it was worse having their parents be divorced than having one of my parents be dead because everyone kept telling me that my mom wasn\u2019t gone. Or it feels like that was sort of the mentality around me; I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">don\u2019t think everybody kept telling me that but it felt like I couldn\u2019t get any acknowledgement that yes, no she\u2019s just gone. I just woke up one day and she was gone. But I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">I meant to look up a recipe and make [one of the kids\u2019] (ph) dessert but I forgot. For Sharon (ph) peanut butter and jelly muffins. It\u2019s really good. You put the jam right on the muffin when you bake it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">James maybe gets actually why now. I can tell because I used it and it\u2019s making me really, really anxious. [Pause] I want to say I hope we stay here. Actually any change would be good. It\u2019s been this weird thing that we don\u2019t have any stability that would continue to be here but we can\u2019t afford to even <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">get out of the city. And so I\u2019ve just been in Denver and haven\u2019t traveled pretty much anywhere for the last year. And so I\u2019m feeling I\u2019m both cut off from friends across the country and cut off in some ways from friends here because I can\u2019t say I\u2019m going to stay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Whether or not you\u2019ll stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Sure it sounds appealing [inaudible at 00:15:47].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: So I read something cool about organs the other day, church organs. So I mean one friend is a pretty fair musician who\u2019s talking about listening to and [inaudible at 00:17:10] an organ asylum. It was just sort of boring; he wasn\u2019t very impressed with it. And for me I don\u2019t know anything about, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">I don\u2019t know enough about music to be able to tell the difference between something that\u2019s well played and something that\u2019s poorly played. I mean I can tell when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re playing but when it\u2019s not rehearsed enough but I can\u2019t tell the difference between a good interpretation and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200452\">a poor interpretation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">So I was asking another friend who\u2019s a church organist about it and she said well you know part of it is what stops do they use. And so as it turns out none of the it\u2019s not written into the music which types of sounds you should play when on the organ, which do you know how an organ works at all? <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">Okay, I have a very vague sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I know it\u2019s a big piano with pipes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes, so it has big pipes and you pull out different stops to make so basically you can sound like pretty much any type of instrument depending on which pipes you use. You can have hundreds of different qualities of sound and those qualities aren\u2019t written into the music; it doesn\u2019t tell you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">which ones to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562482\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: At which there really is not one to one or even close to correspondence between the keys you\u2019re playing and the sounds you\u2019re going to get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes or you can play the same piece and get a hundred different sounds depending on which ones you touch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: I get it. As if you played the same notes on a piano or a violin or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes, so I did not know this and now I do, [laughs] which I guess explains why pianist or organists, why people who why people get so into because people get so into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Into organs? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes. I mean it\u2019s clearly not that many people [laughing]. It\u2019s sort of a ridiculous thing because you\u2019re not really playing an instrument so much as like you\u2019re playing a building. It takes a whole the reason that they\u2019re in churches is because they have to be installed in a building. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">a whole it\u2019s a building space. And you have practice organs that so my grandparents had two full sized grand pianos and an organ and wherever they moved they had to find a room that was big enough for those. But that\u2019s just a little bit bigger than a piano. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Right, I think I\u2019ve seen those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes, but the whole, the real thing is huge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s not sort of kind of sacrative (ph) but it\u2019s so big that it has to be that big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes, because it\u2019s all based on how big the pipes have to be and some of them are 20 feet long and I think that\u2019s why to make the really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Low tones. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: low tones, yes. But going back to Bach one of the things that I fear, learned about in this year was that the entire time he was composing he was the church organist. That was his main sort of area of what he was interested in. What he was composing for was mostly church music. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I see, the finest healing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes. There\u2019s a sort of, I don\u2019t really know what to call it, but it\u2019s called Lent Madness, it\u2019s like March Madness but with saints. [Laughing] And they have a racket of different things to make the [inaudible at 00:21:39]. So Bach was one of them this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: A little different. How do you tell who\u2019s, what like in March Madness it\u2019s who wins the basketball game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes, you just vote. They have a team of people who research them and write little bios of them and talk about stuff. But yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s a saints popularity contest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Basically. So you were saying you were feeling like a nerd yesterday so I wouldn\u2019t worry so much about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">[Laughter]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Very reassuring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: My aunt Margaret, she\u2019s my mom\u2019s sister and she works with a psychologist and she\u2019s an artist, she drives me nuts. She has posted two things on Facebook in the last two days and the first two little pictures. And the first was a cartoon of a guy goes to the doctor and he says doctor, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">really bad. I feel really awful and I don\u2019t really know why. And the doctor says okay well go home and meditate three times a day and eat well and exercise and give up all pesticides, eat only organic, blah, blah, blah, and then come back to me in a month. This is the thing that will fix everything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">And I thought sometimes that\u2019s the truth; sometimes you get lung cancer. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562482\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">That\u2019s the first one. And the second one was be nice to your nieces and nephews; someday they\u2019ll be the ones smuggling liquor into your nursing home. And she says Tanya, are you onboard with this? And I said sure. And I thought does she know that my grandparents on my other side were alcoholics? Probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">not because both of them were actually putting pretty heavy pressure on their children to bring them liquor in the hospital before they were dying. I don\u2019t know if anybody did; I feel like that one could go either way. That was their dependence. I don\u2019t think she knows that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">My dad has a great loyalty to Margaret. I think in large part because when he and my mom got divorced she basically picked him. She basically said I\u2019m not going to make David out to be the bad guy and so I\u2019m going to breach with my mom and her family and she was a friend to my dad after that. So the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">cynical side of me thinks that it\u2019s both something he probably really needed and a really good occasion to have to cause a breach with her family. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: If that\u2019s what she was looking for you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. [Pause] It\u2019s funny. I don\u2019t know how to [let down] (ph). I don\u2019t know how <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: With Margaret?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: With my parents getting divorced. I asked my dad a few months ago whether he knew that my mom was as depressed as she was when they got married. He said no, no I really didn\u2019t. But then he said he wasn\u2019t really comfortable talking about it on its own. It\u2019s sort of like I wonder whether knowing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">more about it would sort of make a difference emotionally. I sort of think it probably wouldn\u2019t. But maybe I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: I do think that you have, I\u2019ve sort of talked about it, some internal version of her that\u2019s really a very positive one and that you feel very connected to. However much that had a basis in the reality of your interactions or not I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t know I think that release is somewhere <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">where you and I are at though I\u2019m not sure about specifics much more than that, I mean except that you seem to feel and been and be kind of overshadowed by grief. And also are feeling confused I think, unsure where you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">It seems possible to me that you\u2019re feeling with me something, some part of the more positive version of her and your relationship with her from before she left. And that both makes you more able to be in touch with some of grief over her leaving and afraid I\u2019m going to leave. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: That\u2019ll be for [inaudible at 00:33:03].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m having sort of more tentative thoughts maybe what you\u2019re reading about which is I don\u2019t know somehow I have the sense that you said you felt as though everybody was saying she\u2019s not gone, she is still here; see your mom in the same way, whatever. And, which just wasn\u2019t true I guess. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">there\u2019s some way that nobody helping you with how she left and that she left made it harder to keep in touch with what was good that had been there between you. Again how much that was in your mind or in the action\u2019s the same. If somebody said <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s like not really getting any traction when I would say that things are different now. Sort of made me think well maybe things were always this way, does that make sense? Maybe things were always so distant.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562482\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yes. Sort of somebody saying yes the world kind of just ended for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">I was talking to Carter [and Nicole] (ph) a week or two ago and I was I mean I was just sort of talking about my family and I sort of told her what was going on there. And she said I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t understand leaving your kids. She said I don\u2019t <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: She said ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t understand leaving your kids. I just don\u2019t, I don\u2019t understand it. I said yes, me neither. [Laughs] I don\u2019t know. In some ways I do though. Thinking about what it was like being suicidal; in some ways I do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: What do you have in mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Just that the things that are important to you stop being important. There\u2019s just nothing more important than wanting to die. There\u2019s nothing that is, that can get in the way of that. The best you can do is to remember that used to be important to you sort of project that someday it will be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">again. But that\u2019s really hard to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I have been thinking when you said you don\u2019t get it either that it seems to me something that is already familiar to you is abetting yourself most of the time. What I have in mind is beating off how you feel or the way that something happened mattered to you or I\u2019m thinking mostly in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">own mind but sometimes with other people and certainly that said now I think that needs to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">And maybe that\u2019s related to what you\u2019re saying about suicide. I\u2019m not thinking so much that that\u2019s leading to but like you were saying about yesterday morning maybe that it\u2019s a reaction to feeling like you can\u2019t take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t remember what I was thinking, it\u2019s [inaudible at 00:40:58] anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: What you were saying today about yesterday morning. You were saying you had been thinking of cutting yourself and you haven\u2019t been in a while. And it seemed, and you had the thought after saying that, do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But actually it was a way of getting your own attention and keeping yourself focused on how upset you were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yes, that was sort of going in a different direction in terms of thinking well I think it\u2019s very easy to think of children as extensions of your own personality. If you do that then it doesn\u2019t seem, it seems to me to be much more okay to abandon myself and some stuff than to abandon somebody else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I see. Your kid is some part of you, where if you went away -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s definitely how Mom feels about us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yes that\u2019s certainly how you\u2019ve described her often demeanor. We should finish up now. It occurs to me do you I\u2019m willing to look up the rest and you can write it down if you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Oh that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not I can look it up at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: No problem.
