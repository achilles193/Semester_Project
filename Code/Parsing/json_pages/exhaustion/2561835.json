Because we can look at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: It can stay at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Okay.

So, it\u2019s semi-regular. You could have it. (chuckles) Looks like I have it most days, but some day\u2014there are some Monday where I have someone scheduled. It looks like every other. So, next week, we had scheduled for Wednesday, the 5th. But I can do March 3rd, which would be the Monday, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">at 12:30, if you prefer that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I think so. Yeah. I can (inaudible at 00:00:41).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, that\u2019s next Monday, the 3rd. You can have the 12:30. But then, the following Monday, the 10th, I don\u2019t have the 12:30 open. But I could do\u2014then you could have the Wednesday, I think it was 3:30 we had looked at?  On the 12th?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Do you have anything else on Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Right now, I don\u2019t. Not unless somebody canceled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Okay. So, let\u2019s just hold on, I guess, to\u2014it was at Wednesday, the 10th?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Wednesday, the 12th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I have a 3:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Okay.

Yeah. So, it looks like you could have a Monday at 12:30 every other week, because then, like the 17th, the 12:30\u2019s open on Monday. And then we\u2019ll just play it\u2014after that, we can see which . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">So, where are things today? I saw you laughed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: You were buzzing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: (sighs) I feel like every time I come, I have no idea how I\u2019m feeling. Week after week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Well, I think part of this time is for you to be able to have a quiet-enough space to figure out what you\u2019re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: And I was thinking about it today, because this morning, with all of his doctors\u2019 appointments and things, I was excited just to go out. (chuckles) Monday and Tuesday, we\u2019ve decided (inaudible at 00:02:27) all stay home with him (inaudible at 00:02:28). And then, yesterday, this\u2014I guess I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">only been home with him for two days, but it deteriorated into I\u2019m not sure I ever changed out of my pajamas. And I watched an entire season of a TV show I\u2019ve been watching. (chuckles) I sort of just gave in, I guess. Which was nice, but if I did it for another day, it would become really depressing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200392\">And actually, I could\u2019ve easily deteriorated. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">But instead, I went for a run.  We had a puppy visitor. I don\u2019t know. Every day, I could easily go down the tubes. Or be a good day. Depending on little things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: What, for you, determines a good day versus down\u2014what feels like a day that\u2019s down the tubes, and what feels like a good day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: (sighs) I mean, unfortunately, it has a lot to do with him, because\u2014this morning he was having a lot of pain. And he was really stressed about going to the doctor. And I made it worse by going to the wrong place completely. We ended up having to park, go in, realize we were at the wrong doctor\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">appointment. (chuckles) Go. Find somewhere else. And getting in and out of the car is exhausting. Not really, but not in public yet. And just the first few people we walk by, we get what\u2014who is that. (chuckles) It was just a long (inaudible at 00:03:51).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561835\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">And also, to have\u2014I made a mistake and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And then feel like you\u2019re rushing or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Well, (inaudible at 00:03:56) go and see a new doctor. And then, fill out a whole new set of paperwork. And tell our story all over again.  (chuckles) And then, he got talk about pain drugs again. Just been such a tough subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">And he got home. And I decided I would go for a run, because I knew I was coming here and I knew I needed to put some warmer clothes on (inaudible at 00:04:20). (chuckles) And so, that was good. And then, I got a text that our puppy was visiting downstairs. So, I (inaudible at 00:04:25) the puppy up. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">Josh immediately got up and started playing with the puppy. And it was almost snapped into a good trajectory (inaudible at 00:04:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">I mean, Josh came home in so much pain. His back was killing him. He just had the talk about pain drugs. I thought things were going down the tubes, but they didn\u2019t, so\u2014well, who knows what\u2019ll happen when I get home, but\u2014and I left and he was telling me how he was going to try to make lasagna. Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">was (inaudible at 00:04:56). (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. I mean, it seems \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: So, you\u2019re living in apprehension of what it\u2019s going to be like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:05:06) pain and going out in public, for him, also really affect me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I wonder what\u2019s the\u2014it seems like there\u2019s not much of a separation between what\u2019s happening with him and how you\u2019re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Well, if I can do the things that\u2014(inaudible at 00:05:25) running.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Then you feel you have more of a barrier between (inaudible at 00:05:29).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. And on Thursday, I was\u2014when\u2014I saw you on Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I did go for a run. Forced myself to be nice to his mom. The next day, I was still pretty\u2014my friends took me out for a couple drinks and his mom offered to stay there until 10:00, when I came home, which was really helpful. Although, I think this is not a good pattern of things I keep doing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">I get crazed and I end up doing so much stuff to try to calm down that I\u2019m exhausted (ph). (chuckles)  And I end up staying up in my pajamas for the whole weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">But it wasn\u2019t too\u2014it wasn\u2019t as bad as the last time I did that. (chuckles) So, I guess that\u2019s good. I don\u2019t know. I think the enormity of the months we\u2019re going to have to wait is just really frightening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And you don\u2019t really know how long you have to wait, right? So, it\u2019s the idea that it\u2019s going to be months, but how many?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, he\u2019s really\u2014my parents were over. He\u2019s the one who said this to me, about how he wished he\u2019d never agree to the surgery. Ever since he got his Pacemaker in, he just went downhill (inaudible at 00:06:42) struggling with the, \u201cThis all really have to happen.\u201d (chuckles) He\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">(inaudible at 00:06:46) my (inaudible at 00:06:47) lawyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">And I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to believe that he would have not been able to leave the hospital without this machine at this point. It\u2019s just destroyed him so much.  And my parents were trying to see if he would go out to dinner on Saturday night (inaudible at 00:07:05). (chuckles) It\u2019s exhausting for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">him just to get out of the house. And I don\u2019t know. I guess we had a fantasy that he would bounce back quicker. And he is bouncing back fast, but (crosstalk at 00:07:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561835\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a big change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, he just\u2014he\u2019s just a shell. (chuckles) He\u2019s a shell. And I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been trying to tell myself that he went from a breathing tube to walking around the halls in about a week \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: which is pretty fast. So, I\u2019m just hoping the next week, things will be further along than I could\u2019ve thought they would be. But I don\u2019t know. Thinking about these makes\u2014I probably horrified (inaudible at 00:07:50). I think really getting down. (inaudible at 00:07:54) to you. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">It\u2019s so much more work than I thought. Just every day.  And I don\u2019t foresee most of that going away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well, I think it\u2019s hard to know what to predict. Because you\u2019ve never been through this before. I mean, this is\u2014there\u2019s nothing comparable in your life or his life to know what the trajectory will be, how you\u2019ll (ph) adjust to what the work actually is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: (sighs) Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the limitations of the device, though, are so huge that they cannot get a whole lot better. I mean, there\u2019s just not a way around it. (chuckles) I mean, even just the thought of in two weeks, I won\u2019t have to give him (inaudible at 00:08:41) antibiotics twice a day <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">is so exciting, because just remembering to give those and doing it properly? I mean, also, I\u2019m pretty not a very good calm and collected person. And so, having to do everything properly so I don\u2019t hurt him multiple times a day (chuckles) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot of pressure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: it\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m (inaudible at 00:09:04) so much mental energy. I was watching him training a puppy. After two times of getting the puppy to sit, the puppy\u2019s exhausted. (chuckles) I feel like that a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">Last night, I was changing his dressing. And he wants to wait until the nighttime to do it. And changing his dressing involves making our living room sterile. And sterile gloves and sterile everything and not touching anything so that everything stays sterile. And cleaning him in just the right way <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">so that that\u2019s all sterile. And then, cleaning up this giant pile of medical waste that I\u2019ve created by doing all this. And doing it (inaudible at 00:09:44) him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">And last night, I was really tired and I was trying so hard to be really careful. And yet, I still poked him in some way that (sighs) caused him pain for a while. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: So, it sounds like part of it is made harder that he wants to wait until nighttime to do it.  Yet, you\u2019re the one that\u2019s actually having to do all of this. Would it be easier for you to push to have him change the dressing in the morning or in the middle of the day? Is there a time when it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">would be better for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. Soon, we\u2019ll figure it out, but, I mean, things are still settled down a tiny bit, but not really. I mean, just the other day, we had three nurses in house. One wanting to learn how to do the dressing and I was going to go to school. They\u2019re like, \u201cWell, can you do it so that we can see <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200791\">and then, watch you and also teach this lady?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, there isn\u2019t a routine yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: And (inaudible at 00:10:49) when there will be one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s a lot of constant adjustment that you\u2019re being asked to make. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561835\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s exhausting. (inaudible at 00:11:03) have been a bit of schoolwork (sighs) which is causing me stress. And, I mean, I was sitting on the couch, watching TV last\u2014yesterday, I guess, thinking about how I should probably do some work and the thought was just so exhausting.

I wish I could say the exact reverse (chuckles) but it\u2019s not quite the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: You guys are in very different positions. What would you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your honest response?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Running this morning, I was trying to think of what\u2014why am I doing all this? What do I hope for? I mean, I guess I\u2019m doing it for him.  And, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t decide what\u2019s keeping me going, I guess. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Do you want to keep going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: I do, for some reason. I mean, I wanted to give up. My feelings wanting to give up are much less than the reverse. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know why I wanted to go to the hospital every day, even the snowstorms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Mmm. But you did, and that\u2019s really meaningful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: I mean, it\u2019s only \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:38) understand why you feel the way you do, but it does seem like you\u2019re coming to know what you feel with much more certainty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: You think so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: I do. (chuckles) I don\u2019t necessarily know more than you do, but in listening to what you question in here, the big question of do you want to be with him seems to be something you ask yourself less (inaudible at 00:13:08) here.  I mean, I only get a limited picture of what\u2019s going on inside your head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: But the past couple times that I\u2019ve asked you question of, \u201cWell, do you really want to be with him? Do you want to do this at all?\u201d You seemed to answer was quite a lot of certain that yeah. You don\u2019t know why you want to do it, but you do. Right? You find yourself questioning less. Does <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">that resonate with you? Am I getting a skewed picture?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: No, it does. It does. Things are just so up and down, up and down. But I guess yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s certainly not the picture that you envisioned for the two of you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean, taking it out in public today was definitely painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: What did you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Well, I think the worst was when we were meeting this doctor. She seemed really great, but you could just\u2014it was a little\u2014it was overwhelming for everyone, I think. Including her. I mean, I don\u2019t know, maybe \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: What doctor was this? What did she \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: It was just a primary care doctor. And she was saying things like, \u201cHe has (inaudible at 00:14:38) for you. You\u2019re (inaudible at 00:14:39) to be mine.\u201d I don\u2019t know. Just were pitying things, which everyone says, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just I guess we both just want to do it and get through it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">and not have to (chuckles) face how abnormal it is all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s not abnormal for him anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Right?  This is not the first time he\u2019s heard this story. (inaudible at 00:15:04) hearing that isn\u2019t\u2014it doesn\u2019t feel like empathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561835\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: You know what? Actually, I mean, a lot of things that are good for him are not good for me. And I had a conversation with my dad about it, which was nice. On Saturday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Can you say more\u2014what do you mean, the things that are good for him are not good for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Well, like my dad coming over and saying lots of things that are very\u2014that seem to me to be not condescending or just overly almost Hallmark. (chuckles) He loves it. And to me \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So, Josh feels really supported by that. But you getting exposed to it feel \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: Not listened to, I guess. It\u2019s just not what I need. But I was so grateful when my parents came over and they offered to take us out to dinner (inaudible at 00:15:58) just took me out to dinner.  And again, I was\u2014I think I was still in my pajamas, so I put some clothes on. (chuckles) And went <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">out. And had a glass of wine. And I don\u2019t know, I was so relieved, I guess, to be out at the restaurant with them that I just said a lot of things to my dad that were helpful. Like that. How it helped (inaudible at 00:16:26) for Josh. And how helpful he is for me, sometimes, and what he could do differently. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">And my mom backed me up on some of it, which was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">And then, he also\u2014I let him fix a bunch of stuff in my house. And, I don\u2019t know, it was very positive (crosstalk at 00:16:44).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:16:43) Yeah. I think that in figuring out how to get through this phase, what\u2019s important is remembering that you have needs. And your needs are as legitimate as Josh\u2019s needs.  And to make sure that all of the things that you need and that help you to feel better don\u2019t get <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">lost in trying to do the things that Josh needs. And I think that because he\u2019s the patient and his health is\u2014physically, the health is a lot more precarious, sometimes what you need gets waitlisted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Actually, I felt really bad about last time, thinking that he wouldn\u2019t want me to go. Or I had to get home. He wouldn\u2019t want me to go running and I couldn\u2019t tell him. Because, I mean, he\u2019s acted that way\u2014well, he\u2014or, he\u2019d acted that way in the past, when he\u2019d been really depressed. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">that\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s resented me, I guess, for doing the things I need to do. He didn\u2019t resent me for going running today, (inaudible at 00:17:49) happy that I would do it. I\u2019m sure he feels all kinds of sad, but he doesn\u2019t tell me that as much anymore.  So, I mean, he\u2014I\u2019m not sure why. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C32\">I was just feeling so worked-up, I guess. I was feeling guilty (inaudible at 00:18:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Ah. That\u2019s, I think, your fear that he\u2019s going to be angry or\u2014and your own guilt for taking care of yourself gets in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not even guilt for taking care of myself. It\u2019s guilt that I should be there, doing what\u2014I forget what I was supposed to be doing last week. Oh, letting his mom go home or\u2014I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But what\u2019s to say that you should do that more than you should have a meal out with your family or take a run or go to yoga or go to work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: (sighs) I don\u2019t know. (sighs) I wasn\u2019t feeling super-rational (chuckles) last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I think all of those things are important. And for you to be able to balance your life, your life continues.  Taking care of him and helping him is part of your life, but it\u2014I don\u2019t think that you can go on for an extended period of time with it being your only focus. I mean, it feels\u2014and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">it hasn\u2019t been. You\u2019ve been struggling really hard to make sure that there is\u2014there are other foci. But it\u2019s going to be kind of a constant need to pay attention to. Are you getting enough of the other stuff so that you can keep doing this?

Well, you\u2019re getting a lot of training.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah. After I finished doing his dressing. Because, I mean, you don\u2019t see very many of his devices in the hospital.  And I\u2019ve probably done it as many times as your average nurse, and (crosstalk at 00:21:04) more at this point (inaudible at 00:21:05). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">I\u2019m just constantly Googling every problem.

You want the information to be able to determine what\u2019s correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Right. And there\u2019s a lot at stake if it\u2019s not correct. Even just his supplements, I had a mismatch med list and I tried to give him 12 (inaudible at 00:21:59) of.  (chuckles) And he stopped me and (crosstalk at 00:22:03) horrified that I could have almost done it.

I was the most obnoxious daughter to my parents, constantly trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">get them stop using plastic. I mean, I just went (chuckles) [a little] (ph) crazy for about a couple years. Until I became I guess cynical about it. But I still felt really strongly that I wanted to work on it.

You were thrown in the middle of it and you have become the\u2014a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">caretaker.

Well, I think it speaks to the level\u2014the lack of, I think, empathy that you felt from a lot of the doctors. Because quite often what you\u2019d come in feeling very frustrated by is feeling like you weren\u2019t really being listened to. And people weren\u2019t really listening to him and believing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201151\">him or understanding what his pain was.

Yeah, because it\u2019s a different perspective.

If you\u2019re getting information that\u2019s making you feel like crap, what\u2019s the\u2014reading that other person\u2019s story, reading those, is not actually changing Josh\u2019s experience. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB1\">So, if it\u2019s making you feel badly . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s making him feel. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a problem that a lot of things that help him do not help me. For example, he\u2019s been watching tragic movies lately. He just watched \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a [tough one] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">CLIENT: Oh, my gosh. But I couldn\u2019t even listen to it.  I just want to read silly, happy things. (chuckles) And he was in tears by the end, because the guy gets everything he wanted after 12 years of suffering. And that gave him hope, I guess. And he felt so uplifted, I think. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">THERAPIST: The same things don\u2019t have to help you. And being able to say if reading those sorts or watching those sorts of inspirational stories is something that he can identify with and gives him hope, fabulous. But if you recognize that, \u201cYou know what? It\u2019s too emotionally draining for you. It doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C31\">put you in a good place.\u201d Giving yourself permission to go, then, that\u2019s when you go for your run.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561835\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C5\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Or you go in your bedroom, put earplugs in, and read a book that\u2019s much more lighthearted. It\u2019s okay for you to gain your strength and get what you need from different places. I think what\u2019s important is recognizing what\u2019s working for you and what\u2019s working for him.  And giving yourself permission <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C71\">to opt out of things. I mean, you don\u2019t [want to] (ph) deny him. If those sorts of movies or stories are really helping him, great. He doesn\u2019t need to be denied that. But you don\u2019t have to watch it next to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C9\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CB\">THERAPIST: And you also don\u2019t have to hear about it, either. If he wants to talk about that movie and process it, there are other people that have seen it. You don\u2019t need to be the person that\u2019s hearing about it if that\u2019s hard for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s where taking care of you comes in as a really important piece, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D1\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019ve been thinking about this a little bit, because we\u2019re pretty disconnected at the moment. I mean, I\u2019m taking care of him, but the things that are helping him are not helping me. We\u2019re doing, I\u2019d say, different things to cope. I guess we don\u2019t have much of a relationship at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3\">And then, when my parents come over, he tells them I do (inaudible at 00:42:56) things. He\u2019s not really telling me, I think because he\u2019s afraid to or\u2014I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D5\">THERAPIST: Do you want him to tell you those things directly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he sometimes does. He was being pretty quiet and seemed pretty down one day. And I forget what I did. If I was a little too forceful or something. And he started crying. And I said a couple of things to him\u2014or, to me. I wish I could remember anything that was said. And then, we <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D71\">talked about it a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D9\">THERAPIST: How did you feel after talking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB\">CLIENT: Well, it was much better. I would much rather he cry and tell me things than just obviously be upset and tell anybody (chuckles) anything. But (sighs) I don\u2019t know. I mean, sometimes, I don\u2019t know if he trusts me, because of my basically year of falling apart.  Which I initially blamed him for. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB1\">And now I don\u2019t. I mean, he kind of saved us from that, but (inaudible at 00:44:10)\u2014I don\u2019t know. (inaudible at 00:44:13) want to ask him if he doesn\u2019t trust me. If he\u2019s brave to tell me things (inaudible at 00:44:18). I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Ask him. I mean, I think so much is off-limits to you as a couple right now. I mean, like you said, you can barely touch him. There\u2019s not any physical intimacy. You can\u2019t go out and you\u2019re not going on dates. But you\u2019re having vastly different experiences in life. And the thing that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD1\">going to bond you is having conversation and knowing\u2014being able to empathize with each other about the experiences that you\u2019re going through right now. And part of that is being able to talk to each other. For him to be able to be open and honest with you and you to be open and honest with him. So, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD2\">when you\u2019re in\u2014when he\u2019s in a fairly good place, when he\u2019s not having major pain, being able to ask him questions and let him know that you do want to hear even the (inaudible at 00:45:09) stuff, then, ask him.  Is he not trusting you? And see if you can have some of those conversations that keep you connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561835\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201DF\">CLIENT: (sighs) I wish I\u2019d asked him about it the other night, when he was (inaudible at 00:45:27).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E1\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s always time.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E9\">THERAPIST: I think sometimes the slight distraction of being in a car, right, because there\u2019s other stuff to look at. So, you can\u2019t face each other. So, it takes away a little bit of that intimacy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB\">CLIENT: Right. Exactly. Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Makes it feel a little bit safer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EF\">CLIENT: Or in bed or anywhere but where we [are now] (ph). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F1\">THERAPIST: The closest you may be able to get to that right now is putting something on TV that\u2019s minimally distracting. So, like a light sitcom or like a home designing show that you don\u2019t really need to follow the plot and be really invested in but can just be on as background noise. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F3\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.

I tried to ask him to do that with me last night.

Yeah. I mean, right now, he\u2019s got two positions that he can be in.

And that\u2019s, I think, where it\u2019s\u2014I mean, and he\u2019s probably going stir crazy, too.  But his physical capacity is actually really different, so if it\u2014you\u2019re having different experience of being cooped up and limited. You\u2019re both limited, but it feels different because of why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I think he\u2014it takes as much energy as it takes me to be really careful all the time, it takes him a lot of energy just to be\u2014not to be calm, exactly, but to not freak out and rip all the tubes out of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021D\">(sighs) So, just like being is so exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really hard.
