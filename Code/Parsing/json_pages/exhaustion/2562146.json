We had an old family friend staying with us. She was only going to come overnight but she got snowed in. It\u2019s really [not fun.] She showed up at the collective restaurant the day I was born. She was a friend of one of the other members and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">had come in from Cape Cod or something.  As my mother tells the story, my father was at the restaurant and my father said, \u201cI just had a baby. I have to go to the hospital,\u201d and handed her the keys. (both laugh) Sounds very plausible. It was interesting. It was really good to see her and she was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">enjoying our household. She had not yet met Rich before.  This is not something I keep track of, but my uncle, the orthodox uncle, is fairly [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:13) \u2013 my only uncle at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: The one in New York?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: No. He\u2019s in Pittsburgh. The one in New York is a first cousin. He\u2019s fairly conscientious and is married to a Catholic. He\u2019s fairly conscientious about announcing the Hebrew liturgy of my father\u2019s Yahrtzeit, which I can never keep track of. He had just had a grandchild, my cousin, who is living <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">in Jordan, in this enclave.  He just had a daughter and so he was flying to Jordan and he sent a message to my sister and mother and I announcing that he was going to say kaddish for my dad on his official Yahrtzeit. My sister sent this message that I found very moving, just saying that it\u2019s been such <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">a wonderful . . . He had two grandchildren this year and my father has had two grandchildren this year. Hilda sent kind of a wistful, very sweet note back saying how she was kind of sad that he didn\u2019t get a chance to meet all these grandchildren and great nephew and nieces.  I don\u2019t know. I found that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">kind of moving. We had a little ritual on the kaddish. We lit a candle and we all said something. (pause) I guess somehow there were a lot of \u2013 not the only connection with this \u2013 but there were a lot of stories about my father surprisingly, all of which were very . . . I mean after several of them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">[Jennie] said, \u201cWow, this really upset me\u201d or \u201cthis really made me mad.\u201d  Even Hilda, who is probably the least conflicted of all of us about my dad, the story she told was about how he used to go and find expired food in the frig and eat it and pretend to have a paroxysm, ptomaine or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Just to kind of gross us out. I don\u2019t really know exactly what he had in mind. Maybe it was intended didactically or he was trying to make a point about not letting food go to waste or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: So the expired food he would find, he would actually eat in front of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: And then he would pretend to have a conniption, which, I guess, at some level was kind of cute. I also remember him picking stuff off the floor and eating raw hamburger.  I don\u2019t know. I remember a lot of good stuff. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: It was not like a sweet, fond memory. And then there was the story of driving across country in three days and refusing to stop to let us go to the bathroom and my mom said, \u201cOh, yeah. I remember that.\u201d She remembered a genuinely sweet story of when we were driving across country in three days <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">and my sister forgot her favorite stuffed animal at a rest stop and he drove back200 miles or whatever. Anyway, it was fairly conflicted. It was unusually conflicted. I think what my mother said was, \u201cWow, we really had a bumpy ride, but I miss you.\u201d  It was funny. It was funny. It was unusually frank. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">It was interesting. (pause) And Veronica mentioned that she had another friend of ours from the same year who talked about the effect that the collective had on me and Eileen and said, \u201cOh, God. It would have been so awful.\u201d I don\u2019t know. (pause) There was something funny about the winnowing away of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">all of the layers of nostalgia and sepia tones.  I think I mentioned last time that my mother had told the story about my dad leaving Jordan to found this collective and she was like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d It was, I guess, a continuation of that theme, and yet [Jennie] certainly had nothing to do with it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">and I really had nothing to do with it. It was all other people, other people who, at least in my presence, have been very (pause) fond \u2013 I don\u2019t think fond is the right word.  I\u2019m struggling for the right way of characterizing things. They were reluctant to imply censure, I guess, or anger or dissatisfaction, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">which I suppose is natural when someone dies, but 17 years later . . . So that was interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562146\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Are all of you sort of maybe suggesting that there is some sort of relief for you or even hearing how it actually was rather than something . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: No, I know how it actually was. I\u2019ve talked, God knows, enough about how it actually was, I think.  I have long since gotten my mother to \u2013 I don\u2019t know if concede is the right word \u2013 but endorse this very minimum conflicted portrait so I don\u2019t feel like I need validation in particular. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">one thing that was interesting or striking to me was that we had this conversation in particular about this and then Veronica came and rather than just being kind of a love fest, I remember such interactions about my dad being . . . you know, she certainly my father is very dear to her and she was much <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">more reluctant than Eileen in the conversation that she reported to kind of endorse the idea that it was so bad for me, but Walter Carr did take me under the car (laughs) while he was [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:10). There was all of this stuff that I kind of had this heart to heart with my mother about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">and I think somehow that was the tambour of the discussions about this. She seemed relieved that our household was so nice and that Grayson was doing so well and that I was doing well and relieved to see me as a father. Maybe that\u2019s what it was. It was relief. It was like I was not a total fuck-up. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200214\">It didn\u2019t really have the effect that people had apparently feared, maybe, when I did not reproduce or have a family or seemed to be kind of settling down for so long.  I can imagine those conversations. So it was interesting. (pause) It was a good visit. Very sweet. [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:40) he was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200215\">particularly cute. He\u2019s great. What is he up to? He\u2019s laughing a lot. He\u2019s laughing a ton. He\u2019s about to roll.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s four months?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Not yet. He\u2019s three-and-a half.  He\u2019s about to roll. He\u2019s about to develop that shit. He\u2019s so locked in. He\u2019s just loving all of the stuff around him \u2013 light and rattly things. I told you we got this book. He loves reading the book. It\u2019s high-contrast pictures. He\u2019s just doing really well. He\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">really progressing and his world is opening up pretty fast. He\u2019s growing a lot. He\u2019s really fat. (laughs) He has just grown a ton in the last three weeks or so, which is nice that it coincided with my mother\u2019s visit.  I got him a pair of Levis at Goodwill and a flannel shirt. It\u2019s very cute. So we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">in the middle of an interesting conversation Tuesday. I was on my way out the door and you said something about working together and I said that it reminded me of this moment in Wilma\u2019s little library at the Oregon State and you said something like, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d (laughs) We hit the slopes.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562146\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t have any trouble remembering that one. (both laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) I remember the moment you\u2019re talking about and I remember being struck, too, by your association to my comment, the implication being that there is something repulsive to you in the same way that the guy on his way up or down the stairs said to the other guy in the library.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Or a woman. I don\u2019t think I remember it was a man or a woman. Repulsive. That\u2019s a very strong word. (pause) It\u2019s a very evocative word. It makes me think of spoiled vegetables in the frig. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Gee. I guess it keeps going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Um. (pause) Yeah. There is something . . . I mean part of it is a kind of caution about psychobabble, I think, or therapy speak or just being too captivated by the process of talking about myself all the time.  It\u2019s what we do and there is specific content there that I think I feel conflicted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">about and so calling it \u201cwork,\u201d well, you know, I\u2019m not working. Something along those lines, but there is also a generic content to it that was the reason for that particular association because those two people were talking in a self-conscious way about their work and I just had this weird reaction <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">or strong or striking or evocative reaction that I thought about a great deal since then, so associating it with your comment seemed meaningful, or at least interesting.  The way I have understood my reaction is that (pause0 there is some kind of (sighs) (pause) aversion now that I try and find the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200313\">right word. I think of the palate of vocabulary that you use to describe a fear of spiders to being endowed that\u2019s related to all of these different environments that I\u2019ve had to inhabit as a kid in such close proximity to each other.  Just kind of be so protean and really not taking on any kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200314\">character was just maladaptive in a weird way, just going from the Trotskyites to the bourgeois household to this religious environment where I\u2019m wearing a yarmulke and just all this stuff, this paraphernalia, to the ghetto.  We talked about this enough, but there is something that made me intensely <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200315\">uncomfortable with being comfortable and being settled somewhere. Just seeing the ease and kind of casual interaction in the professional setting that these people were exhibiting was troubling to me in some profound way. I guess the other piece or scenario or element or whatever that has occurred to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200316\">me about this has been something about the way that my father used work as an excuse to do whatever he wanted.  There is something troubling about his sense of vocation that made me not want to adopt it, either what he wanted me to do or his own sense of commitment to this work that drove him to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200317\">all of these things, or at least to justify all of these things by it. Anyway, God knows. These are two different threads of speculation that I pulled out of the even that seemed analogous, at least, to my reaction to your comment. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562146\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: One thing I\u2019m thinking about is that it related to the relief you were describing a few minutes ago. None of this really applied to you, happily, with being a dad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: [Oh, this is relief?] (ph?) Oh, like the fear of commitment? Or lack of it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yes, like feeling like being stuck in a role for a long time, essentially. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: It\u2019s professional somehow. (pause) I remember feeling it the August that we began working together (laughs), a term I never have used before and probably never will again. (both chuckle) I was feeling it very intensely. I remember having all of these escape fantasies of one kind or another, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200391\">so there\u2019s something there; but, yeah, I feel pretty locked in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And pretty unhappy about it, it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I meant locked in less in the passive sense of the term than in the active sense of the term, the way that Grayson is locked into the high-contrast cow, which [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:40) (both laugh). It\u2019s none of the [ ] in this Catholic philosopher. He wrote beautiful music, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">as well as the philosophical words.  (pause) So that\u2019s true. That\u2019s interesting. What do you make of that? (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m still working on Hildegard. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Okay. What\u2019s the word? (pause) It\u2019s like a stuffed cow. It hangs from his \u2013 what do you call it? It\u2019s like a geodesic dome kind of things with two crossed, flexible poles and you can hang all these toys from it. He reaches for it and grabs it and it has crinkly materials in it.  What\u2019s interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200411\">about Hildegard?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) the first thing that struck me is that it\u2019s like making play out of work and there\u2019s something playful about it that seems so different from how work so often feels for you and how this sense of committed-ness, like what you\u2019re saying about the identities and being with the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">Trotskyites and then being among this religious community \u2013 or in terms of your reaction to the thing on the stairs. There\u2019s no fun in any of that. I\u2019m not saying there couldn\u2019t be, but the way you\u2019re talking about it now, it\u2019s serious and \u2013 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Grim?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, grim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: So my association is (pause) this manner that Jennie really hates that I go into sometimes when I\u2019m talking about something like that or I\u2019m kind of lecturing, it\u2019s like I\u2019m kind of cut off from her, from the person that I\u2019m talking to.  I guess I imagine it to be a little bit sing-song and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">just kind of disconnected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: When you say you\u2019re talking about something like that . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562146\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Like work, like something that\u2019s defined as work, I guess. It\u2019s not engaged. It\u2019s not good. I think I\u2019m aware that this happens and one way I avoid it when I have to give a talk is by writing stuff out.  Anyway, this thing that she complains about sometimes made me think of your comment. Hildegard, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">in my opinion, I know is a writer of beautiful music. There is something true there. There is something right there, even if this particular thing for me is not like a workplace association, but it\u2019s something with fun thing in it. It\u2019s almost, by definition, work related. I kind of get the point even <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">though it\u2019s not necessarily specific to this sense.  (sighs) I\u2019m pretty playful, I think, when I\u2019m sort of writing well and happily on work stuff. I like to make jokes and puns and stuff. But you\u2019re right that it doesn\u2019t feel that way much or most of the time. What does that tell us? Can I interject <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D3\">something completely unrelated? I told you about the three strengths, of which you were the third and you were the [ ] (inaudible at 00:32:48). Something that Grayson loves, and I assume this is probably universal to babies, he loves to have his pants off. He loves to have his legs uncovered.  He likes <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D4\">to have his feet uncovered, too. We were getting nostalgic. I was remembered that I, too, loved to have my feet uncovered, so much so that in class, when I was in elementary school I would get in trouble because I would take my shoes and socks off and I would just sit in the back there. Probably I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D5\">getting in trouble for reading novels or something in whatever class in elementary school. The other thing that they would complain to my parents about was that I took my shoes and socks off; and also that I had my shoes untied all the time. Anyway, it\u2019s interesting that the lack of joy with which I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D6\">talk about and, I guess, I feel anguish about it.  I feel anguish about my unsuccessful, dramatically unsuccessful struggle to find a place in that part of my life, so it seems natural as I think about your comment that it should feel grim somehow. Or maybe not. Maybe it\u2019s weird. Maybe it\u2019s odd. (long <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D7\">pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking about the woman on the stairs and your association in here with that and I think I understood what you said about your thoughts about the woman on the stairs and you sort of explained commitment because of how things changed when you were a kid \u2013 pulled out of one environment <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">and pulled into another one; pulled out of that one and plunked into another one. It was jarring and also because of your dad and his, I guess, in a way his manipulated youth, his commitment to work, in a way.  The sense I had to your response to the woman on the stairs was that you felt this kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">aversion in a kind of visceral way to what the person said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Like [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:50) almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: How they were being. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: I feel like you don\u2019t even have the whole story and what you said about the environment when you were a kid and the changes and your dad was sort of in the direction of a story or inclination, but I guess it would go something like, \u201cWell, feeling committed to something or believing in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">commitment to something gets you in trouble and I\u2019ve had that so thoroughly inculcated into me that when I hear somebody referring to it, I get repulsed and worried.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562146\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Another way of kind of understanding it might be a bit more meta, just like seeing them doing it and I felt this intense anxiety because I don\u2019t have it. It\u2019s a time when I had just come back from Holland and I was trying to set back upon the dissertation as a thing to do and move back to San <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">Diego and was trying to figure out what the next thing was and I didn\u2019t really have a place at the time or a gig or a concept, other than that I have this settled family life that\u2019s wonderful right now. It\u2019s much like it is right now at this moment, so I can imagine just knowing how complicated these <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200592\">emotions are that what I\u2019m interpreting \u2013 or we are at the moment at least interpreting \u2013 as aversion, was more something just like fear, just free-floating anxiety, something that felt like aversion just because aversion and this anxiety touch on the same complex of emotions somehow.  But it was about <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200593\">me. It wasn\u2019t necessarily \u2013 maybe it was a little bit about them. Yeah, that was one of the things that was so curious. It was like \u201cwow, this is silly\u201d or \u201cwow, what trivialities.\u201d Yeah, there was some of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I think I remember you saying as well this sense of \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want that for myself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: Maybe that\u2019s right. Maybe that does make sense, even as there is, again, this kind of protean quality to where I was in my life at the time and where I found myself again to my regret and this kind of trying things on and I saw this thing that they were doing and I don\u2019t know whether it felt <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">too limited or limiting or whatever; but what was striking about the exchange was, indeed, just their familiarity and kind of the regularities of going to work and seeing somebody all the time and sort of talking casually about this thing that they do in this library.  I don\u2019t know if it was the limitation <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D2\">of being the librarian or what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like what you\u2019re talking about is actually wanting to maintain a protean state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the weird thing. On the one hand, it\u2019s giving me pain. I feel pain and I feel this great difficulty and even aversion to somehow assimilating at least the sense of expertise that would come with it. It\u2019s painful for me not to have it, but yet there is an aversion. A classic thing that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200611\">one would come to [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:41) about it, in retrospect, it\u2019s like there is this double bind that I\u2019ve put myself in. (pause) And I don\u2019t know why really. As you say, the story is, at best, just kind of fractional. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: And it seems half of that, in a way, is very straightforward \u2013 like the part about wanting the feeling of expertise and feeling bad or sad that you don\u2019t have it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t need you to tell me that, to explain that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s the other part that . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: But it does really motivate what\u2019s really weird about the other part, or at least a great commitment. It really is the measure of the commitment that I have to this other mysterious, aversive phenomenon that I am so troubled by my commitment to it, that the implications of that commitment are <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">so troubling. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20068-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20068-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562146\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I guess this is the thing that struck us both on Tuesday, is that how that has transferred to this interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think we made any progress in that direction.
