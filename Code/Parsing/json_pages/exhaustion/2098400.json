So how are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Last week was actually pretty terrible. Not for me really but for Josh. He's feeling really dragging lately. Just really tired and I thought he was just kind of down and I don't know, sinking into his own kind of hole of you know, whatever, being upset over things. But it turned out he had developed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">a thyroid problem. So he was cold, he was tired, he was sleeping a lot. All that sort of thing and I was (unintelligible) (laughs). In fact I feel terrible because last week I was and still am really, really tired, I think it's hormones or something, I don't know. I think there was a week I told you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">about that I just watched a lot of TV and read and curl up with chocolate like every day. It's like a month ago. It appears to be a monthly occurrence. So anyway I was really frustrated and tired and especially with him for being so tired but then it turns out he has an under active thyroid. He got <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">a blood test on Friday or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Is this a recent, I mean there's no doubt about it but I think that this is connected (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Oh, no, no. It's because of his medications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It is. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Something that's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Because when I saw you last a couple of weeks ago you were actually quite surprised at how well he was doing given the news that he had been sort of dealing with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, and I thought his behavior given the fact that he does have a heart condition was great. But he was just acting so tired I thought it was just because he was not happy [as yet] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: But he's really hypothyroid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: So I feel bad because he had so much trouble with either a hypochondria or getting people to believe him (chuckles) it's always one or the other like he always thinks that you know he actually was going on and on, he thought this one drug he's on that for his heart rate. It's called Amiodarone <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">and it can cause lung problems. It can cause organ problems of all kinds. It actually is causing the thyroid problem, this particular drug, but he thought he was getting lung problems because it can cause this cough. But he didn't have any of these things and in fact he talked to the doctor about it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">and the doctor said you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, but it turns out there was something wrong -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: which is actually much more reasonable than the lung thing, but it was kind of distracting, not something silly, but not probable. I mean he knew something he just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: That he couldn't really, he couldn't really pinpoint what it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I mean the whole story of his illness is like people either not believing him or trying to be a hypochondriac. It's really tough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: It's really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So yeah, this is really -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And it's hard to continually advocate for yourself in the face of not being believed or -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. Well, and then quite often he does get overly worked up over things that are nothing. Maybe they weren't. I don't know. So, anyway, he's pretty upset about this. Because this is bad news and he can't go off the drug.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: No. So it's adding on another set of drugs on top of -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098400\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean he is cold all the time and now he's freaking out that he's going to gain a ton of weight because he has issues with that because he can't exercise. He's tired because his heart so he sort of thinks he's like deteriorating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Can they give him the typical things they would give you for hypothyroid to balance out his levels or is he kind of stuck?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean, right now he's just waiting to see the doctor again to have a look at (unclear). Unfortunately they called him, the doctor called him with the test results like a Saturday afternoon, so <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: So you just have to sit with these results and not know what you can do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean they said they'll put him on a hypothyroid drug and there's like special things that you do for heart problems. If he goes off the drug it will go away, so they say. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: But he can't go off the drug.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: He can't go off the drugs for right now the hope is that if he's chilled out for like three years the heart will shrink. And the doctor we asked wouldn't give me a straight answer of what the likelihood of that was, and if not, I don't know. It could be a mess. If that doesn't happen he's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">going to be on thyroid drugs and heart drugs and who knows, maybe he'll have lung problems next and this would end up causing like organ failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: That's so scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: It is scary. And I seem to not know what to do about it. So yeah, this week was terrible. I was exhausted. He was exhausted. I was trying to keep him from totally freaking out and I don't know, I haven't told anyone else about the thyroid problem although his mom knows and she seems more concerned <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">than she has in the past, which is good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: At least he has someone else working with you a little bit, if she's reacting in a similar way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm afraid to tell my parents until we know more because I think that they'll just freak out. I don't know what they'll say exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: How are you feeling? Are you freaking out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I'm trying not to. Mostly, I'm so tired and I think it's unrelated to this. But, I'm stressing over that as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: How are you sleeping?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: So much. I'll have crazy dreams every night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: So it's not very restful sleep then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I don't know if I have crazy dreams or if I'm just more anxious because I don't know. I don't know what happens that makes me so tired. I fell asleep on the couch yesterday like (cross talk)  school last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: And you're tired before you're getting your period. You don't have your period yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: No. Well, I should. But like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: You should, but you don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I mean again, my boobs are killing me. I don't know. I had a (unclear) pill. I don't know if maybe the combination of going off the pill is too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Are your breasts tender all the time or is this like, this is build up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: So I think we can pretty reliably say you're period is coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean one week or more every month the exhaustion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Is too intense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: And I didn't deal with it well last week at all because Josh was so tired and I was frustrated like I skipped school half the week and I just disintegrated a little bit. I kept trying, like take the dogs for a jog or something. But it had no effect. Like I would just come home exhausted. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">that was frustrating. I have had several cups of coffee today and (unclear) , so I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098400\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah, to me it sounds like this was a couple of months in a row where it is a pretty consistent pattern, but it feels like even though you know why, it's sort of scary because it does seem there seem to be some signs here that it's all related. It's too intense for you to tolerate every month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I was on this pill for years, so I'm hoping that it will settle, but now it's just a bad combination of events last week. Especially because I don't want to like whine and complain in crisis like complaining that I was mad at him and he turns out having this problem. I've been like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">making fun of him for being so cold because our car broke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I remember you mentioned it when you were skiing that he like couldn't stay outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: I know it sounded reasonable because it was like 10 degrees and he doesn't have much circulation but it was more than that. So yeah, our car broke and we were walking to the movies because the car's in the shop and he couldn't handle walking back to call his mom for a ride home which was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">a half a mile and it was like 20 degrees and then he got like all -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but most people feel miserable but can handle it. I mean it would be logical to be outside in 20-degree weather but it's different for him right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: And he was trying really hard to get us out because I've been we call our couch like the couch of death because it's become this place where we go when we like, we end up (unclear) or something, have way to much time on this couch and (unclear) people. I would go there in the middle of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">night when I would wake up and couldn't sleep. We really need to get off that couch. But anyway, when things stop deteriorating. He was trying to get us off the couch and ended up just like resulting in my crying at the movie theater because he was such a mess. I don't know, I guess I realized how upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">he was and how much of a problem it really was for him. I was like, \u2018can't we please just walk home? I just want to get home. Like I really (unclear) because I hate having his mom pick us up. I don't know. It's just it's not great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it's been really a hard time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And it's weird because I don't even feel anxious about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you feel beaten down. You're worn out from having to cope and having to readjust and readjust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and we always have to keep waiting and waiting and waiting as things gets slowly, painfully worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">(Pause): [00:09:52 00:09:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: And I've tried to like talk to a few people about it because again my friend who (unclear) and don't get great responses. I don't have anyone else, really. This is some stuff to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Is Josh on your insurance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: He's on has his own insurance, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I wonder if he's eligible they're running a group for students with chronic health issues that you may I don't know if he can go as a partner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: That would be interesting. Actually, because all that reading what do you do when you have an under active thyroid?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098400\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: (Unintelligible)  all this stuff and managing stress and I was like (unclear) of course I had talked about taking him to yoga and I can't get him to go and he just feels so crappy. I actually went and it was great. (Laughs) But I can't get him to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I'm glad you were able to take advantage of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: I have a friend who goes every week. Sometimes I go with her. Unfortunately it's high yoga which he's not allowed to go to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: But for your well being they may know what would also be great for him to be able to do something but you also need to focus on how you manage your stress in dealing with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: He just seems to be trapped. He's just trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think a support group of some type would probably be really good for him. Just to have someone else who might understand a little bit of what it's like to go through what he's going through and to face these uncertain diagnoses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, it seems great. He did go to therapy last, the fall that he moved here and he still biked and things. He went for about a month and really hated it. I'm sorry, I tried I talked to him last week about going. He was just out of it saying he didn't need to go. Maybe he does. Maybe he his <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">brain doesn't go round and round like mine does. Maybe he can handle it, but I don't know. It would be nice for me if he would go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: If he could talk to someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: It might help me more than him which is not really fair. So, I'll see, I'll see. I'll bet he can't go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't know if it's open. I saw that it was advertised but I don't know how the rules work about partners. If you were married and on the same insurance I think he would definitely have access, but I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Even if we were married. I don't know, it (ph) doesn't seem to have the same sort of service center that the university does. Or maybe they do and he just doesn't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: You could call there too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I have actually. They don't even have a health clinic like we do.

He could come to the school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Well, give them a call, see if they and if not, see if they know of anything in the area they might recommend, like a hospital that might have some sort of support group or something like that that (unclear) the addition of new complications, some kind of support group for people. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">it doesn't have to be a matching diagnosis, but some kind of chronic illness that needs to be managed because it does seem like that's where he's going to be at least for the next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's just awful because we have no idea. We're at this like some weird place in between being active that drop dead while playing sports that you hear about in the news and like actual heart failure because is this weird thing (unclear)  we didn't but then there's not many patients like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">him. There's nothing out there you can find about what usually happens. What the usual course of things is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: It's not usual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. When you google having a thyroid problem and having a heart problem you get wildly unhelpful stuff.

I don't know anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I think people have no frame of reference, (cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, there's no frame of reference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: You've really been thrown into this world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Oh my gosh, and the doctors I didn't quite realize how if he pushes himself it's making things worse. When we first started dating he was getting over the first diagnosis for the first time and basically everything we did the first year, we shouldn't have done it. Like all the adventures and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">going out to hang out at his friends and going on bike rides with his friends and basically like keeping him sick and so makes the whole beginning of our relationship which was at least the good part, like actually the bad part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: You didn't realize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I never, and neither did he. But it's really obvious in retrospect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You have a lot more information now than you had then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. He didn't have a doctor who was making it really clear what was happening. And I mean, a lot of what they do is they say, \u2018if do you feel good, fine,' regardless of what the tests say. But basically, his heart was enlarged and he continued to push it and push it so it wasn't shrinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">(Pause): [00:15:59 00:16:04]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: So I didn't quite realize that until this past week that that's what had been happening. And that's why there's hope that if he does nothing for a while not nothing but takes it easy for a while, that it will shrink now. It's just such a mess. And it's ironic, too, because I guess one of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">first things he had was the thyroid problem way back when and they never checked his heart at the time, of course, and now he has both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry for both of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">(Pause): [00:16:33 00:16:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Who could you talk to when you say it's hard to talk about and it's scary to talk about, but you need to talk to people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I keep trying to talk to people like right around and people who love me.

It used to.

I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">Like who knows and then that would be awful. So it is crazy, isn't it?

When I first told my college roommate about this she had just been talking to you and that a friend of ours from college who I wasn't friends of but she was because they were in the rode in together, who had gotten married and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">moved with her husband to start a new job for her husband and then he had gotten testicular cancer, I might have told you this I guess this happens to young men from time to time, I don't know. So she had just like gotten off the phone I guess with this girl and I kept thinking about this girl and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F12\">I wished that I was friends with her would love to talk to her about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">(Pause): [00:20:01 00:20:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: I think that's all (unclear) But there are other people I've heard of or know of who aren't close friends but have had things happen to them.

Your experiences are different but they're both really profound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">(Pause): [00:21:10 00:21:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know.

I'll go to school, I'll work hard. But it's just hard, I mean it takes so much energy. Something's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201051\">sapping all my energy. Just the fact that he's there and he's sick is exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because he can't give back to you in the same way that he could when he was healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20106-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20106-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098400\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">CLIENT: Right, but I mean even if I just let him be and try to just do whatever I'm going to do and let him be, it just doesn't work that way, I guess. He's been so much more supportive this time around and hasn't been sort of pulling at me, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Which is also not being fun with him. When he's healthy the relationship feeds you.

In order to really enjoy what it is that you're out doing which the instinct to do that, you do need to take care of yourself and you do need to pursue your own things, too. But yet it's not the same, you going off and having time with your friends knowing he's off having fun with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B1\">his friends is different than knowing he's home and not feeling well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: I mean he's home because he likes to play video games which is what he likes to do, but I know he's also miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">(Pause): [00:23:11 00:23:16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: I mean I know when I'm upset he's worried about it too.

If it's all in my head that's exhaustion or the drugs or combinations of drugs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: It's in your head, it's in your bones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">CLIENT: I was reading about how, I guess, hormonal troubles peak in like your late 20s or something, early 30s or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Oh, I didn't know that actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">CLIENT: I'm sure it's not true.

So I mean it's not just the physical stuff that you're seeing that's related to that. The feeling cold, the feeling tired?

If they can regulate his levels then some of what you're seeing as depression is probably related to the hypothyroid and that's an easier fix.

His mom was telling about that and about his childhood again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: And how it really sticks with you. Your core fears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean his confidence in other parts of himself is like he's [feels clear right now in some way, I'm not sure where's it's happening, but he's really holding on to that other part]. (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: It's like your role can be reminding him of the things that you like about him that are not related to his ability to be active.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: I do, for sure. But then, the minute I go off on a bike ride with some of my friends or go to yoga with the friend he's kind of down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">(Pause): [00:29:09 00:29:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">CLIENT: I mean right now he can't even like walk down the street to the movies and I also don't know like with this thyroid problem -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">THERAPIST: He must feel really trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if he can push that or he just feels crappy, a whole other thing to figure out with what you're supposed to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">THERAPIST: How does it affect your intimacy? Does he have any interest in sex? Can you guys -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">CLIENT: Well, there's been all kinds of problems, but I mean, besides just surgery, one of the they didn't tell him this one of the pills he was on to help his heart, it was supposed to be like a water retention pill that actually they found out is not as effective for beneficial effects on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F1\">heart, they just know nothing about how these drugs work, but whatever, they just give it to him. They didn't tell us it has like estrogenic effects.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2017E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098400\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">CLIENT: And he didn't tell me that for like a few weeks. It was like secret (unclear) than sex which is weird because I think he's all about like make up stuff sort of like if he feels the kind of relationship is like going badly or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">THERAPIST: That's one way to commit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">CLIENT: Actually he has a lot of confidence in himself. If nothing else he feels like he can do the job. So, yeah, it's been bad. Which has been fine up until recently. I don't know why, making him more sad lately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">THERAPIST: Sad that he has no interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">CLIENT: Well no, we're selfish (unclear) (Laughs) I guess that as I feel better and better I wish that I mean it really has been a long, long time now that he's been having multiple unrelated troubles in that area. So the minute we get him off that estrogenic pill and on something else because of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B1\">this I guess insurance won't let you switch until you have side effects or something ridiculous like that, so anyway. And he gets off that and (unclear) and then he gets his thyroid pills. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Which also lowers his libido.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: Yeah. He just has no energy. So yeah, it's bad. Or it's not bad, it's just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: It is. It's a problem; I mean it's okay for that, to feel like that's a problem in the relationship. It is a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: I mean we're super affectionate and we talk about it. He tells me how much he'd really like to.

He just had a lot of, sort of moments where it wouldn't work for him it had to be like a certain time. I'm not explaining this very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">THERAPIST: So if it wasn't how he wanted it could he not actually perform?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">CLIENT: No, he could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">THERAPIST: But he just didn't like it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, or if I would like try to start things he would feel uncomfortable or embarrassed I guess, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Is that continuing?

And I mean, for hormones, not only do they put you on a pill, they put you on things like Zoloft I think, I googled which (inaudible) which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD1\">another reason I was wondering maybe I sleep too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Sometimes an SSRI (ph) can help with some of the signs of premenstrual disorder and so it sounds like what you're having is really exaggerated PMS and I don't know whether you've talked to Linda about it or not, but sometimes they do you SSRI's to help combat some of those effects. It's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF1\">going to change the increase in libido near your period. That's totally normal. That's nature's way of saying, \u2018quick, get pregnant before the cycle's over.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D1\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Whether or not you want to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">CLIENT: No, I have mentioned things related to the pill and we talked about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">THERAPIST: And she says she's shying away from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB\">THERAPIST: I would talk to your (unclear-ologist).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DD\">CLIENT: But then when I talk to them about hormones they're like, \u2018well, you can't really test for it,' or \u2018you can try them pills if you want.'

I don't think there's really an objective way to look at it. But the symptoms that you're describing are certainly something that you're recognizing and experiencing in a patterned way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the most frustrating thing is you google and then like, \u2018eat well and exercise.' And I try not to eat (unclear) and chocolate and try to take my dog for jogs and its just exhausting. Everything's exhausting. And I mean, I don't know if I just kind of like let it go to far. I have things <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E11\">due for school and I have hardly finished them. I just, I don't know, I didn't put up much of a fight I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Well, you've got a lot working against you. You're not just experiencing hormonal shifts. I think it's also partly you know you're doing that in the context of your boyfriend getting his news. Your boyfriend feeling horrible at home. It sounds like your sleep has been interrupted so you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E31\">are depleted of good restorative sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E5\">CLIENT: For sure if you have crazy dreams it means you're sleeping is not ideal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Yes. Because only remember our dreams if we are somewhat aroused during it, so there's lots of different sort of levels of sleep and you don't have to be all the way awake to be sort of out of the deepest sleep waves, the longest sleep waves. So, if you're remembering these crazy dreams that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E71\">means that you are somewhat being aroused out of your good, deep restorative sleep during the night. And if you are remembering multiple crazy dreams then you're probably being awoken to some degree multiple times. And so does that mean you're not sleeping at all? No. I mean you're clearly sleeping, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E72\">but we go through sleep cycles during the night. There are these 90-minute sleep cycles and you keep going through them. If they're interrupted then you're not getting some of the restorative sleep. You are supposed to go through the REM phase, you're supposed to go through a deeper, more restorative <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E73\">phase. So you're getting woken up during them, they're getting interrupted and you're not getting that good restful sleep that you have when you go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning and don't realize anything's happened in between. That's different for your body.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098400\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E9\">CLIENT: I wonder how much more I can relax.

Usually I snap out of it, I mean because it's a pill back down. Usually I snap out of it on a Monday, only it's not working this Monday, maybe tomorrow. But everything happens in weeklong cycles.

You can call Blue Cross and what they'll do is they'll tell you what they've paid for thus far and they're going to be a little bit behind because they haven't probably processed you know, the end of December.

And so you can get a really close <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202231\">gauge from that and just add on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20225\">CLIENT: Yeah, when I used to work and go to any doctor I would still get a statement. You should get something back from them once they've paid me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20227\">THERAPIST: They should be sending you something called an explanation of benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20229\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B\">THERAPIST: You don't get them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022D\">CLIENT: No. Maybe I should get them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022F\">THERAPIST: That's weird. Do you have like an office address at school that you never check your mail at?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20231\">CLIENT: I do, but I wouldn't, I've never given it to anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">THERAPIST: It might be on file with the school though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">CLIENT: That's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">THERAPIST: I've had clients who have been like, \u2018so I just looked in my office at school and there's a thing for November of last year that said,' so you could check that mailbox because that might be what's on file at school and your Blue Cross is through school, so. But that's going to be behind, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202371\">even. So call the member services number on the back of the card or drop in next time you're at the member services office on the first floor and they can tell you everything that Blue Cross is paid thus far. But I'd also do a I'd keep a record on my computer as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">CLIENT: I'm sure I could figure it out, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">THERAPIST: Well, I'll tell you next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">THERAPIST: All right. Let's let you do some deep breathing and relaxation. So close your eyes. Let yourself take some full deep breaths and your natural pace and then please scan your body. Notice any place that feels tight or uncomfortable, mean while breathing into that space with a full deep inhale <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F1\">and then as you exhale let go of the tension that you feel. Let your body relax. Let your mind empty. Notice that your breath will slow down as you let go of the tension letting your inhales be as long as your exhales. Working with your own rhythm whenever you're ready to inhale then squeeze your eyes <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F2\">tightly shut and then when you're ready to exhale you can relax that letting your eyes stay gently closed. On the next breath in you can clench your jaw, squeezing your teeth together and then when you're ready to exhale relax your jaw, let your teeth come apart, let all that tension in your face drain <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F3\">away. On your next breath in shrug your shoulders toward your ears noticing when that brings tension to your neck and your back, then when you're ready to exhale let your shoulders fall and the tension drain out of your arms and your chest and your shoulders. On the next inhale squeeze your hands into <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F4\">tight fists noticing where that brings tension to your hands and your forearms and when you're ready to exhale, let your hands relax, let the tension drip out of your fingers. On the next inhale, bend in your elbows bringing your hands towards your shoulders, noticing where that brings tension to your <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F5\">biceps, hands and shoulders and when you're ready to exhale let your hands fall and the tension drip out of your arms. On your next breath in, squeezing your knees tightly together noticing where this brings tension to your inner thighs and then when you're ready to exhale, let your legs relax, let <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F6\">your knees come apart and let your body relax into the chair. Next breath in, think about tightening your abdominal wall by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Notice where this brings tension to your torso and your hips and when you are ready to exhale, let your belly relax taking full deep breaths.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2023E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098400\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20241\">(Pause): [00:48:28 00:48:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20243\">THERAPIST: On your next breath in, thinking of flexing your feet, pull your toes back up off the floor noticing where this brings tension to your lower legs and when you're ready to exhale let your toes relax, let your feet fall flat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20245\">(Pause): [00:48:48 00:48:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20247\">THERAPIST: On your next breath in reverse that movement by pointing your toes down toward the floor noticing the tension in your calves and your ankles and when you're ready to exhale let your feet relax letting them fall against the floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20249\">(Pause): [00:49:06 00:49:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Continuing to breath at a relaxed pace, scanning your body once again, noticing where you've held onto tension or where it's crept back, thinking about breathing into that space, tightening it even more and as you exhale let go of all the tension letting your body fully relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024D\">(Pause): [00:49:30 00:49:35]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024F\">THERAPIST: On taking a breath to notice what thoughts have crept into your head, acknowledge them without any judgment and as you exhale letting your mind empty for a moment, feeling that other thoughts can come back to you if you need them to, but for now can be empty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20251\">(Pause): [00:49:52 00:50:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20253\">THERAPIST: And let yourself count out a few more breaths letting yourself hold onto the relaxation you've gained as you come back to the room at your own pace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20255\">(Pause): [00:50:10 00:50:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20257\">THERAPIST: Look at your hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20259\">CLIENT: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025B\">THERAPIST: Holding I was just noticing that when you were pretty relaxed your hands were holding on with those fists, so just sometime during the day today, make a fist and let it go because it seems that you were holding a little bit there.
