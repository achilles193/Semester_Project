I\u2019m new to interviews in general, but by phone. And I had read a little bit about how to prepare for a phone interview and that they might ask some trickier questions. So the night before I prepared. Essentially I\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">I mean sometimes it\u2019s easiest if I write stuff down. It\u2019s a lot easier to come up with ideas like why would I be a good fit for the company and what\u2019s my research about and why one would even consider doing my type of research, like what\u2019s the gain And I so I think the interview went well. She\u2026 it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">surprising; she\u2019s a woman. Well, I knew that going in but I found\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re in a pretty male dominated field. [1:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah, I found\u2026 I think I feel more comfortable talking to women, or maybe just more women are [inaudible] maybe I\u2019m slightly more confident around women. But I think the call went well. I felt\u2026 I don\u2019t know if this was a good move or bad move, but I said I was excited to\u2026 I thanked her for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">interview and I said it was exciting talking to a female scientist. And she\u2019s like oh, well, she\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t consider myself a female scientist anymore. Because now she does managerial work. And I said well, you were in the field for quite a while and you\u2019re still a scientist. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">And we were talking slightly about women and sciences and I said it\u2019s nice when there\u2019s other women in science. I said that I was co-chair, and it\u2019s not sort of a scary thing to be a woman in science but it\u2019s just nice to see that there\u2019s other women around and that I think it\u2019s a matter of sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">numbers before things sort of equal out. [2:26] And I felt kind of silly because I shouldn\u2019t be talking about this on the phone during a job interview, but later\u2026 I mean she did say that the company does have some women and that diversity is important to them. And I don\u2019t know why I was talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">women. Maybe that\u2019s sort of off topic. And so I sort of started to regret\u2026 did I make the right decision to talk about women. And so now I\u2019m be-dreading it, like oh, why did I talk about women in physics. I mean it\u2019s on my resume and I guess I, as a woman, I mean [overlapping talk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Well it shows an involvement in the field, I think, a way to highlight some of your activities in addition to what you do for your research. You do kind of want to highlight that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess\u2026 I mean I have done quite a bit of work on it, I mean just sort of gathering women together. I guess I don\u2019t\u2026 I guess I hadn\u2019t seen it as something positive for a company, but in a sense it is. It means that I\u2019m concerned about other workers, the environment within a workplace, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">and so I guess maybe it wasn\u2019t that off base, being a woman in science. And maybe if I were a man and I was talking about women in science it would be different, but I think she got to the real point that\u2026 I mean she made the joke\u2026 she\u2019s like yeah, well, it\u2019s not the old days where we\u2019re huddling together <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">anymore. [3:58] And she just sort of said diversity\u2019s important. And I said good, yeah. I agree. So in a way, maybe, it was\u2026 I see that sometimes when I get too comfortable, sometimes I let my guard down. I get\u2026 but maybe that\u2019s part of an interview, is to sort of see who you are and not just\u2026 she wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">asking me technical\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: You want to work some place where you feel comfortable. And part of that is assuring that there\u2019s a good fit so the company does know you a bit and you get to hear a little bit about what the company\u2026 sort of the feeling of the company, at least, and what the environment is like, not just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">what the work entails.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I did get a different feel than the lab. I\u2026 sorry, I\u2019m looking at my cat sort of\u2026 there\u2019s [inaudible] I wanted her to just try it just because she likes to do it. But yeah, I got a much different feel from the lab and I still\u2026 I sort of saw that after having this job interview. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">she asked for references so I guess that\u2019s a positive, going on to the next step, as opposed to the lab, which just sort of ended at the first interview. [5:18] And I got three people that are really excited to do references, and that was flattering. I just\u2026 I started to get really depressed and sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">of feel like I\u2019m not going to get it at the end. A job interview is such a process and I mean it\u2019s\u2026 just the idea that after these references they\u2019ll probably bring me in. My fianc\u00e9 was saying yeah, they\u2019ll probably bring you in just to see you\u2019re a normal person, ask you more questions and then sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200193\">of set out offers. And so it\u2019s just like oh, another opportunity for me to make a mistake. And I mean I realize\u2026 I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What might be another way to view it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: A chance to get to know the company more. I sort of\u2026 that they\u2026 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It sounds like a slightly more enthusiastic alternative. If you think about it as trying\u2026 an opportunity to make a mistake, it\u2019s a pretty scary thing to go into. But maybe reframing it as an opportunity to demonstrate who you are, an opportunity to get to know the company, opportunity to impress them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s sort of a [inaudible] for me right now at this point. It seems hard to impress anything. And I guess maybe that\u2019s sort of the\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t feel very impressive. I feel like I can do a lot of things and I think I know a lot of knowledge but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Why are those things not feeling impressive? [6:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">C: Well because they still haven\u2019t formed into papers and don\u2019t have any major articles or\u2026 but\u2026 and that\u2019s another thing, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s hard to believe, I mean, for example, the chair, Sherie, I\u2019ve known her for [inaudible] graduate time. And the fact that if she could write something positive it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">like wow, that\u2019s really nice. And then I think well, what have I done. And I\u2019m\u2026 yeah, at some point I\u2019m\u2026 in one sense I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve done, but for some reason she can write a nice one about me. But yeah, in one sense, I guess, I mean when I compare myself to, yeah, the Joe Schmo on the street, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">I can sort of see there\u2019s a difference, but what sort of sets me apart from any other sort of scientist. I mean that, I think, maybe I need to think more about. And [inaudible] I find myself getting\u2026 I see the office of career services at Brown has all these programs like selling your PhD and making <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200253\">the best of yourself or preparing for interviews, and I see they have all these programs and I just need, I don\u2019t know why, I get bitter. And it might just be sort of a passive way of saying I don\u2019t want to leave home. [8:27] And I\u2019ve found that this was starting to get a really bad problem, is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200254\">I get mad when I have to leave home now just because being at home is the norm. And even going for a walk, I mean, mind you, this weather does not make me want to walk, and it might be that I want to stay home just because the weather\u2019s so bad. And\u2026 but going for a walk I was just so grumpy and hostile <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200255\">this Sunday. And I keep on saying I\u2019m going to go to yoga. No, no, no, I\u2019m not going to go to yoga. I don\u2019t feel like it. And then it\u2019s just sort of, yeah, it\u2019s just this sort of hard kind of [inaudible] in my throat, why don\u2019t I want to go out. And even\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: Were you coming from home today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was coming from home today, and that\u2019s why it was\u2026 really sorry if I was a little bit late. It was a little hard to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s what I was wondering because I noticed you have been late the last couple of times, and I know sometimes one of the reasons behind that is you\u2019re having a hard time getting yourself to leave the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I finally got\u2026 I mean\u2026 and in one part it\u2019s my bad schedule because I\u2019ve been going to bed later and later and later, and it\u2019s just my alarm, I don\u2019t know, for some reason I just\u2026 I keep on pushing the limit of when I\u2019ll go to bed. And like I was like okay, I\u2019ll go to bed at two. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D1\">then I start getting ready for bed and then the cats, of course, they\u2019re doing naughty things, so that means that need to be played with and it\u2019s not until three o\u2019clock. And then I don\u2019t fall asleep until four just because\u2026 there was a few days ago that I got to sleep at four. And I get frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D2\">because then I\u2019m like okay, I\u2019m going to wake up early so I can reset my clock, and then I sleep in. [10:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really hard to wake up early if you\u2019re not going to bed until four.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know. Yeah, I really\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 so I mean I think the goal might just to be to go to sleep earlier. I just [inaudible] taking melatonin, taking\u2026 and it\u2019s just\u2026 I think it\u2019s sort of the\u2026 where it starts to get unproductive, this sort of staying up late. And in one sense it was to decompress <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">after Jeremy goes to bed, but I think that maybe\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: It sounds like it\u2019s getting stretched out though, longer than just decompression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because\u2026 and I have all day at home by myself. It\u2019s not like I need to decompress from seeing the world like I did last semester. Even then I went to bed earlier. I think it\u2019s just, in one sense, I don\u2019t like mornings, but it turns out that when I wake up <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">at twelve p.m. there\u2019s still slightly the morning where I\u2019m groggy and want to go back to bed. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: I think the morning is\u2026 what you associate as the morning is really the time after you wake up. It doesn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think it matters what hour it is. But it\u2019s that feeling of starting the day, whenever you start it. And it sounds like your schedule\u2019s gotten so reversed that it\u2019s starting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200371\">to work against you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah, it really is. And I\u2019m starting to miss out on so many things that\u2026 I mean if you go to yoga class at seven o\u2019clock it\u2019s like well then I still have to come home and do some work. And I\u2019m not ready to stop work as opposed to just sort of it being the end of the night. [12:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it would fit a little bit better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so I mean that\u2019s why it\u2019s good that we have this therapy appointment. And also I have racquetball later tonight, so I have to stay here and get used to being gone, which is one of the reasons I planned for therapy to be on Tuesdays because racquetball is also on Tuesdays so I get the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D1\">feeling of being gone. And I might be more productive without the cats, without the sort of\u2026 as much as I love those little buggers they do eventually go to sleep. They do\u2026 I mean every time we get up in the kitchen they go and they want to be fed, and of course I pet them and, I don\u2019t know, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D2\">it just might be sort of being around academics, I think, might be more focusing because I\u2019ve been starting to get really bored with my research again, and I think that\u2019s every day of work. I mean there\u2019s going to be a lot of things that are boring but it\u2019s just sort of something\u2026 and then I was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D3\">oh, maybe I should listen to music or discover new music while I\u2019m doing these boring things. I was like oh, that\u2019s\u2026 yeah, I miss music. I don\u2019t listen to music a lot. I used to all the time when I was in undergrad and I\u2019d study with music, and for some reason I don\u2019t do that. [13:22] Not all the time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D4\">A lot of times I just sort of work with the silence. And I wonder if that\u2019s just because these tasks involve more thinking or whether, yeah, I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026 sometimes I sort of think about how I used to study and how I study now and how does that compare, and I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t always listen <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D5\">to music. Some\u2026 maybe it\u2019s because I stopped listening to so much classical music. And I always used to do classical music when I was studying in undergrad. But maybe not so much. Maybe I don\u2019t need that to focus or to drown out the background sort of means that when I am focused I am and when I\u2019m not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D6\">I\u2019m not. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: How do you find that you\u2019re focusing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Well I find that I can\u2019t be really easily distracted, sort of like I\u2019m\u2026 almost feels like a trance like state when I\u2019m sort of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: How often are you finding that state these days, when you can have that sort of trance like [inaudible] state, in a zone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: In a zone? Usually three times a week. And then I\u2019m usually sort of burnt out and exhausted because normally this trance like state that\u2026 see that\u2019s why I would normally excuse staying up late, is because I would get into a trance and just didn\u2019t want to quit or I had a presentation and things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">start to become coherent again, and you don\u2019t want to quit when the ball\u2019s rolling. And then it just sort of\u2026 it\u2019s hard to get back to a normal schedule like oh, I just stayed up until four a.m. one night, or now I\u2019m just going to stay up until\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you kept a more typical schedule I wonder if you\u2019d be able to enter into that sort of really focused state where you\u2019re getting a lot done more days. [15:49] So it sounds like what you\u2019re finding is you\u2019re hitting that about three days a week, but if when you hit it you then [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">extend the evening and you stay up to those wee hours of the morning, of course you\u2019re exhausted. That\u2019s not\u2026 if you\u2019re doing that there\u2019s no way that you\u2019re going to be able to maintain it. But I wonder if you have a little bit more regularity to your schedule and a little bit more consistent sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200472\">if you\u2019d be able to sort of find a way to kind of get yourself to go to that state more days than not when you work. And yeah, maybe shorter bursts but with the frequency of it training yourself to be able to focus and get a lot done and then shut it down and do it again the next day. And maybe that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200473\">would make up for the fact that you\u2019re skipping [inaudible] one to four hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, and I think that\u2019s, yeah, something that kind of\u2026 I mean I\u2019ve been\u2026 I know\u2026 I think I want to focus on getting back to a regular schedule, and that\u2019s something that I know is going to be a lot of work because that\u2019s not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I know. You can only move your bedtime by a little bit at a time and expect yourself to be able to fall asleep. What you don\u2019t want, what I want to avoid, is having you get to bed and lay there and be uncomfortable because then that\u2019s creating a really negative association. So if you find <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B1\">that when you get into bed at 3:00 that you\u2019re laying awake for an hour, then get in bed at 3:30 and have a successful experience of probably falling asleep a little bit faster. [17:28] Then you can move it a little bit at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it\u2019s interesting, I find that as my\u2026 Jeremy, he always sort of said well, don\u2019t look at your phone before you go to sleep; the blue light\u2019s going to interfere [inaudible] and he tells me that your computer\u2026 I mean I make the joke because he always says that your computer, the blue <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">light interrupts with your melatonin production and\u2026 but first\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Okay. Because I always\u2026 I guess it\u2019s in the morning, I fall asleep by my computer just because I\u2019m tired [overlapping talk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s at night that\u2026 where there\u2019s\u2026 where I\u2019m sitting in a dark room and there\u2019s a bright computer and my\u2026 this probably might be egging me on to stay up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: I mean is it impossible to fall asleep after being exposed to light? No, but there are a number of factors that are conducive to good sleep, and that might interfere with sleep in the opposite direction. So creating the best possible environment for sleep involves low light, or no light, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">the ultimate [inaudible] having a cooler temperature, as free from distracting noises as possible, free from cues that are anxiety provoking. So having your thesis sitting out in your nightstand table, that could be disruptive to your sleep. So anything you can do to try to put those things in place <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200572\">a little bit before bedtime. So shutting down your computer, and if you want to do some\u2026 shutting down your computer [inaudible] an hour before you go to bed. If you still want to do a little bit of work, doing something that you can read on an actual paper is a little bit less distracting. Trying not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200573\">to wrestle with really complicated ideas right before bed because that\u2019s stimulating. [19:31] Or trying to do some\u2026 trying to solve a really hard problem, if you\u2019re not successful, might make you anxious. So trying to avoid things to set yourself up for success before you go to bed, trying to find something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200574\">that\u2019s going to be soothing, maybe reading something for pleasure.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Normally I look on my iPhone, I look at Facebook, I look at little silly things like why things\u2026 cats do what they do, why they scrape on\u2026 after they\u2019re done eating or they\u2019re not hungry, if there\u2019s still food, a lot of them have this innate habit of scraping by where they eat. And at first <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">it sort of looks like oh, cover this stuff up; I don\u2019t want it. But it\u2019s actually they\u2019re doing it because they don\u2019t want predators to know that they\u2019re around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So I mean I think that\u2019s a really common habit in this day and age, where so much of our reading is done and so much of our social connection is done online. And it\u2019s so easy to grab your phone and slip from Facebook to Buzzfeed to whatever. [20:39]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: I have Buzzfeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And so while the content of that, it\u2019s amusing, it\u2019s recreational, it\u2019s light, that\u2019s great. Unfortunately there\u2019s sort of the pull that you get from those devices. First it\u2019s the exposure to light, but it\u2019s also so easy to get wrapped up in clicking one more thing. You don\u2019t even have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">click anymore, right, you just sweep your finger over. It\u2019s very intuitive. And you read one more article or you get sucked into looking at one more person\u2019s profile and the time just goes by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I do that during the day. I get sort of\u2026 I think that might be a sort of a, yeah, I think I might need to start\u2026 there\u2019s this productivity program that I have and it outlaws Internet, and I think I might need to put that on again just because I found that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so easy to get sidetracked by that type of thing. And finding ways to help yourself have habits that feel good longer term rather than the habits that feel good in the moment and sometimes are not matched up. [21:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that might be why\u2026 because I remember from undergrad, before all these sort of devices, and you had a laptop but it had programs\u2026 like Facebook was kind of there but I really wasn\u2019t into Facebook until my last year of college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t nearly as big of a thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">CLIENT: Oh, and I just listened to music and did my work. And of course instead of having\u2026 because I sort of see these sort of amusing articles sort of create the variety and spice of life to the day when research is boring. And I know a lot of people have work\u2026 I mean everyone has work that\u2019s boring, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200691\">but maybe that\u2019s sort of why I don\u2019t feel the need for music, is because I\u2019ve been distracting myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but music can allow you to do both at once whereas these other things don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s also keeping you from [inaudible] so if you go into the office and do work there but then take a break and actually talk to some other people, you get some of that. I think you\u2019re fulfilling some of that need for socialization and for getting ideas from going to these websites. [23:04] <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F1\">But they\u2019re not\u2026 it\u2019s sort of like they\u2019re\u2026 they do, they provide a little bit of that break, but it\u2019s not really fulfilling your need to connect with somebody or to talk about creative ideas in your research. I wonder if your research might feel less boring if you were interacting with other people <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F2\">who could contribute to your ideas, and you could contribute to some of theirs, and that would really\u2026 you\u2019d find more of a community in that type of exchange. But you\u2019re getting a little bit isolated which makes it harder to leave the house, which makes it harder to take that next step.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I\u2026 I mean I think, yeah, this week is sort of a fresh start to things because today I\u2019m here at least until 7:30, 8:00, starting now. So I\u2019m going to be interacting with lots of people. And Wednesday I\u2019m going to have to come in for group meeting and I\u2019ll probably force myself to stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200711\">so that I can be in that atmosphere of academia. And then Thursday I\u2019m also going to have to come in for racquetball, so it doesn\u2019t make sense just to have a two hour round trip. So I\u2019m going to try and get myself in so just at least by coming in three days a week I\u2019ll get used to leaving the house. [24:24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah, make it a little bit more balanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it\u2019s\u2026 yeah it\u2019s crazy just to think that\u2026 I mean and this is why I know academia\u2019s\u2026 what being a grad student has done to me, is that it sort of\u2026 it doesn\u2019t provide that structure that I know I need. It doesn\u2019t really provide accountability, which I know that I need just because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200751\">am lazy. And I work hard but I\u2019m lazy in terms of if I had to go to classes I would just sort of look up the notes online now. And that\u2019s what I did for the lectures for PS2 just because I didn\u2019t want to wake up early or come in and\u2026 but there\u2019s something about being present that keeps you up and up <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200752\">to speed. That\u2019s one thing I sort of have to realize, instead of coming in and being distracted by everyone in the apartment and having to walk places, it\u2019s kind of the natural break that most people are meant to do as opposed to just sort of stay at home and go from the sofa to the couch to the sofa <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200753\">to the kitchen table. [25:41] It\u2019s just one of these things that, I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019ll make Jeremy a lot happier because I think Jeremy worries about me getting to bed late or, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve\u2026 he seems a little distant lately, or that might be because I\u2019ve been grumpy or I\u2019ve been down <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200754\">and depressed or not\u2026 I don\u2019t want to go for walks. And part of that\u2019s just because it\u2019s cold. Actually a big part of that is that I hate this weather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been extraordinarily cold. That does obviously impact mood and how much you want to be out and active.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it\u2019s\u2026 I mean it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m from Florida but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: No, you\u2019ve been here a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">CLIENT: I know but\u2026 I know, I\u2019ve been here for a while but it doesn\u2019t\u2026 you don\u2019t think people ever get adjusted to here but I guess people do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I was born here and I hate it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: But given\u2026 even given that, most people do actually feel better once they\u2019ve over\u2026 get over that hurdle and get out anyway. [26:56] You said you were grumpy on your walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">CLIENT: But it got better when\u2026 midwalk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: Did it? So I think I totally understand the sort of resistance to wanting to get out of your nice warm house. I think you\u2019re facing sort of some of the social anxiety barriers as well as just some of the kind of physical barriers of it\u2019s really cold and you have to wear a lot of layers and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">the sidewalks are icy and it\u2019s a pain in the neck. And\u2026 but on both fronts, when you\u2019ve pushed yourself to confront some of those anxieties you have generally found that you feel better when you are getting a little bit of social interaction and having that movement to your day. So I think seeing if <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200872\">there\u2019s ways that you can make it a little bit more enticing. And clearly you\u2019ve arranged your schedule this week to have good reasons, I mean, to sort of pull you out of the house, and combining those with other things to meet multiple goals. And I think if creating those types of things so that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200873\">do maybe kind of get over that hurdle and either go take a walk or go walk some place. You don\u2019t necessarily need to be out on an hour long walk, but just bundling up and going and taking a 15 minute walk to a coffee shop to work or to go run an errand with Jeremy you might find that there\u2019s actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200874\">some benefit to that, that that makes it worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, I live five minutes from three different coffee shops that\u2026 I mean they don\u2019t offer Internet so that might be a\u2026 or plugs in the wall because that\u2019s sort of their thing. [28:41] They don\u2019t want people sitting there forever. But I\u2019m sure the coffee shop wouldn\u2019t mind taking me as well as <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">the other adults in the adult day care. That\u2019s what someone called it on Yelp, the adult daycare. Yeah, and I keep on\u2026 it\u2019s funny because I keep on\u2026 I know that these things would be good to me\u2026 good for me, I just have a hard time doing it. And that\u2019s sort of one of the things that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: What reward could you offer yourself for doing it, to get yourself started? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: I think I should reward myself with that cappuccino just because normally, I mean, cappuccinos are a little bit more expensive but I really like them, and I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so that\u2019s\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s\u2026 I think that\u2019s a beautiful kind of small, reasonable but objective little reward because it\u2019s a little bit fancier than a coffee you might get yourself anyway, so you know that you\u2019re sort of\u2026 that it is more of a treat. And it\u2019s not over the top. That\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F1\">that you could\u2026 one, you\u2019ve got to go out to go get it. And you can do that a couple of times a week to get yourself\u2026 sort of entice yourself to go do something that\u2019s going to have multiple kind of rewards. [30:06] You get the cappuccino and you get [inaudible] productivity. You get maybe a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F2\">bit of lift that you get from having accomplished a goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: And I think I used to do that with racquetball or sometimes yoga. If I do it in the afternoon, early afternoon, I\u2019d go to an ice cream store just because I really like the ice cream, and how often do you get to swirl two flavors. You can\u2019t do that at home. And I guess, in this cold weather maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">ice cream is not so appetizing, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s heated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, inside. Inside, yeah. But I think I just sort of need to sort of consider it, really ask myself if\u2026 or I think a little bit of a push with the treat but also just to really work on it. I mean it\u2019s sort of like how did I get better with germs and not worrying about it. It didn\u2019t come automatically; <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200951\">I had to work on it. And these things are hard to work on but I think they\u2019re sort of\u2026 it\u2019s the greater good, and I think it\u2019ll be\u2026 getting out of the house and not staying at home, I think it\u2019ll be a really good thing. [31:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561917\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">THERAPIST: The two goals is to move the bedtime back a little bit, a little earlier, and you just keep moving it. And even just if it\u2019s a 15 minute increment and then another 15 minute increment, those will add up. And you have a really good shot at being successful if you move it in those small little <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200971\">chunks. So that goal and the goal of finding ways to entice yourself out of the house a couple of days a week, a few days a week, rewarding yourself when\u2026 as you do it. That\u2019s enough to work on. And doing those two things will really impact a lot of the other stuff that you\u2019re talking about, how you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200972\">feel about yourself. You notice maybe being a little bit cranky with Jeremy. I think if you\u2019re\u2026 if you are able to do those two things, get to bed earlier and more regularly get out up and out, I think you\u2019ll notice that some of that other stuff may fade away. I think it\u2019s connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that\u2019s sort of getting that variety of life.

Let\u2019s see if we can focus on those two specific things this week and see\u2026 let\u2019s see what happens, what hurdles you meet, what things are easy and what things kind of impact other things.
