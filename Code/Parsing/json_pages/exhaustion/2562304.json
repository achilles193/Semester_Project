(pause) It\u2019s a turbulent time. (long pause)  I want to show you [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:04) of my work. (pause) I need to finish something to have enough confidence to keep going. I need to keep going before I finish something \u2013 not just confidence, but energy, interest. Of course, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">I finish lots of things, but none of them is like a bright and shiny stone enough for me.  It\u2019s my decision, but also not enough for Kelly, too. She\u2019s the bright and shiny stone scientist. (pause) It\u2019s like I probably could have finished my PhD by now if I were working with somebody less interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">and if I were less . . . We could play that game all day.  The last 10% of the last bit of what I\u2019m trying to finish feels like the whole thing. It feels like there is the entire rest of it left. It\u2019s technically tedious and I\u2019ve put in a lot of work and it\u2019s not clear that I\u2019m going to get anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">interpretable, so I just end up where I started.  It\u2019s unclear when to stop; it\u2019s unclear how much to try. This is the study that I told you about. [] It\u2019s not clear exactly what I\u2019m looking for. I have a number of ideas.  It\u2019s very hard to prove how much diversity there is in a mixed sample like that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F4\">because the technical limitations sometimes cause you to think that there are multiple strains when there are not because the way that you tell what a strain is involves sequencing and there are sequencing errors and there are errors in the alignment process, like in aligning your sample to the sequence <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F5\">that you got out of your sample to a reference sequence. So it\u2019s sort of a land mine of false positives. There is a sort of tedious way of going into the original sample and check position by position by position in the genome whether or not that sample was originally mixed or the multiple strains look <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F6\">like multiple strains but it\u2019s really false.  There are hundreds of candidate positions and it\u2019s not clear how to choose the ones that you want to look at. Even if you get a result like yes, these are real, no they\u2019re not, you could still be missing some. It\u2019s just really amorphous. It will be clear <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F7\">when to stop if we find something cool, because we\u2019ll find something cool and then we can stop. Or if I get tired [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:05) two options that I see and am getting tired.  (pause) There is other stuff, too. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve been in this place many times with many projects. There is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F8\">other stuff I can\u2019t really figure out what it is. I have two papers that I haven\u2019t written that I\u2019m not working on any more and it could be written.  I have another project that is completely different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:22)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: No, he\u2019s a senior scientist. He\u2019s very cool. He\u2019s in his 60\u2019s and he has been building hemostats for his whole career and nothing really managed to take off for him, so he\u2019s been hopping from lab to lab. He\u2019s so excited. He has all this stuff in his basement and he really, really knows the system. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\"> This part of our lab has been converted into this crazy, mad scientist corner with these big glass carboys bubbling, stirring, the glass is pumping stuff in, pumping stuff out. There are two computer monitors. Part of it is that it\u2019s ancient, so it has that 1950\u2019s, 1960\u2019s and \u201870\u2019s appeal. There is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">stuff flowing into the sink continuously. I spent a long time trying to build it, partly with his help, and we didn\u2019t have enough equipment. And now that he got kicked out of his lab upstairs, we can use all of his equipment. He knows it so well.  That\u2019s an entire project that I just deal with when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">I have time. We\u2019re asking a really cool question. If that ends up being true, that will be a shiny stone. Maybe we\u2019ll put this other project in a less stressful place. I have this undergrad who is wonderful, but she needs a lot of everything. (pause) So it\u2019s a lot of stuff. None of it is [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">at 00:12:01).  It all kind of makes me nervous. I\u2019m not even spending that much time on it. I think I am for myself, but I don\u2019t know. Yesterday I stayed home and worked on a painting all day and I do that a lot. I don\u2019t work nine to five; I just work when I want to and it\u2019s not as many hours as most <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200135\">other people work. I don\u2019t want to work more hours. I want to feel more comfortable working the way I do. But then it gets to these points where it\u2019s like I\u2019m nervous because this thing isn\u2019t really moving forward that fast.  And it\u2019s like if I worked more, it might move forward faster. It\u2019s such a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200136\">corrosive matrix sometimes. Joanne and I call it the matrix. Like the [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:32) matrix when you\u2019re locked in and everybody has their stress face on and they care so much about what people think and they care how much people work and they care how hard you work and they care about lots <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200137\">and lots and lots of stuff, like how many papers you publish and how smart you sound. Blah, blah, blah. It gets really old.  It has an incredible amount of momentum. It\u2019s hard to stay grounded, especially when I\u2019m feeling so vulnerable. (long pause)  What\u2019s been happening here between us is making me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200138\">nervous, too. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20012-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562304\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">How can you matter so much and at times I feel like I know so little about you? (pause) That\u2019s like most of the time. At the best times, I feel like I know all I need to know. There is not a single thing more that I need to know to feel okay about your mattering so much.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like a little bit of a \u201cme\u201d matrix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes. Sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: [It is off balance] (ph?) and there\u2019s something that also feels like it matters a lot that sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel like it needs to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yes, like what I know and what I see and how much I see and what you say to me and how you say it. (pause) Some of it does feel like it should matter and needs to matter, but sometimes it gets wrapped into other stuff and I\u2019m not entirely clear why that other stuff should matter. (pause)  Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">how you treat me and what you say and how you say it, of course that matters. It always does, but sometimes what you say to other people or how you feel about other people, like matrix-y. Or like what you don\u2019t say to anyone but are thinking, that feels like it matters a whole lot.  I know that it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">painful that it matters, I\u2019m not sure that it does matter. (long pause)  Do you think that something that makes the matrix the matrix is future thinking as well? Like when is it going to end? When is it going to change? Is it going to flow more and feel more settled in? I think that\u2019s true about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">word matrix, too, and about the \u201cme\u201d matrix; but of course, they\u2019re both just a matrix. (pause) [Or in the nothing matrix. [00:25:46] (long pause) There is an incredible amount of pain that comes with it, whatever it is. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562304\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I guess I see it maybe a little differently. I sort of think about the matrices as fantasies that don\u2019t feel like fantasies when you\u2019re in them about what\u2019s important, which help protect you from things you\u2019re worried about or that feel bad.  If you\u2019re feeling work isn\u2019t going so well, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F1\">it can start to feel like all that work matrix-y stuff matters a whole lot, I guess, which is kind of like a way to protect yourself. You can just do those things and feel okay instead of work not going as well. Where here, you feel separate or I feel distant from you and if you know x, y, z, you\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F2\">feel better. Maybe something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">CLIENT: Like if I could only know x, y, or z, that [would make it better.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it would assuage the worry or the doubt or frustration that come from feeling far away from me or quite separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: It\u2019s so strange to think of it as protective because it feels like those things cause more pain than the initial thing, like I\u2019m nervous about the amount of work that I have to do to get to some more clearer picture about what\u2019s going on with these patients; and all the work will be to no result. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\"> Thinking about Nelson or Lori\u2019s work, whatever they work, nine or ten hours a day, or that Thomas [] published three papers, or like Kurt\u2019s stuff always works and that\u2019s probably the result of x, y, and z about him that\u2019s not true about me. Thinking about all of those things will make me feel bad, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">but I get what you\u2019re saying about if only I could work more hours or figure out how to be a spinmeister like Thomas is or whatever the things that I feel like I\u2019m lacking. That\u2019s what you mean about protective, like it\u2019s sort of shunting that negative energy into some imaginary . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I had in mind and may be the thing, but that is what I had in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: And here it feels way more complicated. I can\u2019t really think of clean examples like that, but if I could know whether and in what context you\u2019ve thought about having sex with me, if I could just know, then maybe my thoughts and feelings about having sex with you or that we don\u2019t would feel less <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">painful.  It\u2019s sort of protective in the same way, but it\u2019s also painful in the same way because I don\u2019t know those things, so that sucks. I\u2019m left to just imagine. And while, if I never saw you again, I would probably have very, very positive fantasies about what your fantasies are, somehow seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">you and having a real-life relationship with you casts so much doubt on what I imagine to be true and not true.  So if I leave you and it\u2019s somehow easier that distant you that doesn\u2019t want to hear from me is who I\u2019m left with, it\u2019s like if I could just know that you do want to hear from me or if there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200293\">is some indication that I get in touch with you and you were receptive to it, then that makes having a distant version of you less painful.  But it causes so much pain to care or to think at all to wonder whether you want to hear from me. It\u2019s such a painful cycle of thought, so it feels utterly destructive <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200294\">and not protective.  I think you\u2019re right. It does divert my energy away from the thing that is causing the pain in the first place, causing me to think about whether you [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:40). But I don\u2019t know what that is. Some of it is that you just haven\u2019t told me, so that\u2019s not like some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200295\">imaginary you that I\u2019m carrying around. It\u2019s like there is some sort of really simple message that I don\u2019t have from you. Or the message that I have is a simple negative one, which is this isn\u2019t what that is.  I can\u2019t talk about what I want to hear from you because that\u2019s not what this is. This would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200296\">be something different if I could tell you if I were making [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562304\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I think I follow. Maybe I don\u2019t. What I hear you saying is that the message you\u2019re getting from me is that this would be analysis if I would tell you about whether I want to be hearing from you.  It would be something else. And so how does that fare on the question? That\u2019s what I wasn\u2019t clear about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: I was just wondering out loud what is it that I\u2019m protecting myself against? It\u2019s some hard to describe amorphous feeling of distance between us and maybe part of it is that I\u2019m making up some version of you that\u2019s more hostile and oblivious and clinical than the version that I actually know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D1\">and interact with.  But then there is quite a bit of distance in lots of real ways, so . . . yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I think you might be talking about a lot of different kinds of things there. Maybe not, but I think maybe. The sorts of distance that you\u2019re referring to that are really there on one side, the way that I feel distant and oblivious . . .  I\u2019m trying to think; do those actually go together? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">(long pause) No, no, I don\u2019t think they necessarily do. So, for example, if you are, not now, but whenever, like at home, feeling sad or disconnected about something that we\u2019ve talked about and I am not available to talk about it then, then I can see how that is a way in which there is actual distance. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F2\"> In general, you\u2019re not going to call me up and say, \u201cYou know, Jay, why don\u2019t you come on over?\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get some coffee?\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s meet in your office.\u201d \u201cI need to hash this out and now.\u201d There is real distance. I assume that\u2019s the sort of thing you were referring to. \u201cAnd, by the way, what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F3\">this like for you anyway, Jay?\u201d That\u2019s another sort of real distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: I could call you up. There are a lot of different distances there. There is why aren\u2019t I just really being as open as possible about all those moments?  Why am I keeping them to myself? So there is that distance to cross, which I rarely do, but I think about it a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: That is the distance that you introduced?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes. The other part of it is based on what I\u2019m going with, like what I get from you or general common sense, like interpersonal relations kinds of stuff. [ ] (inaudible at 00:44:52) from you. But yes, I\u2019m following some code of conduct that I have or that other people have that I\u2019m following <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">or that you have, but it\u2019s complicated.  So there is some distance that keeps me from getting in touch with you nine million times a day. Then there is the very real distance of what would happen, which I don\u2019t know much about; so it\u2019s scary and unknown and there is some real limit to how much you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200352\">to be engaged with me outside of when we see each other. So those are two distances, is all I\u2019m trying to say. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562304\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20037\">THERAPIST: Right. I think the way you put it there starts to me to get at the distinction, like when you say how much I want to be engaged with you when you\u2019re not here, as opposed to how much I feel is appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20039\">CLIENT: Those aren\u2019t the same thing? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Conceptually, those are completely different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">CLIENT: Sure. I guess the same thing applies to me. Maybe that\u2019s what the first distance is; it wouldn\u2019t feel appropriate to get in touch with you nine million times a day, but I\u2019m fully interested in it. Or I want to be engaged with you that often, even though I\u2019m not acting on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Right. And I think it gets a little blurry for you, as it did I think a minute ago, when it feels like you might get bad news about what I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: I see.  (pause) Even if you wanted to and it weren\u2019t appropriate, those two things being confusingly overlapping or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It feels like rejection. At times, a lot of this, I think, feels to you like I\u2019m rejecting you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, well both things are . . .  \u201cYou think it\u2019s inappropriate and you don\u2019t want to\u201d is rejection and \u201cyou think it\u2019s inappropriate and you want to\u201d is also rejection, though one hurts much less than the other, I suppose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: Or after some point, it\u2019s inappropriate and you don\u2019t know if I want to and it feels like rejection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. I guess that\u2019s most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Which isn\u2019t what it is. It makes all the sense in the world to me that it feels like that. Of course it does, but that\u2019s not actually what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. (pause)  But say you are real Jay; you could just tell me what it\u2019s like and then we could move on. (both laugh) The whole thing is just smothered with rejection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: You\u2019re rejecting me this whole time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: And yet, here you are with me \u2013 you\u2019re smiling; you\u2019re listening. That\u2019s accepting. So if it could just stop mattering, the whole thing could just stop mattering, it would be great, you know?  (pause) But it matters so much. (pause) I have to pee really badly and I\u2019ve also been shivering. I\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">be back.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">[ ] (inaudible at 00:53:26) (pause) Also, your example was like I call you up because I need to hash something out about what we talked about now. It\u2019s only that kind of thing every so often, 10%, are the times I would get in touch with you and feel comfortable. Most of the time, I just want to talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">to you now. That part\u2019s right. There is a lot of wanting you to have a complete picture of what it\u2019s like to be me.  There is not that much confusion or urgent-ness around what comes up here in a direct way. Days like Monday, when I felt like wanting to talk about what came up now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562304\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">THERAPIST: I see. It\u2019s much like this is what\u2019s going on when you\u2019re painting a painting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Or this is what you\u2019re like when you\u2019re just hanging out at your apartment or at work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but like wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you were here? It\u2019s not really informational like that; it\u2019s like sharing. It would be much nicer if you were here and it\u2019s really uncomfortable that you\u2019re not \u2013 or really painful. (pause) A lot of times something will come up that I don\u2019t know about you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">that I really want to know. (sniffles)  Here\u2019s a good example: Michael has a baby brother now. He was born yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">THERAPIST: Wow! That\u2019s big news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes. It is big news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes. Grayson [ ] (inaudible at 00:57:31) was born at 3:41 early Wednesday morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s really cute?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: Do you want to see the picture?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: (sniffles) I want to show you two pictures.

A lot of times \u2013 you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: It\u2019s pretty bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: That looks like a big brother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: There\u2019s a lot of talk about whether he has red hair. That\u2019s the best picture. And this one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Aww, that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold \u2013 soft.  (sniffles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: (laughs) That\u2019s really cute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: His birth has been all sorts of things. It\u2019s been exiting; it\u2019s been me, Jeremy, Jeremy\u2019s parents and Tammy \u2013 a five-person text stream constantly since he was born, which is really nice. (sniffles) It\u2019s brought up a lot of differences for me about our families, about how Tammy and Thomas have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">really changed since the Michael\u2019s birth and since Jack\u2019s birth.  For Michael\u2019s birth, Samantha was there. Thomas\u2019s parents were lined up to be Michael\u2019s caretakers while Tammy finished her PhD. They\u2019re in a different apartment. The whole world just came crashing down and there were months of difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200832\">upheaval for Tammy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: Where are they again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: San Diego. Thomas is a non-tenure track faculty member. Tammy got her PhD in San Diego. So for Michael\u2019s birth there was so much complex turmoil. Of course, there must be for everybody, but Jack\u2019s birth is like no parents are invited, there is no question on who is going to take care of Jack <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">when he\u2019s young or during his childhood.  Tammy is pretty set on continuing to stay home. There is no conflict about getting back to something else, except Michael, which it seems like is hugely difficult. Wednesday was the first night Tammy has ever spent with Michael. There is also a ton of space. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">Tammy\u2019s parents are really respecting the space, but I can tell that it\u2019s so hard. My mom picked up a phone to call Tammy yesterday when Tammy didn\u2019t tell Jeremy that she was having contractions. Tammy didn\u2019t tell Jeremy anything until Jack was born.  Samantha knew that she was having contractions 12 <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200873\">hours before and didn\u2019t tell Jeremy. Jeremy was very hurt. Samantha felt really bad knowing that Jeremy was hurt, but said \u201cit wasn\u2019t my muse to tell.\u201d That is such a strange thing to hear for me because it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like, but I can imagine from what I know about my family. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200874\">It\u2019s like \u201cHey! Hey!\u201d  If my entire family isn\u2019t there already, it\u2019s not my muse. It\u2019s the whole world\u2019s muse. I don\u2019t possess this baby. I\u2019m not the owner of this baby. It\u2019s a gift to the world. There is something very serious there, but then there is also something very funny. It\u2019s almost like there <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200875\">is just no space. There is zero space. A good example is Tammy would not let Jack be bathed for 12 hours until yesterday afternoon. He spent the entire time on her chest from 3:40 AM until 3:30 PM and he got bathed and he got right back on and that\u2019s where he\u2019s been the whole time.  She hasn\u2019t put him <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200876\">down to sleep. She hasn\u2019t put him down for him to sleep or to eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562304\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: A little reserved parking space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) Which I guess feels so good. Anyway, it\u2019s brought up a lot of stuff. It\u2019s been very exciting and very evocative. But here I am hearing about the news. We got to talk to Tammy for a couple of minutes yesterday on the phone and she said they got to the hospital at 11:00 PM. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">such a short labor. She said she spent most of the time in the shower. She didn\u2019t want to be sitting down at all. She was in the shower and walking around, bending, doing whatever.  Thomas was in there with the nozzle pointed right on her lower back or on a couple of other places that were really feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B2\">really bad. All I could think about was you pointing the shower nozzle at somebody\u2019s lower back, like maybe your wife\u2019s, maybe mine. I have so many questions for you about today and yesterday, in particular. This isn\u2019t the first time these questions have come up. How old was your oldest when [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B3\">at 01:05:52)? How much time did you take off and did you tell your patients?  Who else was there for you? And did you cry? Were you nice to have around or were you kind of not great to have around? I think it was really hard for Thomas the first time and the second time he was incredible. He was so <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B4\">incredible. It\u2019s this weird (pause) wanting to share with you and missing you and being upset that I don\u2019t know these things about you and that I can\u2019t call you and ask you.  It\u2019s also a weird way of processing new things in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You think you feel hurt like Jeremy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: (crying) Yes. Something really exciting was starting to happen and no one told him. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: In a way, it\u2019s worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: It\u2019s much worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: Because the way you know being closeness is in your family there is none of that bullshit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: People don\u2019t care about your space and it\u2019s so nice.  Now that I\u2019m seeing the nice things about it and the bad things about it, I realize how insulating and warm it has been for me and how [ ] (inaudible at 01:08:31) and cold I feel all the time. It\u2019s like sometimes it feels like it\u2019s simply <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">a result of the relative change. (pause)  It\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t process new information without pulling you into it. It\u2019s very intense and invasive and is also a sort of wistful and sweet way, but the lack of things was so much stronger at that moment and it always is, like this is what happens nine <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200972\">million times a day, this sort of \u2013 I don\u2019t know. What would you call it?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562304\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">THERAPIST: Longing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">CLIENT: Imagining you in the shower with the shower nozzle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 01:10:14)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">CLIENT: Why is it there? (pause) Does it make sense how it is and how much it\u2019s there? (sniffles) How invasive it feels? (pause)  Invasive is tricky because it only feels invasive when I respond to it with a lot of sadness, but sometimes I respond to it with a pleasant, curious, sweet longing that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F1\">can just hold. I don\u2019t really mean invasive all the time, but most of the time in me maybe. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yes. (pause) It does because I feel like what\u2019s happening with me, how you\u2019re feeling, is, because of the way things are, something that is more intense with me and jumps way out into relief with me, but that you feel aversion of all over the place \u2013 with a lot of people and situations and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A11\">things \u2013 but that you manage in ways that keep it less intense, more [ ] (inaudible at 01:14:31), and mixed with other things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: Do you have anything in mind at the moment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Examples of that?  The way you describe falling in love with a lot of people, growing up and in your present life, and harvesting people and taking control of social situations, activities that you get into and make your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">CLIENT: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Painting and meditating and playing music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">CLIENT: The ways you describe all of these things and the way that you\u2019re talking about them right now have to do with the longing and the harvesting and [the intent.] (ph?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I think so. In a way, I guess what I\u2019m doing is relating it to other things in your life, but I\u2019m actually not, it occurs to me, really explaining anything.
