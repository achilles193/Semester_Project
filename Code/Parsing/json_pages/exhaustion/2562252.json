(pause) So, I was really uncomfortable yesterday with you saying that you were wrong, and I\u2019m not totally clear on why, so I thought I would bring it up. Yeah, I feel like I freaked out a little bit, and I don\u2019t know why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (pause)  As I recall, (pause) I had first been talking about this parallel where you seemed to kind of feel unsafe, both with your dad and with me, and I was saying I thought that, in a way, in the present day, it seems like that had more to with you than an actual danger, or likely <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">danger. And then, as we talked more, there was something that made me kind of revise that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Um-hum. I think we were talking about my dad trying to make a joke, (inaudible at 00:01:50) when I was a kid. (inaudible) Both of us, at the same time, were like, \u201cNope, not so much something to joke about right now.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right, I guess, then how you made it clear to me that that actually was just the sort of thing you found hurtful, and you were afraid of happening. I think that was when I said I was sort of wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Um-hum. (pause) Yeah, and I don\u2019t know; it sort of threw me.  I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s not that I necessarily disagreed with you. Yeah, I do think that it has a lot to do with me, but it\u2019s not entirely coming from me, if that makes sense. Being afraid is. (pause) In part, people say things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">are hurtful unintentionally when part I think it is\u2026 In some ways, because I think it was like, the call (ph) didn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t hurt me that much. It was like, \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t okay,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t that painful. I think part of it is coming from a memory of being \u2013 of things like that hurting me much <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">more than they currently do, if that makes sense.  But, I don\u2019t know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I think, also, what I had said immediately before was some reference to things being pretty bad for me right now, or right then, and (pause) it felt like you were trying to shift attention away from that, and that (pause) did not feel good. (sniffle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh. I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: At least, that\u2019s what I think was happening. It wasn\u2019t something that I formulated in my head at the time. It\u2019s more like reconstructing afterward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Hmm, I see. (pause)  It seems to have been what disturbed you was the sense that I was wanting to move away from your feeling really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I think, in part. Yeah, I think that\u2019s part of it. I mean, I think part of it is I\u2019m just uncomfortable with you being wrong. (laughter) I don\u2019t know what to do with that. (pause)  I am uncomfortable with you saying that you are wrong in that particular situation because I\u2019m not uncomfortable <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">telling you that I think you\u2019re wrong. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: (laughter) [Hasn\u2019t happened yet] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: (laughter) At least, not most of the time, so yeah, I don\u2019t know what to make of that. (pause 00:07:35 \u2013 00:08:38)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I went back and slept for another three hours yesterday. I think that helped. It was hard to remember that I can\u2019t miss sleep. It\u2019s not good for me, but I just need to be disciplined about that. And it\u2019s hard, also, not to make that kind of self-care something else that I beat myself up about.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562252\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It also seems like it was hard to tell me how upset you were by what happened yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m pretty exhausted now. (laughter)  You\u2019re like, \u201cWell, got that out of the way. What are we going to do with the next 40 minutes?\u201d (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re feeling pretty cooked (ph) after that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Little bit. (pause) Yeah, it\u2019s hard. For some reason, telling you that I think that you\u2019re wrong \u2013 like, that your ideas are wrong \u2013 is not the same thing as criticizing you, in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: And the former is okay, and the latter is really hard for me to do. It\u2019s hard for me to trust that you\u2019re going to understand what I mean and, also, that you\u2019re going to respond well to it.  It\u2019s hard for me to trust that when I say like, \u201cThis thing that you said had unintended consequences <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">for me, that were hurtful,\u201d\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: That I\u2019m not hearing, \u201cWow, Chad (ph), you really fucked that up.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Not even that, that you\u2019re not hearing, \u201cWow, Chad, you\u2019re a really terrible person.\u201d (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Ah, I see how that (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: (laughter) So, yeah, I guess I just feel like the stakes are very high here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Um.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">(pause 00:11:32 \u2013 00:12:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: And I would hear, \u201cI\u2019m a terrible person,\u201d along the lines of being very cruel or insensitive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I guess so, yeah. (pause) So then I feel like what I imagine will happen is that either you will say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a terrible person, so obviously, I can\u2019t have done anything wrong at all,\u201d or you\u2019ll say, \u201cI did this wrong, and I am a terrible person,\u201d and then sort of flagellate yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">until I have to step in and make you feel better about it and tell you, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really okay. You didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really feel good about either of those things. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Certainly, both involve a kind of a bring-down (ph), in a way, between you and me, over what you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) With most people, when I need to confront them about things that were hurtful, I have to do the calculation of, \u201cIs this a big enough deal that I have to say something? Is that rift already there, or is it something that I can sort of deal with on my own?\u201d [00:14:10 ]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(pause) I\u2019m getting better at sort of defending myself, and when the problem is already there, I\u2019m getting better at recognizing that I\u2019m just acknowledging that this is a big deal for me, rather than making something that wasn\u2019t a big deal into a big deal. This is sort of a hypothetical situation with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">other people. But I don\u2019t know; it almost feels like everything is going to become a big deal, whether it was or was not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see. Right, whereas, the previous (inaudible at 00:15:07) that you might have been to, in a way, kind of minimize how big a deal something was, by attributing that you were just making a mountain out of a molehill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Um-hum. (pause) Yeah, when you say \u201cprevious\u201d\u2026 (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Okay. Fair enough. (laughter) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I\u2019m working on it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: No, that makes a lot of sense. I guess, honestly, I probably didn\u2019t have the idea so much that it was over. Instead, I was just trying to be clear what I was referring to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562252\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a good point that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">(pause 00:16:11 \u2013 00:17:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Maybe the (pause) worry you mentioned in telling me that what I said yesterday really upset you, or bothered you, kind of reiterates what happened in the first place. In other words, if you tell me what I said really disturbed you, you\u2019re worried I\u2019m going to feel like a terrible person. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">And then things are kind of going to fall apart, in the sense that, either I\u2019m going to just brush aside what happened to you, or I\u2019m going to get so absorbed in it that you\u2019ve then got to abandon what you were talking about and shore me up, in a way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">I guess, I wonder if that\u2019s maybe something you were worried about when I said I was wrong yesterday, that I was feeling \u2013 or would feel \u2013 really terrible from having \u2013 for some reason, that thing, as opposed to any number of other things I get wrong. Somehow, I guess, it felt more self-critical than <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">conceptual, or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. (pause)  I think \u2013 I also think that part of my fear of bringing it up today is it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, which sort of makes it much harder to bring up. Because if it was very hurtful to me, I\u2019m already very hurt, and so there\u2019s not as much risk to things blowing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">up with you. But because it was sort of a comparatively small thing, then it\u2019s harder to talk to you about it because I feel like it might turn into a big thing, and then that\u2019ll be on me. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Um\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: But sort of the way that you\u2019re describing it was that I was very hurt by this, and I think that\u2019s not totally accurate. I think I was a little bit hurt by it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Got you. It sort of feels like (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: But I would be very hurt if you sort of read \u201cI\u2019m a terrible person,\u201d into this, and either blew up at me about it or blew up at yourself, and that I had to resolve that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Right, it was sort of like doubling down or tripling down on your way out the door yesterday, which wasn\u2019t so big, actually, yesterday but could blow up. The thing that you said that kind of jumped out at me was, \u201cAnd it would be on you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I really believe that. I know it\u2019s not true, but I really believe it. (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess so. And, also, I don\u2019t know; somehow it seems relevant to me that that\u2019s a crucial \u2013 the issue of fault is just really looming large.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Um-hum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And whether it\u2019s me feeling more or less intensely at fault \u2013 or you, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Um-hum.

I have a sense of like \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 with me hurting you, it\u2019s more like I feel guilty in a way that I just couldn\u2019t handle.

In other words, you feel so bad in yourself about having done something or not done something. Whereas shame, I guess I sort of imagine more as feeling like you looked really bad in somebody else\u2019s eyes for having <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">done something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Mmm.

(crying)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">(pause 00:27:58 \u2013 00:28:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Okay, I sort of lost track of what we were talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Well, tell me what\u2019s on your mind, if anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like I\u2019m trying to think about this, and I sort of go off in various other directions instead \u2013 but other directions that are like\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">So this is sort of embarrassing, but I\u2019ve been playing a lot of Candy Crush on my phone, and I have visions of the little jewels, so like that sort of clutter. (pause)  Not on my cell phone, my Kindle. I don\u2019t have a smart phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Sounds better than what we were talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, it\u2019s very soothing. (pause, crying 00:30:03 \u2013 00:31:53)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">I\u2019ll just get all\u2026 (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">I just got all the tissues. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Do you need some more? There\u2019s some\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: No, there\u2019s still more in there. I cried (ph) more than I expected today. (pause, sniffling 00:32:05 \u2013 00:32:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">Who knew? I\u2019m really scared to talk about this. But I want to keep talking about it, but it\u2019s sort of managing my fear and talking about it at the same time is hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">(pause 00:33:13 \u2013 00:33:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m just frustrated with myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Um-hum. (pause) Candy Crush is a little like Tetris?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, or like Jewel, if you\u2019ve played that. It\u2019s basically like Tetris, yeah. (pause) It\u2019s like slightly more strategy, but not very much more strategy. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">When you were talking about guilt yesterday, I was thinking about it, and it\u2019s like both of my parents, especially my mom, they just feel so bad about themselves all the time. I just feel so guilty, and yeah, I end up caring for them. Nobody saw that coming. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:35:52)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">(background noise)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">I think with me, you\u2019re (pause) sort of working to and very anxious about putting it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">(pause 00:36:35 \u2013 00:38:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I guess another something that I also imagine feels similar with me and with your parents, especially when you were younger, is the feeling that you\u2019re more dependent. You need me or them in a way that we don\u2019t need you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: I imagine is how it felt, so if I can\u2019t deal with something, or they can\u2019t, you\u2019re going to pay the tab.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: In order to keep things going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">(pause 00:38:44 \u2013 00:40:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m also remembering back a little bit to yesterday, and I don\u2019t remember (inaudible) we were saying, but I do remember, I think, before revising my view of what happened with your dad and also my thought about being wrong in what I said \u2013 I remember being surprised somebody had really upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">you (pause) in a way that I hadn\u2019t kind of expected or didn\u2019t understand, I think, made me sort of rethink, like, \u201cHuh, maybe I \u2013 I see to have missed something here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562252\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And wonder, sort of, if that was what it was, what I then went onto say and kind of revise.
