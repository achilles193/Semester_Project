And she convinced me to try more Zoloft. [chuckles] And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really helping but it feels like it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, you were on\u2014we actually\u2014we\u2019ve been trading messages back and forth \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: giving each other nuggets of information instead of having an actual conversation. I\u2019m trying. One of the things I mentioned was that you seemed to be vibrating with anxiety two weeks ago, I think was \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: the worst of it, in terms of when I was seeing you. I don\u2019t know what happens in between. And she mentioned that you were on a really low dose of Zoloft. And that maybe going up a little bit might be something helped just bring down the constant buzz that was happening for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Well (ph), I was telling her how tired I was. And for some reason, the last time she tried to up it, I don\u2019t know, it was making me feel a little jazzed. Maybe I just drank too much coffee at the time. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Well, you were also\u2014I mean, you\u2019re in a different place \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: and what you\u2019re dealing with changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. And I\u2019m not sure I gave it a fair shot before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Well, I know you\u2019re often very hesitant about the meds. We want to respect, but we also want to make sure\u2014I guess\u2014I can\u2019t make recommendations about the medication, but I can report what I see. And I want to respect your hesitation to not be on a lot of medication. But we also want to just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">get you whatever types of support you need right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, well, I hadn\u2019t been taking it\u2014well, in the morning, every time I take it in the morning, which is when I usually can remember to take it; it usually hurts my stomach a little bit.  I feel like I need to eat more. And so, I told her that. She\u2019s like, \u201cJust take it in the afternoon. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">Set an alarm. Bring it with you.\u201d And I (crosstalk at 00:02:14) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. That\u2019s (inaudible at 00:02:15).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Just have been feeling like I didn\u2019t want to take it anyway, so I wasn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why it (crosstalk at 00:02:21).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Mmm. So it hadn\u2019t been super consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean, I\u2019ve been consistently taking it in the mornings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Even though it was upsetting your stomach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I was doing. But anyway, so, taking it in the afternoon works better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: And I seem to have more energy in the afternoons. I don\u2019t know if that\u2014I know it takes a while for it to build up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: But you already have a baseline in your system, so I\u2014it\u2019s not the same as starting from scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Okay. I don\u2019t want to get too excited but it seems to be helping (inaudible at 00:02:51).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re allowed to enjoy feeling a little bit better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: [chuckles] Yeah, sometimes, now, I have more energy in a good way in the afternoons.  It\u2019s been nice. I know we talked a little bit about Josh last time. And things haven\u2019t really gotten better with him [chuckles] in any way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561843\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s really just because he\u2019s in\u2014he has back pain. I think I told you last time. That hasn\u2019t\u2014we haven\u2019t been able to fix yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Find a way to control that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: And, I mean, it just makes him completely unable to do anything, so, yeah (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s it like for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: It\u2019s awful. Because I left last time really wanting to set up some sort of time we could have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so that you could actually connect with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, I\u2014he\u2019s been a little bit better to hug. [chuckles] Do stuff like that. But I tried to\u2014because we used to have date night on Saturday nights.  So I tried to actually sit at the dinner table with him and eat dinner, but he was having back spasms trying to sit in the chair and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">eat. So, I don\u2019t know, it was a disaster. [chuckles] Every time I \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Makes you feel like time\u2014I mean, you don\u2019t get what you were hoping, to have a time when you can actually connect with him. And it\u2019s hard to see him be in pain, I would imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well, he felt really bad. (inaudible at 00:04:29) We had managed to make dinner. And then, we tried to sit down and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Mmm. And he can\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he couldn\u2019t sit there. And, I mean, he\u2019s sitting there, not just in pain but freaking out. He said it\u2019s so bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:04:44)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t even imagine. And then, also, yeah, and I\u2019m really hoping when he got\u2014came home that we\u2019d be able to spend time together \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (crosstalk at 00:04:54)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: enjoying that he was home. But every time I got a little bit upset, an hour, maybe, in the morning, where he was\u2014it was a little bit normal.  Then he would suddenly have back pain. So, it\u2019s really taken away our times to be (inaudible at 00:05:12) normal. [chuckles] He can\u2019t get in a car. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">I can\u2019t get him to go outside. It\u2019s a really big problem. So, I mean, we\u2019ve got all kinds of drugs. We have a massage therapist come. He\u2019s got physical therapy coming. I don\u2019t know. I guess I hope it\u2019ll work out eventually, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah (ph), it sounds like it\u2019s really hard to control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know what\u2014we don\u2019t really know exactly what cause it is. Crazy amounts of drugs (inaudible at 00:05:40). [chuckles] Just not good. So, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, very frustrating from a medical standpoint of trying to figure out how to help him. But also really frustrating in terms of your relationship, because without pain being under control, you don\u2019t really have access to your boyfriend at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s weird. (inaudible at 00:06:05) quickly can just become\u2014I can\u2019t see (inaudible at 00:06:07) the middle ground between being really stressed and having to separate myself. Which, I guess, almost becomes\u2014I start to feel depressed, I guess. [chuckles] Like last night, he was finally <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">feeling a little better and he wanted to sit on the couch and watch some TV with me and be a little bit of normal. But he had spent the past three hours previous sleeping off some pain drugs he took because he was having really terrible back pain. I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard for you to slip into, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to sit down and have the Oscar party now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561843\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, kind of. I don\u2019t know, my brother had been over and I\u2019ve been hanging out with my brother. Chatting for those three hours while he was fast asleep on the couch. And I don\u2019t know, I guess I was\u2014I felt so separate.  I don\u2019t know. [sighs] God, and the minute he starts having back pain, he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">needs me to take care of him. Get him drugs, get him a heating pad, give him a back massage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to slip from one role into the next. Or having some regular life of your own. Caretaking and then trying to be a girlfriend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah. [chuckles] I don\u2019t know. He seems to be keeping up decent spirits about it, I think. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s putting it on or putting that on for me, but\u2014I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: How are your spirits?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, not too terrible, I guess, because it felt just more\u2014I\u2019ve separated the moment when I take care of him. Even though he\u2019s home. I mean, he knows we\u2019ll be at the hospital, because it\u2019s \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re probably actually doing more caretaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that has gotten better as he\u2019s figured out stuff that he can do himself.  So, I don\u2019t feel so exhausted by it all. Also, I mean, last Tuesday, because I saw you on Monday. Last Tuesday, we had gone to the hospital for his weekly check-up. And the infectious disease people had come <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">in to see him. And I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d never met them before or\u2014they didn\u2019t know much about the whole transplant business or just the infection. And they were asking his transplant nurse if he\u2019d been listed. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s been listed for a month,\u201d or whatever. And they said, \u201cAnd how <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F2\">long do you think he\u2019ll be listed for?\u201d And she said, \u201cIt could be a year.\u201d And I think I told we\u2019ve been dreaming about our wedding in October.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:08:42) months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. We really have been like, \u201cIt\u2019s got to happen by the summer.\u201d That\u2019ll be like six months. Be just a good time to start really hoping. And they\u2019re pretty pessimistic, the transplant nurses. But they\u2019re usually bright. They knew (crosstalk at 00:08:58) infection (inaudible at 00:08:59). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: So hearing \u201ca year,\u201d and thinking that\u2019s probably realistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that really killed our spirits last week, a lot. [chuckles] It was pretty sad. To have to be like, \u201cOkay, it could actually be a year.\u201d Because, also, I mean, I think I told you, he\u2019s been sleeping on the couch because he didn\u2019t want to ruin our relationship. We\u2019ve had several conversations <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">about that. He\u2019s still sleeping on the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounded like that was actually a somewhat good plan for you, sleeping separately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s really sad. (inaudible at 00:09:34) him sleeping on the couch for a year. [chuckles] It\u2019s terrible. He won\u2019t even come into the bedroom because it makes him sad. In fact, he actually tried to go into the bedroom and we realized his device couldn\u2019t fit through all the (inaudible at <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">00:09:51). [chuckles] Because we hadn\u2019t actually tried to rearrange it because he hadn\u2019t really been (inaudible at 00:09:55). That was really bad.

It\u2019s hard to get these doses of reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yes.

You don\u2019t maybe need to think in terms of a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:10:22), yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re never going to really know exactly when that\u2019s going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That was really crushing last week. I think we\u2019re just not thinking about it at the moment. But things aren\u2019t day by day crises anymore. Just about all his pain and whatever. So we have to come up with some kind of (crosstalk at 00:10:38).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Something in between day by day crisis and planning a year ahead. There\u2019s lot of room in between there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean, anxiety-wise? At some point, I want to be feeling okay (inaudible at 00:10:55) keep us separate. It\u2019s just sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Right. Because it\u2019s a big loss.  So there\u2019s something to be gained in keeping yourself a little bit detached and seeing your separate life. But there\u2019s a lot to be lost in having to maintain that distance from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, (inaudible at 00:11:18) if it\u2019s a sustainable way to be. It\u2019s working this week, at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Even if it\u2019s sustainable, which it might be, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s certainly not what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Well [chuckles] yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: And I wonder if it\u2019s possible to plan for something that has some semblance of what you want. I mean, no, you\u2019re not going to get your ideal. But maybe, like you said, some sort of a life, some sort of connection where you feel like you\u2019re actually dating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: [chuckles] Well, I mean, that can\u2019t happen until his pain is under control, because it\u2019s just so debilitating.  And when that will be and how that will happen, I have no idea. So, I don\u2019t know. Have to put it on hold, I guess. We\u2019re going to the doctor\u2019s again tomorrow. Beg for some more options, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And getting creative. Like you tried to have dinner at the table, which would have been really nice. To be able to sit across from each other and share a meal. Are there more creative solutions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: And getting creative is the only way that you\u2019re going to get a little bit of feeling like you\u2019re actually having a relationship. Because, right, the traditional modes of connecting, you\u2019re not going on date nights. It sounds like even planning for dinner at home at the table is hard. You\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">talked about it\u2019s really hard to even find a way to touch him that\u2019s not going to hurt him, so sex is out the window.  And getting creative about, well, how do you have some physical connection that feels warm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess it\u2019s hard to even accept any of it. Even if we\u2019re just sitting on the couch, because at any minute, he\u2019s going to start \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It could be \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: freaking out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Which would just then be so sad and upsetting, if I was just trying to relax and be okay (crosstalk at 00:13:28).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: If you put your guard down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, I don\u2019t know. I guess this is where I just become\u2014I don\u2019t know. It just feels really depressing if I\u2019m not anxious about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561843\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. So the anxiety protects you from thinking about missing out\u2014on what you\u2019re missing out on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: [chuckles] Yeah. I mean, you mentioned sex. Ever since they mentioned a year last week, the thought of a whole year. [chuckles]  And more. The whole (inaudible at 00:14:04) thing. That\u2019s been suddenly shot to the top of my mind. I\u2019ve been not really thinking about it, I guess, until (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C31\">at 00:14:12) this past week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a big component of a relationship. And it\u2019s been removed as an option for potentially a long while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: I think it could be an option eventually, if he ever feels good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:14:33) But, I mean, I think I\u2019ve told you before. I mean, a lot of the times, when I have horrible thoughts and I tell him, it makes me feel better. But something like that is not something he can make me feel better about, because it\u2019s so painful for him. Well, I did say it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB1\">to him and it just made him feel bad. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve said a lot of these things, but I think that was really bad. But he can\u2019t stop being in pain, either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Right. He doesn\u2019t have control (inaudible at 00:15:01) either.  I\u2019m sure that he would like to also not be in pain and be able to have a normal sex life with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: [chuckles] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: But even though, I mean, (inaudible at 00:15:12) the ideal is the same for both of you. I\u2019m sure you would both like to be healthy and be able to not even think about it. Just whenever you had an opportunity, you would have sex and it would be great. It\u2019s different for you because it\u2014you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D11\">still a healthy young woman. And he\u2019s in a lot of pain. So when you\u2019re in a lot of pain, your sex drive really drops. It\u2019s probably not something he\u2019s interested in now. In an ideal world, he\u2019d be interested. But my guess he doesn\u2019t really have much of a libido. That doesn\u2019t make yours go away. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D12\">so, you being in the position of being healthy, having a libido, and yet, not really being able to have any\u2014much access at all to your boyfriend is different. You guys are coming from a different place.  Being able to talk about with no\u2014without either one of you blaming or feeling resentful is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And no, we did talk about it a little bit but there\u2019s not really a solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: So . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re stuck in a really difficult position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s when I start thinking about this whole year, how awful that would be if it really is a year. (inaudible at 00:16:36) it\u2019s Rhode Island it\u2019s a really long wait compared to other places. It would be half the wait time in Washington.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t transport him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: You can, actually. If he wanted to go. If he wanted to (inaudible at 00:16:51) out there, he could. People do. But the thought of that is just too nuts. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty daunting, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just for another six months. I mean, six months in that context feels like nothing. But it feels like a whole lot of work just for six months. But then, six months is (inaudible at 00:17:10).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right. Because he can wait a year with the bad . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.

Can you guys problem solve how to get through the next year?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561843\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: I think really everything is put on hold by this (ph) pain. We\u2019ve talked about it a little bit and how we\u2019ll make it work. But, I mean, right now, our conversation\u2019s gotten as far as we\u2019ll make it work because we have to. [chuckles]  Yeah. I guess we haven\u2019t gotten into solutions because the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED1\">pain is just such an (crosstalk at 00:18:06) problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:18:07) So it\u2019s like revolves around figuring out how you can manage the pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean, whatever\u2019s happening just stops. Even this morning, my dad came to spend the day with him, which is the first time my dad\u2019s done it. And he walks into the kitchen and Josh is having a muscle spasm thing. My dad came over to work, but he\u2019s just\u2014you can\u2019t just leave him groaning <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">in pain while you try to do something else. And he started offering him massages or whatever. And there\u2019s just nothing to do but just watch him suffer. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Gosh, that must be so hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s awful. [chuckles] Because it\u2019s keeping him from getting stronger. It\u2019s keeping him from getting out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: How does it feel to be able to leave and not have to watch and have somebody else there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s nice to get a break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019ve been leaving him. I left him this week\u2014I had a great weekend on my own. I left him to go to a yoga class. I left him to go biking. I left him to go grocery shopping. I stopped there and drank a bottle of wine with my brother while he was asleep on the couch from pain drugs. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">And that\u2019s what\u2019s been making me feel better. But just more separate from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Right, because you were (ph) able to maintain a life for yourself right now or this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah. So, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just really sad. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Mmm, it is really sad. And it sounds like what you need to do right now in order for you to be able to keep going. And to be able to be strong enough to help him when he needs it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I\u2019m feeling less really down about, less\u2014like I just want to stay in my pajamas all day.  Maybe because of the Zoloft? Maybe just because I practice? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: It could be partly because of the Zoloft and partly because you got out and did those other things. You were getting some distraction and some joy and sense of satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and also\u2014I think the Celexa\u2019s helping me concentrate at school, I think. I feel like I can do more work than I was. I don\u2019t know. Just a little bit (inaudible at 00:20:32) having a lot of a guilt about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So it feels good to be able to be effective in your life, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Or actually more effective [chuckles], yeah.

(inaudible at 00:20:52) some practice behind you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Or just any of the things that seemed so horrible the first few times or many times are not as horrible anymore.  [That\u2019s good] (ph), I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I don\u2019t know what\u2014I guess that\u2014it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care. I just [sighs] I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if (inaudible at 00:24:00) do anything about it.  He\u2019s been bounced back and forth between his primary and there\u2019s a psychiatrist who\u2019s in charge of the pain drugs at the hospital. So that he doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201352\">get (inaudible at 00:24:13), I guess. But they keep sending him back to his primary care, who doesn\u2019t want to deal with it.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">THERAPIST: So, who becomes the person that advocates for that? When he\u2019s getting bounced back and forth the between one doctor and the next.

You have to page them and (inaudible at 00:25:10) available and wait for them to call you back. Make sure you don\u2019t miss each other (crosstalk at 00:25:14). Especially on the weekends. No one\u2019s available. [chuckles] <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201451\">Which is why they wanted the primary care to deal with it.

Because sitting in awkward positions and not having a level of physical activity and being able to stretch is not good for pain. [chuckles]  All those things that you would normally do, right, aren\u2019t possible for him.

[chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Did you ask her about the difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she didn\u2019t explain it in great detail, but she basically (inaudible at 00:29:24) seemed to see it was good enough. And I mean, the nurses up in the ICU or whatever would always say that they had to be extra, extra careful because\u2014just because of the setting [they were in] (ph). And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D1\">they would say, \u201cAt home, you can do it a little bit less this or that,\u201d or something. But I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">THERAPIST: And is that because in the hospital, there\u2019s so much you could possibly be exposed to?

[chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Got a little experience under your belt. Well, maybe it\u2019s something to chart for a couple weeks before you make a decision.

Absolutely, they\u2019d be a good distraction. And animals are typically supposed to be anxiety relievers. Pet therapy. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: [chuckles] For some people. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Right. But maybe not for you, because it\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be\u2014it\u2019s not like having a pet therapy dog come in that someone\u2019s then going to take away and take care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">THERAPIST: So, you become the handler. So, I mean, I think the benefit is, yeah, it would probably be nice to have your warm, furry, loving animals around.  But they also have needs. And those needs are going to be met by you. Josh isn\u2019t taking them for walks. He might not always\u2014there may be times <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A31\">when he\u2019s able to get out their food for you and feed them. But there are going to be times when pain takes over and he can\u2019t do that.

But there may also be things that are too much. And how do you\u2014I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A71\">maybe thinking about it over the coming week. What would it be like to have them here? So that you can balance the benefits and cons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.

You must miss them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean, in a way, it would help Josh. I hate to keep something from him that he\u2019s been wanting for so badly. Could distract him from his awful pain. And he\u2019s promised me lots of help from his mom. And he e-mailed her. Doggy daycare. With his sob story and they said they would help <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD1\">us out. So, seems like (crosstalk at 00:33:27) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Help you out how?

They have a van service that they would pick them up and his mom can give us a special deal or something.

But the likelihood he\u2019ll be able to sit there for an hour and not have to pause for some pain is small. [chuckles] I mean, (inaudible at 00:34:38) it\u2019s also just that when he is feeling okay, it feels\u2014obviously (ph) it feels harder to switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, for you to them get ready to\u2014yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">CLIENT: Into girlfriend.

And not trying to focus on work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E1\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:36:51)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E3\">THERAPIST: And I feel like being\u2014having to have all those variables line up, for you to have your guard down and actually be open to having a\u2014to holding hands or having a hug or\u2014and him be in a place where he can actually provide that.  Not sleeping off pain meds or not having a back spasm. It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201E31\">there are so many variables that need to align.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E5\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E7\">THERAPIST: And sometimes, having other ways of feeling like, yeah, you get to be focused on yourself and not thinking, \u201cWhat does he need?\u201d and \u201cI need to set this other thing aside for that.\u201d And that\u2019s what your times for yoga and going for a run is the time for you to be able to focus on, \u201cThis is <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201E71\">what I want right now.\u201d And just increasing those. Finding lots of little ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. And this past week, I felt like I can. Because I have enough energy. I didn\u2019t spend all day or all weekend in pajamas feeling gloomy. That was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Feels much better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and we had a bunch of visitors come by.  Our neighbors brought their dog by (ph). I got to hug their dog. [chuckles] I don\u2019t know. I guess I don\u2019t feel a desire just for human contact as much this past week. Just sex. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Mmm. That\u2019s harder to come by with somebody else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Not impossible. You decide whether or not that\u2019s . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s not something that he would ever go for. Sometimes I feel like a bad person because I could imagine creating some sort of arrangement, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Mmm. He\u2019s not open to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s completely understandable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:38:48)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">CLIENT: I want to think I am but maybe I\u2019m not, really. If the roles were reversed? I don\u2019t know. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s really hard to answer that question for yourself. It\u2019s not a position that many people have to find themselves answering. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">CLIENT: But, yeah. I mean, the thought of when we could ever have a normal or comfortable relationship again it could be a really long time from now. It\u2019s already been a really long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">THERAPIST: How understand was he that you still have a normal sex drive, even though he\u2019s not available and might not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">THERAPIST: Does he get that piece?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">CLIENT: Yeah. Definitely. His brain understands. His body just doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, his body\u2019s in a very different place than yours. His body\u2019s being ravaged by lots of different things right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think he\u2019ll be willing to talk about all kinds of stuff once the back starts (inaudible at 00:39:50). I mean, he just goes into pain world. I\u2019ve been teasing him about it. Hopefully he doesn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m teasing him about being in pain world (crosstalk at 00:39:58). You can see it <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D1\">in his face, it\u2019s just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2020C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561843\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">THERAPIST: He goes to a different place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">THERAPIST: Well, humor can be a useful way or trying to diffuse the tension in the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20215\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t think I made him cry this week by teasing him about something that\u2019s not\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20217\">THERAPIST: That you found out was off limits?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20219\">CLIENT: Or, I mean, he seems to have a more\u2014I don\u2019t know, emotional reserve, maybe? Despite all of his pain. I don\u2019t know why. And in the hospital, he\u2019d be so exhausted and frustrated. I mean, maybe (inaudible at 00:40:38) it\u2019s helpful in that he\u2019s got control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s got more control.

And his mental state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20223\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, hopefully if he\u2019s sleeping bit better, that does give him a little bit more of emotional reserves, because the\u2014pain will certainly contribute to having a lot of mood swings.  And just being very on-edge. Having everything really close to the surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20225\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20227\">THERAPIST: Sleep deprivation is another thing that often makes you more emotionally (inaudible at 00:41:13).

I mean, he\u2019s also on blood thinners that are constantly out of whack. He\u2019s been waking up with blood everywhere the past couple nights. Which would be a giant problem if the pain wasn\u2019t a bigger problem. [chuckles] We had to get a nurse special aid just to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202291\">come yesterday to check his blood thinner levels, because his mouth was (inaudible at 00:41:46). Something I think I teased him about. And he was okay about yesterday. It was that he kind of looks like a vampire or something when he smiles there\u2019s (crosstalk at 00:41:53).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s drooling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022D\">CLIENT: Blood everywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s amazing what you become comfortable with, huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20231\">CLIENT: [chuckles] I know. Our neighbors came over.  And he was telling them about that. And one of them is a\u2014she\u2019s a doctor. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s a doctor. Anyway. But they were both just cringing. [chuckles] That sounds really gross. He\u2019s just telling them about his (inaudible at 00:42:16). How he <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202311\">woke up in the middle of the night with a candy coating of blood on his (inaudible at 00:42:20). That (inaudible at 00:42:24) really gross. But it\u2019s our normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s become your normal. You\u2019ve been learning to tolerate all sorts of things that you\u2019d never thought you\u2019d be exposed to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">CLIENT: Yes. But his pain is such a much bigger problem than that. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">THERAPIST: It interferes a lot more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, (inaudible at 00:42:45) sleeping great at all, because he keeps waking up with blood \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">CLIENT: oozing blood, yeah. And unfortunately, this drug is managed by a whole separate service of people.  Which are hard to get in touch with, too, so . . . just\u2014I mean, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s their only job, is to keep his blood levels (inaudible at 00:43:09).

I mean, everything you eat, everything you do changes \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20243\">THERAPIST: Changes it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20245\">CLIENT: the levels of the\u2014they constantly keep asking if he eats too many green vegetables.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20247\">THERAPIST: Usually, that\u2019s not a problem. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20249\">CLIENT: Right.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024F\">THERAPIST: And so keeping track of all these details . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20251\">CLIENT: And we had gotten into an okay place until\u2014for a few days, at least, until (inaudible at 00:43:49).

I mean, he could die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20253\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t want clots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20255\">CLIENT: He could just die. I mean, in an instant, if it goes too low.  And they freaked out. And they sent us to see if he has to get this bag of needles full of a quick-acting blood thinner that\u2014and this was late at night when they\u2014I got this call from CVS that they had these needles. [chuckles] And, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202551\">I mean, they\u2019re beyond what I do for his antibiotics. They\u2019re just needle needles that you just inject in the skin.

Oh, he did it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025D\">CLIENT: Except that he\u2019s on all these blood thinners, so he \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025F\">THERAPIST: Right. So if you stab yourself in the stomach, you start bleeding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20261\">CLIENT: Well, not even that he started gushing blood. But he\u2019s got, still, after half a week, this huge, bloody bruise on his stomach because\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just awful. It\u2019s awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20263\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just bleeding under the skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20265\">CLIENT: [chuckles] I\u2019m sorry.

But Laura (ph), I\u2019m amazed by your resilience. Not just in accommodating to getting comfortable with seeing your partner in pain and oozing blood and dealing with these things, but just your resilience of how you\u2019ve been able to accommodate to your life changing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2026F1\">Day to day and week to week, sometimes. In ways that you could never have prepared yourself for. And you\u2019ve been able to figure out for yourself what you want.  And figure out how to get through it day by day. Being able to step back sometimes and just honor for yourself of how much you\u2019ve done and <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2026F2\">how much you continue to do. You\u2019re pretty amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20271\">CLIENT: Thanks. Well, you only see what I tell you about this. [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20273\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re pretty honest. And being amazing and strong and resilient doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t sometimes freak out. Or that you don\u2019t freak out a lot of the time. There\u2019s a difference between being strong and being unfeeling. I think you\u2019re getting really strong, because there are challenges <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202731\">and it is really hard. And yet, you\u2019re doing it anyway. And you\u2019re taking the best care of yourself. And you\u2019re taking really good care of him as you can. And I know that you get freaked out about it. And that you\u2019re anxious. And that it gets in the way of your sleep sometimes. And that you don\u2019t do <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202732\">all the things that used to be on your to-do list.

And now, you know how to manage that, too. [And it was] (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2027F1\">something you had never seen before, so you weren\u2019t very good at it at first rush.

And then, sometimes we get feedback that it\u2019s not working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20285\">CLIENT: [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20287\">THERAPIST: And that was the process you went through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20289\">CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible at 00:48:55) decisions. But every time Josh says something like, \u201cI don\u2019t want ruin our relationship (crosstalk at 00:49:03) sleep in the bed.\u201d  Can\u2019t help it. I think (inaudible at 00:49:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2028B\">THERAPIST: Maybe you can help him to recognize what\u2019s going on in the current and how that\u2019s different than the past. And you both need to live in the relationship that you have now and the relationship that you are working to have for later. Which is different than where you were a year ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2028D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think we can talk about it a whole lot more when he\u2019s able.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2028F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. For the moments that he\u2019s able to be more present and not dealing with him in crisis. It\u2019s hard to have to put those things on hold, as you don\u2019t know when there\u2019s going to be a pain spike or something else that gets in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20291\">CLIENT: Yeah. It makes me think about how do you talk about biking (inaudible at 00:50:01)?  He would always say how good he was at suffering. [chuckles] He is. On a bike ride, he\u2019d just basically sit in pain for six hours. At your physical limit. Suffering. [chuckles] And I mean, in some ways, he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202911\">really good at that, just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N20290-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20290-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561843\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20293\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s got really high pain tolerance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20295\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. But he\u2019s good at sitting with it for a really, really long time. I wonder if he has really low pain tolerance. [chuckles] At least, from what people tell us. Or he (crosstalk at 00:50:37).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20297\">THERAPIST: Which is why he\u2019s feeling it so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20299\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2029B\">THERAPIST: But yet, enduring it. Really high endurance, maybe, is the way to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2029D\">CLIENT: Pain endurance. Yeah. I forget where I was going with this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2029F\">THERAPIST: You said that thinking about your relationship reminds you of the way that he would talk about a bike ride.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A1\">CLIENT: Not relationship. I guess the way he deals with it. He\u2019s just able to be up\u2014I mean, because he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s still working at his limit\u2014physical limit.  Doing really, really well, while in incredible pain. Just a hard thing to be able to do, I think. Not just on a bicycle but in life. So, functioning well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A3\">THERAPIST: Even with the pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A5\">CLIENT: I mean, people keep trying to help us fix things. But there\u2019s not a lot we can fix right now. Just has to fix itself eventually. It just has to suck right now. We just have to let it. And be okay with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A7\">THERAPIST: I guess I wonder if it would be helpful to find some people who are willing to sit with you while it sucks. Because sometimes, it\u2019s the comfort of having somebody there with you. Not necessarily trying to fix something if it\u2019s not something that can be fixed. And just being willing to sit <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202A71\">with you while he\u2019s in pain, while you\u2019re suffering because it\u2019s not\u2014things aren\u2019t the way you want them to be. You have people that are good at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202A9\">CLIENT: My brother, last night, I mean, he was perfectly willing to sit there while Josh slept off his pain drugs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And be with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so, I mean, that\u2019s something I\u2019m doing better this time. Is letting people see how much it sucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202AF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And letting them support you. It\u2019s a huge difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202B1\">CLIENT: I mean, today I had tea with my lab mates. And they were like, \u201cHow\u2019s Josh?\u201d (inaudible at 00:52:15) terrible (ph). [chuckles] And they were like, \u201cThat sucks.\u201d So it\u2019s really, really helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It is, to have people you can be real with and who won\u2019t get scared off by that. And they can agree with you that yes, it sucks. And (inaudible at 00:52:30) seems to like to sit and have tea with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202B5\">CLIENT: And also just doing that has become less of a\u2014not event, but less anxiety provoking (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Because, well, you\u2019ve tried it out. You\u2019ve tested out the waters. You\u2019ve let people in. You\u2019ve let them see what it\u2019s like. And there\u2019s been a whole bunch of people that haven\u2019t run away screaming. Yeah. Some people can\u2019t handle it, but a lot\u2014it sounds like you\u2019ve got some good people <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N202B71\">in your life that can be there in the (inaudible at 00:52:53) you need them to be. So, and you lean on them as much as you can. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I am worried about my dad all day. Causing him lots of anxiety. Because he\u2019s definitely a fixer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202BB\">THERAPIST: Well, let your dad\u2014your dad\u2019s a grown-up. He\u2019s dealt with it a long time. You don\u2019t have to fix it for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202BD\">CLIENT: Right. I\u2019m sure today\u2019s going to cause him a lot of stress, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202BF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay. Your day also causes you stress sometimes. It\u2019s okay for your dad to be stressed out. He can go home and work it out however he can. Him having an anxious day will not dramatically alter what the rest of his week is like.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P15-N202BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"14\"><span data-id=\"P15-N202BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":16,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561843\" data-realpage=\"16\" data-page=\"16\">\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202C1\">CLIENT: But you don\u2019t know.
