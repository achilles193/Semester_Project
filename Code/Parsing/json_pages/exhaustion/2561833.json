(LAUGHTER) I\u2019m so overwhelmed. I don\u2019t even know what to even think. I\u2019m like still half way in my pajamas from this morning.

So I\u2019m going to go today after (inaudible at 00:00:53) the visiting nurse, he showed up this morning like halfway through what she was doing. So... (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">(PAUSE) (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s okay.

I think I told you last week I was going away last weekend which, in fact, was causing me a lot of stress and did cause me a lot of stress and was a pretty stressful weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: So you did go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I did go. Actually, I went late because Josh (ph) was bleeding on Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: But no one seemed to think much of it. So once he got past the stress of freaking out about it which took him pretty much all day until someone told us it was not a problem, I had decided not to go to the party, the bachelorette weekend until the next day. But then two days of it was plenty <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">for me. It was exhausting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t turn out to be a good sort of get away and distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Well, it was good. It just caused me a whole heck of a lot of stress also. I mean, I didn\u2019t sleep (PAUSE) did things that I wouldn\u2019t normally do. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: That were fun or were uncomfortable or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: They were fun. I mean, there was dancing and I slipped away to go skiing. But it was just the opposite of relaxing, I guess. (PAUSE) You know, it was fun to get dressed up and dance, I guess. But... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t even know. (PAUSE) It was also... I mean, this girl I was always pretty much <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">jealous of my entire life. She\u2019s my next door neighbor. And her family had a lot more money and they were always... And she was much more confident than me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">Her mom would like tell her like, would show her how to do her nails or... I don\u2019t know. She was just always... She was just popular and pretty and all this and whatnot. And I don\u2019t know. Especially in middle school I was getting made fun of by people too because my mom didn\u2019t tell me to wear deodorant <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">or... I don\u2019t know. Whatever. So there was like middle school baggage brought up and like... (LAUGHTER) This girl and all her friends (inaudible at 00:03:33) always wanted to be more like her when I was little. I don\u2019t know. That just fed into my stress, I guess, about the whole weekend of feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">I needed to keep up, I guess. They\u2019re not people I\u2019m super comfortable with, I guess, despite the fact that we\u2019re really good friends. (PAUSE) Taking (inaudible). I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: You clearly felt uncomfortable and like you couldn\u2019t really be yourself and relaxed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I mean, I was myself. I just wasn\u2019t relaxed about it. (PAUSE) It made me feel a little crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: It felt so different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You felt like you didn\u2019t quite fit with the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right. And I didn\u2019t quite expect to. But it was still just really stressful. (PAUSE) So... Okay. Something I\u2019ve been thinking about since last time is when I was telling you about feeling panicked. And you had said, \u201cWell, a panic attack is such and such and such.\u201d And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">actually really had a panic attack. I was trying to think about it based on those criteria. It just sort of this knot of anxiety that goes up...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And down and never really goes away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: ...or down. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Does it ever go away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I guess not. (PAUSE) Depends how much anxiety (inaudible at 00:04:59) personality that I want to have or not. (LAUGHTER) I mean, I guess I can think of times where it\u2019s been pretty low. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: How much does it matter to you whether it truly qualifies as a panic attack or whether it\u2019s just heightened anxiety that goes up or down? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: (SIGH) Well, panic attack, I guess you were saying, is more like a defined episode that ends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And yours never... Does it end? Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, sure. I mean, if it\u2019s like levels. It goes up and down for sure and at some points it\u2019s a problem and at some points it\u2019s not a problem. (PAUSE) I guess it\u2019s a problem when I feel like I can\u2019t handle the current situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So in terms of like... If we think of anxiety as like a family of disorders... But we don\u2019t really say disorders because we have diagnoses for them. Right? So... So there\u2019s a big heading of anxiety and there\u2019s all different forms that anxiety can take. Panic disorder is considered one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">the types of anxiety disorders. You\u2019re allowed to have as many different anxiety disorders as fit. It\u2019s not like you get one or the other, you know, can\u2019t go together. So, you know, really the only... Diagnosis is helpful in helping you to sort of understand... It gives me a way of being able to kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">of quickly think about what your situation is like. But, other than that, I mean, it doesn\u2019t really change... I mean, whether we say, yes, there are true panic attacks happening superimposed on general levels of anxiety or not, that doesn\u2019t really change so much kind of... It doesn\u2019t change at all what\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D3\">going on in your life and it doesn\u2019t change so much the treatment that you\u2019re getting because you already have, you know, medication for anxiety and Joan (ph) gave you stuff to take sort of PRM. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">You know, if something gets more intense, you could have something that you take as needed. So, you know, whether that\u2019s heightened anxiety or panic attack, it doesn\u2019t so much matter. But for your own sense of sort of, you know, clarity about what might be going on for you, a panic attack is generally, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">if it\u2019s going to go by the book, is going to be a discrete episode that has a start and a stop and the feelings during that episode tend to be physical in addition to the sort of worried thoughts that you sort of kind of carry with you a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Well, right. They go... I mean, you can\u2019t separate the thoughts and the physical. At least I can\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t feel like the physical discrete episode.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess like last night...

(PAUSE) It\u2019s helping him (LAUGHTER) even though I think it\u2019s a little crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It gives him something happy to focus on and something that gives him some control in a way he can\u2019t...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: He\u2019s gone crazy. I saw him... He was about to send an e-mail to his two best friends telling them about how we were getting married in October. I was like, \u201cWhoa. Please don\u2019t tell anyone anything. (LAUGHTER) Holy crap.\u201d But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Are you getting married in October? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

I was making him dinner last night in kind of a state in trying to get him in order while he was going on and on about florists or something. (LAUGHTER) And he said something about how he wanted to give me his heart in October but hopefully it would be a different heart, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">not his heart. And I just started crying. In fact, I\u2019m crying just thinking about it. Sorry. (CRYING)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: For no reason, just because I\u2019m so tired and... (PAUSE) This is exactly what happened. I can\u2019t even say it. (PAUSE) Why am I telling you this story? I guess it\u2019s just boiling over. (PAUSE) And he\u2019s been doing the same thing too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">We walked in yesterday and our dogs weren\u2019t there, which he knew, but he just lost it. It\u2019s like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Like the reality...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: ...kind of hits you at different moments. So it\u2019s... I mean, it sounds like that comment that, \u201cI want to give you my heart but it\u2019s hopefully not going to be mine,\u201d it\u2019s like reality that you\u2019re waiting for a new heart for him. And not having your dogs at home is a reminder of how difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">and intense it\u2019s been that you, you know, placed them for foster care right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Or, I guess... I mean, thinking about our wedding, that\u2019s about... Everything is like \u201cyour heart this,\u201d \u201clove that.\u201d It\u2019s all going to be based on... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just going to have so much more... I don\u2019t want to say meaning. It\u2019s not meaning. It\u2019s just... (PAUSE) It\u2019s like a really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">loaded thing to say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

We\u2019re both sort of just hanging by a thread. (PAUSE) (SIGH) And, I mean, little things have been setting him off all over the place. (PAUSE) I need to go... I guess he\u2019s coping by planning our wedding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: How are you coping?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve had a chance yet, really. There\u2019s been no time to cope. Well, I guess I\u2019m coping in spending the day planning how I can go for a run before I go home because Josh\u2019s mom isn\u2019t home and I need to talk to her when I get home and do a whole lot more stuff. There will be no relaxing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">once I get home. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">And I haven\u2019t had a chance to do anything for myself yet.

I mean, all the sudden it\u2019s hard. I mean, we walked into the house with all this stuff, got him sort of situated and he needed to go to the bathroom and he couldn\u2019t sit all the way down to the toilet <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">because it was so low. And he\u2019s got these pumps that won\u2019t allow... I mean, I wasn\u2019t... I\u2019m still not sure if it\u2019s pain or physically not possible, one of the two. And then he just lost it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">He started having like a... It didn\u2019t last very long. But, I mean... (LAUGHTER) He had a moment because he couldn\u2019t sit on the toilet. So then I had to go to CVS. I had to go to CVS to get his medication and a raised up toilet seat and his medication lists didn\u2019t match up. I had two of them and they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">didn\u2019t match up with what the pharmacy got or each other. So then I spent an hour on the phone paging doctors at the hospital. And then some of... The pharmacy didn\u2019t even have one of his drugs. So... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) We got home and it was suddenly just like an eruption of problems. And I\u2019m still...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yeah. As much as prepared as you try to be, there\u2019s these things that like nobody thought or told you about. Like no one at the hospital prepped you that he would need a raised toilet seat. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a host of other things sort of that can be adapted maybe that you don\u2019t realize until <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">you get there and see what the challenges are for him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) I mean, he\u2019s barely had a chance to like be in the house. (PAUSE) And now I\u2019m afraid to go home and see what happened. And this morning, I mean, this morning... So not only did he go home with these pumps that have to have the dressing changed all the time, he had to go home with... <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">We got this all thrown at us yesterday. This antibiotic... Two antibiotic in his arm. One needs to be changed every day. They both need to be changed every day. (LAUGHTER) So they run us off all these med lists, which of course I didn\u2019t notice at the time didn\u2019t match and then spent an hour and a half <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">training us on how to change these IVs. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Wow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just really overwhelming. For these antibiotics that, I mean, if we do it wrong, could either give him another infection or not give him the antibiotics that are keeping the infection at bay. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: It was just... (LAUGHTER) It wasn\u2019t even scary. It was just a lot. No one told us about this. We\u2019re supposed to leave at three o\u2019clock and the nurse comes in at one o\u2019clock with this box of refrigerated antibiotics and goes through. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of responsibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a lot to get right. And people keep saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Like ten different people said, \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget about this and don\u2019t forget about this.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cCan you write this all down?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cSure.\u201d And things don\u2019t match up and... It\u2019s just incredible to me how carefully things were... Well, okay. Things were (inaudible at 00:15:45) at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B1\">the hospital but more carefully than... (PAUSE) And then we rush out.

(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: It is a lot to take on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: It is. This morning I spent several hours just changing all his dressings and antibiotics and things and trying not to contaminate him all on the couch. You know, the hospital, you just throw things on the floor. Someone cleans it up later. They have a medical waste bin. You\u2019ve got a trash can, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">several of them. (PAUSE) And then, all the while, Josh is bugging me to get our dogs home. How on earth are they going to be able to come home? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That\u2019s a tough environment for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure it out how to make it work for him. But I think we both had some fantasy that him coming home would be better. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s going to take some adjustment.

A few days before he left, there was a girl actually named Katie (ph) who had the same device who was somewhat our age who had been discharged and then she showed up back at the hospital with a bleed from her stomach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: So, I mean, it just... (PAUSE) I\u2019m almost convinced that something\u2019s going to happen. He\u2019s going to end up back in the hospital it seems like, especially the way they just sort of send you home with all this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot to take on. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, he never really feels that stable. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and they tell us... First, there was this nurse, this lady with this VAD (ph) who has four kids running around. I have no idea how she could be possibly doing that. I mean, every time Josh moves, he\u2019s like basically bleeding or something\u2019s falling off or... (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Gosh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: I mean, he\u2019s got this bag of antibiotics. It\u2019s just... It\u2019s almost ridiculous. It\u2019s almost so ridiculous it\u2019s funny. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: It might be funny if it were a TV show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: If I could not think about the fact that it could kill him at any moment, it\u2019s kind of funny. (PAUSE) (SIGH) (PAUSE) Oh. Also, this morning he was bleeding even from like, his gums were bleeding. And he made the visiting nurse take the blood thinner... And it was like way higher than it should <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">have been. So we noticed... Who forgot to do something or what happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even know if that got resolved or not. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: How often does the visiting nurse come?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Oh good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: For two weeks. Yeah. But (inaudible at 00:19:05) just in case the nurses at the hospital don\u2019t get them and they want to know. I don\u2019t know. Just... (PAUSE) It\u2019s incredible to me how disorganized everything has become all of the sudden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And there\u2019s really no... You end up as the point person for trying to organize it all and trying to communicate between the nurse and the hospital and Josh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, if I had to be at school today or if I was going to drop out if I didn\u2019t show up at school at like eleven... But I could... I mean, I could still be doing things at home I\u2019m sure. I mean, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to work out.

But I\u2019ve got so many other people that rely on me that... They\u2019ve been asking me for things and it almost doesn\u2019t matter at this point. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Do you want to take the semester off or is that still an option? Do you feel like you need that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just that... It\u2019s just leading to my, I mean, adding to my exhaustion, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. This is another role that you want to fill.

I mean... Okay. I start panicking thinking about it all day (inaudible at 00:21:07).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like how am I going to do that without going home first? (LAUGHTER) It\u2019s been taking up way to much energy which is really frustrating. I wish I could just relax. But I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Well, you have a pair of sneakers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s all you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah. It makes me... Also, while I\u2019m thinking about this, I don\u2019t know but it seems crazy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: A pair of shorts and a road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Well, I guess, you know, I\u2019m a little nuts. I just bought a pair on the way over here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Perfect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: It feels nuts. It feels completely nuts. And I also probably won\u2019t tell Josh that I\u2019ve done that because he will not understand. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you need it. You need to have something that\u2019s for you that helps to discharge some of your anxiety and lets you clear your head and just be in the zone for a little bit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">And you are holding together a lot of pieces and so making sure that you do something for you is really important because you can\u2019t hold together all these pieces for everybody else if you\u2019re not okay. And this... It sounds like, one, being able to think about the fact that you\u2019re going to go take some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">time for yourself allowed you to get through the other parts of your day and it keeps you just sane enough to be able to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: I guess, I mean, it\u2019s also incredible energy. It\u2019s still like anxious thinking, I guess. I mean, even when I was at this bachelorette party, I had missed the day when they all went downhill skiing and I had my ski stuff in the car and we had just been out drinking all night. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">And then they were going to sit around drinking in all day. And the thought of that caused me so much stress that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really not where you wanted to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) That I spend probably hours stressing over whether I should go home, use Josh as an excuse... Well, he\u2019s not an excuse. Decide that I should go and leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Or go skiing which is exhausting. The thought of it was so exhausting. But the thought of staying was impossible which also made me feel insane. So I went skiing and it was... (PAUSE) It helped. But it was also exhausting. I wish there was something I could do. I did try to take an Ativan. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">think it helped some tiny little percent. But it was like just sitting and relaxing was not possible. (PAUSE) Which I probably could have used. (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t know. Hopefully all of this...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: ...coping is not going to like make everything worse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not going to make everything worse. (PAUSE) It\u2019s hard to tell yourself to relax. You\u2019re obviously really tense and keyed up and worried.

It\u2019s not where your life is right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Well, and one of them... So my friend is a social worker who is having the bachelorette party. And one of them... So half of them are social workers from her grad program. One of them was a (inaudible) social worker from Mass General (ph). (LAUGHTER) And I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of things I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">wanted to ask her yet I did not want to talk about all of this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Which also made me just want to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I could... That\u2019s a really odd situation to be in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Every time I sat and talked to her... And she was mostly, the whole weekend, you know, talking about (inaudible at 00:25:15). And I\u2019d start thinking about things I wanted to ask her. You know, it was definitely an odd situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: Did they know sort of what was going on with Josh at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Every one of them knew, in fact. And we talked for a little bit. Another girl... I mean, another girl had just had a baby and her baby had just been in the ER the night before and was freaking out about that. And she kept thinking about whether she should leave or not. But no one else <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B1\">felt the need to run out and go skiing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Well, they had already gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Everyone else was sort of being too relaxed (inaudible at 00:25:55) made me feel nuts. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">(PAUSE) It was a little bit like other times I\u2019ve been away where being with other people made me so self-conscious of also my anxiety because also I was sleeping in a room with four girls. And the second night, I lost my ear plugs which were really good. And I could hear everything and I couldn\u2019t handle <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">it. And in the middle of the night I had to like find some quieter corner to hide out in where I finally went to sleep. But that was also just so embarrassing. And it\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened to me being away with other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">CLIENT: It wasn\u2019t as bad as some other times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">THERAPIST: I know it\u2019s been a really challenging piece to try to find a space that sort of fits your requirements to be able to sleep and not having control over the situation is really hard. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy. But I do think that you\u2019re really anxious. And you have a lot of good reasons to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201271\">be really anxious right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">You know, combined with the fact that you tend to run at a higher anxiety state than, you know, what most people\u2019s baseline is. So the combination of already being pretty up there sometimes and then having all of these really good reasons to be anxious, places you pretty close to panicking. And maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201291\">not in the typical sort of panic attack mode because, like you said, there isn\u2019t really this start and then release that a panic attack tends to have. That tends to be a discrete period. But I think you\u2019re panicking which is exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: It is exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I mean, to be running the level of intensity that it requires to be this anxious for this long, it\u2019s an enormous amount of energy you\u2019re using up.

(PAUSE) I knew things were getting pretty bad last week when I tried... I forget why I took an Ambien last week. I think I was so stressed about going away. (PAUSE) I mean, even just about how I was going to clean the house and go grocery shopping before Josh came home, all of which <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201331\">I did yesterday morning before the day even became exhausting. (LAUGHTER) Like how I was going to do those things before the bachelorette party was causing me not to sleep. So I took one and then woke up at five AM. But then I was encouraged... By the next night, I decided to try an Ativan instead and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201332\">I slept in until nine. And I\u2019m sure Ativan could be helpful also in the future. Except this weekend there was too much alcohol involved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You don\u2019t want to combine that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: I forgot to take all medications today. I barely made it out of my pajamas. (LAUGHTER) So that probably didn\u2019t help the situation either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So I think figuring out how to make a small space for yourself so that you can do your, make sure you take care of you too. You get to take your meds. You get to have a half an hour to go do your own thing whether that be a little bit of yoga or a run or if you can find an hour, that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">great. But there needs to be some space to take care of you. You\u2019re not going to be able to have, help anybody else if you\u2019re completely exhausted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: I for some reason thought that there would be more time for that when Josh was home because I wouldn\u2019t be driving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s less commuting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh my gosh. I mean, I\u2019m so happy not to have to drive to the hospital today. But, I mean, even just the fact that I\u2019m going to have to interact with Josh\u2019s mom causes me enough anxiety besides all the other stuff. (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I mean, he can\u2019t do anything at all for himself whatsoever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: Maybe that will get a little bit better. This is the first day. There\u2019s a lot of adjustment the first day home. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: Maybe holding out some hope that, you know, once you get some routines in place you\u2019ll get more comfortable. This is the first day that you did the IV and the antibiotic and the, you know, all of that. When it\u2019s the tenth day, it\u2019s going to be a little bit easier for you. Those pieces will <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201451\">become less cumbersome. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. He needs to go to the doctor Friday and on Monday and on Tuesday (inaudible at 00:31:15).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20149\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so hard. I wish that the homecoming felt better for you and for him. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been so hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B\">CLIENT: Well, it was really great for like a little moment last night when we were both sitting on the couch and he was picking out his suit. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I mean, that was nice, I guess. I wasn\u2019t sitting on a hospital couch anticipating having to drive home and (inaudible) that\u2019s a little nicer, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014B1\">I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: There will be lots more of those kinds of moments to balance out the other stuff. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: The next two weeks are going to be awful because he needs to be taken care of 24\/7 basically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: Who else can come help?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: My dad, I think, can come help too and Josh\u2019s mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: Is there a rotation set up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: We did. Not at the moment. Right now, his mom is just coming. (PAUSE) I barely have a chance to like (inaudible at 00:32:47) and fill him in on what\u2019s going on because I didn\u2019t even really believe he was coming over yesterday until, I guess, they let us go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: Until you actually walked out? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yep. (PAUSE) I mean, other people can help. It\u2019s great his mom is there. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s great that someone is. But it also requires that you\u2019re then kind of interacting with her more than you would like. And so maybe even having other people there as a buffer so that you\u2019re not having to spend time with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: I mean, unfortunately the people who cause me the most anxiety to interact with are my dad and his mom. I wish there was somebody else. But... I mean, unless there was Phil (ph). There\u2019s nobody else. I mean, I almost killed him mom when she walked in and started complaining about how there was <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F1\">no parking. I was trying to get to school. (LAUGHTER) Oh, she had wanted me to leave the car, my car because Josh can\u2019t get in her car because it\u2019s a two door and there\u2019s no way he can get in with his device and he\u2019s not allowed to sit in the front seat anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">But there was no way I was going to be able to leave the car there and make it to school on time. And so I snapped at her. Hopefully she wasn\u2019t too offended. If there was an emergency, we\u2019d call 911. She wouldn\u2019t drive him. Or... I don\u2019t know. If there was an emergency and she needed a car, we\u2019ll drive <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201611\">him. There was just no way that was going to happen. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have time to stay and argue about it. (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s a good plan. If there\u2019s an emergency, you call 911. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: I mean, I wish I felt... She keeps asking me if I need anything. I wish I could be honest with her about what I need. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: What would you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: Well, it would be great if she would just come... I mean, I\u2019ve been tempted to call her and ask if she would, you know, call her on the way home and ask her if she would go. I also don\u2019t want to offend her. So I can go home and just relax, not have to talk to her and everything. (PAUSE) That <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201691\">also feels really selfish because I know Josh\u2019s mom needs me to help support her too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot. (PAUSE) Is there something in between that? Is there a way to make interacting with her easier when you get home and the transition between her being there and you being there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: Yeah. If I go run first. (LAUGHTER) So that\u2019s my plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">THERAPIST: And then I wonder if sort of making your interaction with her really specific... You know, what do you need to know about how the time went or anything that happened during the time so that maybe that would make the conversation easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2016E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just the way she is and it\u2019s not her fault. I just... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. Operate on different... It\u2019s the same with my dad. But at least with my dad I could be blunt with him. My mom was trying to talk to me while... I had gone straight from the bachelorette to the hospital and my mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201751\">was there and she was coming and she wanted to talk to me. And I told her I couldn\u2019t have her around because I hadn\u2019t slept in like three days and had basically been drinking continuously for three days and skiing and freaking out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">And she (inaudible at 00:37:03) mom. (PAUSE) I called her and apologized the next day. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) And both of them, both moms are exhausting also in that... I mean, yesterday Josh was having... Or on Sunday... Whatever day I was there with his mom, I mean my mom... Josh was having incredible <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201771\">back spasms. They were causing him so much pain he was just like groaning in the chair. My mom... I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s ever seen him quite like that. I certainly have. There was nothing I could do about it at the time. And they were having the pain people come in. Oh. And then Josh\u2019s mom did show up and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201772\">the two of them were just talking about how frustrated they were about it and what they could do about it. I forgot what I was saying here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">THERAPIST: They were both really frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">CLIENT: Oh. And I mean I\u2019ve been getting e-mails and calls from my mom about his back and she\u2019s trying to find a chair that would be more comfortable and all that sort of thing. And she also wouldn\u2019t leave that day. He was sitting there in pain and I had to make her leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: So you feel like they just don\u2019t get it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s that they\u2019re wanting to help is also stressful. I mean, he definitely does want a chair. But... (LAUGHTER) If they want to help and get him a chair, it just needs to... They can make it appear. I can\u2019t participate. Participating in them finding solutions <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F1\">that they need need to happen is exhausting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like another thing added to your list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">CLIENT: And this is... This happens with relatives all the time I feel like. They want to help. But they also... I mean, I have an aunt who wants to buy me a futon. But the amount of effort I had to put into helping her helping me was not worth it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I understand what you mean because it sounds like... Yeah. I would be great if the perfect chair appeared in your house. But you\u2019re so busy doing, taking care of other things that need to get done as well that adding that on your list of things to pay attention to is not helpful. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201851\">if she\u2019s sending you links of chairs to look at, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t have time to be looking at, you know, the nine different chairs she\u2019s discovered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, I want to make her less concerned because I know that she\u2019s... I mean, I can see it in her face the other day when she was watching him groan and cry out in pain that like it was really making her upset. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">Which is makes me feel like I can\u2019t be upset. She\u2019s upset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">THERAPIST: How come you can\u2019t both be upset at the same time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it\u2019s okay for you to be upset together. And maybe if you could let yourself do that... It\u2019s not your job to make everybody not upset. So if your mom is upset or his mom is upset, it doesn\u2019t become your job to take away their distress. You can be upset too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2018E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20191\">CLIENT: I mean, that\u2019s always been something I\u2019m not able to do is be upset. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">THERAPIST: Let other people have their own feelings. It doesn\u2019t have to chance yours and you don\u2019t have to take care of theirs. That might make it... If you can let go of that, let go of that desire or need to sort of take care of the other people, it might make it easier for you. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20195\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, to take care of them it just... They\u2019re not helping me by being there and acting that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20197\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20199\">CLIENT: They want to help. And, in fact... I had talked about this with the couple, the girl who had the heart transplant. I was actually surprised. The boyfriend had said he, at one point, had a social worker kick out her parents because all they were doing was hovering and worrying and it was making <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201991\">everyone more stressed out. And he had told... They had talked to the social worker about how upset it was making them to have their parents or her parents be doing that. And she said, \u201cIf you want me to, I\u2019ll kick them out and tell them they can\u2019t be here anymore. Or it would be better for everyone <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201992\">if they went home.\u201d And I was really surprised. That\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s exactly what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s horrible. Yeah. I feel they don\u2019t have the right to do that. Maybe I do. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F\">THERAPIST: You certainly do in your own home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A1\">CLIENT: Well, at home I can\u2019t because it\u2019s either I\u2019m there or somebody else is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Right. But you don\u2019t... But you can kick out Pat (ph). Right? It\u2019s her name? You can kick her out when you get home. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A5\">CLIENT: I guess I wish I had a social worker there to... (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A7\">THERAPIST: It would be much easier. Yes. It would be really nice to have somebody else to do that. And you don\u2019t have one there to say the words for you. But you can certainly invoke the social worker to say, \u201cGet home. Alright. I\u2019m home now. Thanks for taking care of Josh while I was gone. It\u2019s better <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A71\">not to overwhelm him. So now that I\u2019m home... The social worker said not to overwhelm him.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A9\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">THERAPIST: \u201cSo now that I\u2019m home you can go and rest. And can you come back at whatever time tomorrow?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">CLIENT: I guess you know what else is different about it too is that Josh seems to look not like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AF\">THERAPIST: He likes having her there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B1\">CLIENT: I mean, yeah. He\u2019s... He seems to like having my mom there worrying. Or at least, when I ask him, he doesn\u2019t share my feelings about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B3\">It just seems like the other couple...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B5\">THERAPIST: They were more aligned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B7\">CLIENT: ...were aligned in that feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And so... But you also count. So, you know, what\u2019s useful for Josh and what\u2019s good for him counts. But what\u2019s good for you also counts. So, you know, he\u2019s got, I think, balancing the care and the attention that he\u2019s getting from having people there and the stress that you feel or you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B91\">imaging you\u2019re going to feel when she\u2019s there, you know, you have to weigh that out.

But they are other beings to take care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s been... It\u2019s just been such a constant battle ever since with Josh about that. And the lady who was training us yesterday on the antibiotics... I don\u2019t remember why we mentioned dogs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D1\">Someone brought up our dogs. And Josh said something to her about how they were abandoned by their mother. (LAUGHTER) And she took that literally. She was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s terrible.\u201d She thought we were taking care of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D5\">CLIENT: ...dogs or something. I had to set her straight. And like he says things like that sometimes just jokingly and then sometimes he starts crying and freaking out about them. And I hate to like take away more than he already has had taken away. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But it\u2019s a lot of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D9\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to be able to understand each other on that. I think I\u2019m just going to have to put my foot down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB\">THERAPIST: There is a very big difference between placing your dogs in good care when you\u2019re not able to do it and abandoning them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">CLIENT: Well, I can\u2019t make him...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t make him see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">CLIENT: ...see that. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Well, I think it\u2019s important that you know that other people can see that. And that\u2019s the choice you made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. At the moment, I guess I\u2019m just sort of surviving and I really don\u2019t care if I go home and he\u2019s crying about the dogs, at least right now. (LAUGHTER) But it\u2019s like a constant decision I have to make (inaudible at 00:46:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That\u2019s really hard. Well, go take your (inaudible). I think we\u2019re scheduled for next Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">CLIENT: I feel like I just got here. (LAUGHTER) Oh... (SIGH)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Do you want to come back sooner than next Tuesday? Does that make it harder or easier? (PAUSE) I just heard you say that you feel like you just got here. So if you need more time, we can schedule more time. But I don\u2019t know if that... I don\u2019t want to place a burden on you of coming extra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201ED\">CLIENT: I think next week is... Actually, I\u2019m going to have to be at the hospital next Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F1\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t want to change anything now. I want to see if I can get Josh\u2019s mom to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Okay, okay. And if you need to reschedule with me, we\u2019ll...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F5\">CLIENT: I might.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F7\">THERAPIST: ...do that. So I have you for the 12:30 on Tuesday. But there are other spaces in my week. So if you need to...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201F6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561833\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F9\">CLIENT: You know what? His clinic... We\u2019re going to have to (inaudible at 00:47:21) and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to be able to get someone to take him every time or even if I can just in case, let\u2019s move it. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FB\">THERAPIST: Okay. Friday? I have to look at next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FD\">CLIENT: Is this a slot you have in general or is this just a random opening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FF\">THERAPIST: I have this spot every other week but not every week. This is Wednesday at 3:30. Right? So I don\u2019t have this next week. But I have it the week after. Next week I have a 9:30 on Tuesday or a 10:30 or 11:30 on Friday. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20201\">CLIENT: Okay.

I\u2019m e-mail you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20207\">THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want me to put you in for the next, next Wednesday would be 3:30? Do you want me to hold that for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20209\">CLIENT: Yes. That would be perfect.
