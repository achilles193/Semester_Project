(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:06) Disappointing, isn\u2019t it?

And it\u2019s just sort of \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re just coming off your weekend with friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: So, restless but also tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve been having some really bad anxiety again. And it sort of slid into just exhaustion, I guess. I still haven\u2019t recovered. (inaudible at 00:00:42) frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: In how many ways you feeling exhausted?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (sighs) What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Physically? Emotionally? Both? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, both, I guess. Running has been feeling like so much work. I\u2019m just a drag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mmm. You were going to say \u201ctorture.\u201d (inaudible at 00:01:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s not torture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I heard you stop yourself. But a lot of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It just doesn\u2019t feel very good. And the thought of going to do things is just really a lot of work. And it might just be I\u2019ve been spending too much time with Josh in the house (inaudible at 00:01:30). I don\u2019t know. But it seems like if I\u2019m not anxious and\u2014I can\u2019t seem to find someplace <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">where it\u2019s just calm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: So, your only energy is the anxiety energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:01:41) Yeah. And I think I\u2019ve talked about this before. I\u2019m not sure how to find motivation and (ph) energy without anxiety. And I still don\u2019t know (inaudible at 00:01:49). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because it sounds like excitement or desire isn\u2019t really there anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean, it seems to be so tied to what time of the month it is, too. Which makes me feel so helpless. (chuckles) I mean, these things seem to happen together, so I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I just feel like I have no control at all. I don\u2019t know if I do or not or (inaudible at 00:02:24). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: I mean, certainly there are hormonal fluctuations that happen over the course of the\u2014your menstrual cycle. And you don\u2019t have control over those. There may be some ways that you can manage your response to them. But I think there really is a difference in how your hormones affect you. What do you notice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019ll always be more anxious the week before I get my period. And, then, feel kind of like this.  I mean, it\u2019s varying \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Really tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: degrees, I guess. Or maybe I just pay too much attention now. I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So you feel when you actually\u2014you have your period now? Or you (crosstalk at 00:03:13)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: No. This is the week after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Week after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I guess my hormones are low. When they\u2019re high, I guess I have more energy. But sometimes, that feels more (crosstalk at 00:03:23).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: But it feels like anxiety, rather than \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Well, no. It\u2019s not always. And then, there\u2019s generally a week or two in the middle where things are pretty good. I don\u2019t know. (sighs) Makes it feel even harder to manage, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mmm, yeah. Like you said, it\u2019s that not\u2014it\u2019s not really in your control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: And a lot of the times, I feel like I just work\u2014I work better if I think less about how I\u2019m feeling. Just do things that I know are good for me. And I think I\u2019ve said this before, but lately, I\u2019ve been just been thinking too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well, so, I think one of the things you said just before that was, \u201cAm I just paying too much attention?\u201d  And I think there is\u2014right, what details make sense to pay attention to and what details aren\u2019t useful to pay attention to? It\u2019s an important skill of filtering out\u2014right? Because we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">don\u2019t want to pay attention to the static.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: [Yes. Right] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: So, while paying attention to your mood and noticing what your anxiety is or noticing what you\u2019re feeling is useful, there is a degree at which it becomes redundant. You already know there\u2019s a pattern here. And if it\u2019s not a symptom that you can necessarily do something about and it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">dangerous to you, maybe we shouldn\u2019t notice it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, this past week, I\u2019ve had no schedule of any kind. And that makes it worse because I have to decide \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right. That\u2019s not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: everything I do. And then I think about how I\u2019m feeling and just\u2014it\u2019s not good. I mean, I had no meetings. Nothing getting me anywhere.  In fact, this was the reason (inaudible at 00:05:04) go to the house today. I mean, I made myself go (inaudible at 00:05:07) now, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: But knowing that you actually did have to be out probably helps you to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, yesterday I decided to work from because no one was there to hang out with Josh. And he\u2019s continuing to have a hard time. And it\u2019s just not helpful. (chuckles) And that was like four days I spent with him, basically. Just us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: In the house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, we did go out. We went out to the mall, which was huge. On Saturday. But it was pretty exhausting. And we went so that I could buy really expensive noise-canceling (inaudible at 00:05:45) so that we could sleep next to each other. Which sort of worked. I mean, it\u2019s kind of elaborate. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">noise-canceling headphones plus a fan app plus a fan and I [could sleep] (ph). (chuckles) Probably plus an Ativan, depending on if I\u2019m really worried (inaudible at 00:06:02). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">So, we left the house. But it was pretty stressful. (chuckles) And it was still just the two of us. (sighs) I don\u2019t know. And I guess I\u2019ve been thinking too much about why I\u2019m feeling this way and trying to (crosstalk at 00:06:22).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Uh huh. So that\u2019s the other piece, right? So, if you\u2019re noticing that you\u2019re feeling something, it\u2019s like\u2014if sometimes is a really good indicator that you should pay attention to fix something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: If there\u2019s a cut, you want to know so that you can fix it. But if it\u2019s chronic pain and there isn\u2019t necessarily anything to do. Old injury. Nothing to treat. Then, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to pay attention to that pain signal. And I think for you, sometimes tiredness, sometimes anxiety falls <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">into that chronic pain category, where \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:07:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: there isn\u2019t necessarily new information here or something specific you can do to alleviate it.  So, you want to ignore it. Not reinforce it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was just being really hurt by having Josh be the way he is right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, right. Because he\u2019s paying attention to all (inaudible at 00:07:21).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really hard to ignore. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah. He\u2019s hard to ignore, but you are, too. Right? So, when your signals are going off, when you feel anxious or when you feel tired, it\u2019s hard to ignore, as well. My sense would be that there\u2019s this culture in your house right now of paying attention to symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, and he\u2019s not going to help me. (chuckles) I mean, a little bit, going out of the house is helpful, but\u2014and I think I said this last time. If we go out and most of it is\u2014there\u2019s very little actual distraction, good stuff. And there are constant problems.  Pain. Troubles (ph). So, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s not so good that it makes me forget about what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot of work, too. To take him out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs) It\u2019s a lot of work. (chuckles) But I don\u2019t know. So, I come here to talk about how I\u2019m feeling. But I also shouldn\u2019t think too much about it, which I\u2019m having trouble reconciling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: You come here to discern which feelings we pay attention to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And which feelings it\u2019s safe to ignore. Or not say ignore them, but move on with them. Right? Like that tiredness. If running is feeling like\u2014you\u2019re so tired and running is feeling like way more work than it is good? I think that\u2019s important to pay attention to. And that doesn\u2019t mean you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">don\u2019t exercise, but it does mean you don\u2019t go and push yourself on an incredible run. Maybe you do let your\u2014cut your pace back so that you\u2019re running at a more relaxed pace.  Or run for less time than you normally would. So that you still get the benefit of feeling like you did something that was good <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F2\">for you, but you\u2019re honoring what your body is saying but not worrying about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s really hard, because a lot of the times, I need to just do what I know will probably help and ignore my body. And sometimes, I need to listen. And that\u2019s really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Right. And it\u2019s hard to discern when\u2014which signals mean what.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: And then, I\u2019m trying to discern that for Josh every day. Do I push him? Do I not? Is it a good idea (inaudible at 00:09:36)? Sometimes it\u2019s good. And sometimes it\u2019s bad. Or sometimes it\u2019s both. Or it\u2019s bad but it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Do you have any way of predicting which it is with him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. I mean, he will sometimes just say no. And have a good reason. . And (inaudible at 00:10:01). I won\u2019t push, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And any way to predict with yourself? Do you have a way of discerning, \u201cWhat anxiety I should listen to.\u201d \u201cWhat tiredness I should listen to.\u201d And which ones?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Well, this is why having a schedule, a more concrete schedule is great, because certain things that you have to do, will it be like a gauge? I don\u2019t know if this makes any sense. If I get to a point where I\u2019m doing the things that I have to do no matter what, without thinking about them, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">I still feel crappy, then that probably \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Then, that\u2019s something (crosstalk at 00:10:43).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Correct. Yeah, yeah. I seem to be unable to keep up anything.

Yeah. And people weren\u2019t around. I mean, even just the fact that I went to the gym this morning. I made myself go, even though it was halfway through the morning already and I was\u2014it was a huge struggle. There were people there doing all their (ph) things. Even just that was helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Mmm.

Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: So, according to your own rubric, then, that\u2019s a thing you pay attention to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: So, does it feel different than\u2014so, last time I talked to you, you had just come out that weekend. Your friends were visiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: And one of the things that was making feel\u2014wonder if you were crazy was they were able to lay around on the couch and enjoy relaxing and sleeping in and you were\u2014felt like you were going crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: How\u2019s that? How does that compare to what you\u2019re feeling now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Oh. The complete opposite. I just want to lay on the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Now you do. Would it be relaxing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: I think so. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So, how\u2019d you get from one place\u2014from such two different places? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: I have no idea.

It could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: I mean, I\u2019ve always wanted to crash, like when I stay up and don\u2019t sleep for a like a week at a time. (inaudible at 00:13:19) get really upset sometimes, reading romance novels or whatever I like to read, where something crazy happens and then they just crash. I\u2019ve never been able to just do <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">that. I\u2019m wondering if I should be happy that I\u2019m feeling this way, because maybe this is my body deciding it does need to rest, instead of just continuing to be . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I think it is, probably, your body\u2019s decision, telling you that you need to rest. Either from coming off of that week where you really felt really restless and keyed-up or maybe it is because of where you are in your cycle. And it\u2019s a natural time for your body to crash. But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">think the goal is so that you don\u2019t have to have a week of feeling frenzied and restless and keyed-up and so anxious that you think you\u2019re crazy.  And then, have the crash as relaxation, because I don\u2019t think\u2014crashing is not really relaxing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: No. I\u2019ve been doing this a lot, up and down, up and down. And (inaudible at 00:14:18) normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And you think, really, our goal is to have a little bit more stability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t know what I can hope for with Josh the way he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. What can you hope for you (inaudible at 00:14:30), and then, you\u2019re not really on your own. He\u2019s being in the system that you\u2019re in also has a real impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Right. I mean, it would be hard enough to keep myself normal anyway. I know that\u2019s pretty normal for most of my friends. Keeping yourself in a good place is just hard. (crosstalk at 00:15:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

It\u2019s very chaotic. And you can, right, not come in and work on your own?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And it makes it hard that there\u2019s not a lot of external structure imposed upon you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Ugh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And the structure is part of what keeps you consistent. Having that schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: I mean, even Josh\u2019s mom coming to work at our place while I went to school has been sort of a schedule, in a way, because I know I can\u2019t come home and give up at like 3:00 because (ph) she\u2019ll be there and she\u2014and it will mess up her day. And I\u2019ve been a little bit frustrated, that I feel like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t be in your own house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t come home when I want to. But then, it also keeps from giving up.  But she hasn\u2019t been able to come in like a week. (chuckles) So, even an aggravating little\u2014I mean, it\u2019s been frustrating, but also helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. The limitations (inaudible at 00:16:15) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: it\u2019s aggravating. But actually having that boundary is (ph) good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Right. Right. Right. (crosstalk at 00:16:25)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: When might that be put back in place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It sounds like something odd is going on. I have to talk to Josh more about it. I think she\u2019s maybe starting to get some pushback from work or something. I\u2019m not sure exactly. He hasn\u2019t been super-talkative in the past few days, so I don\u2019t know. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Are there other things that can put some external limits on you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Or [can you] (ph) create them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been thinking about what can I do.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a pretty delicate balance right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of things to do that should be exciting enough (ph) to keep\u2014to make me get out of the house. But I don\u2019t know.

Yeah, by feeling pulled in the other direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, even working at home yesterday, he was constantly needing something. So I could never quite focus. And (inaudible at 00:18:01).  It was just really tiring, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It seems draining to constantly be pulled in two directions and responsible for such an important thing. I mean, your work is really important. And taking care of him is really important.

And doesn\u2019t like being alone. I mean, I felt terrible yesterday. I had my noise-canceling headphones on and he was having muscle cramps and then freaking out. And I couldn\u2019t hear him. He texted me. (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201191\">I felt my phone buzz so I could hear him. I mean, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I feel mostly, I have to keep myself separate from him, because he\u2019s got so much need that I can\u2019t always \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: And you can\u2019t fill that.

I mean, I think I\u2019ve said this before, but it stinks that I need to just keep us separate in some way. Either if it\u2019s just go to school every day or go out with my friends more often or what.

It sounds like a\u2014any thought that life might be like it is now long-term is pretty terrifying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: I mean, it\u2019s not terrifying. I mean, it just makes me so (ph) tired, I guess. (chuckles) It\u2019s depressing. And I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Life is hard right now. You don\u2019t want it to be hard forever. Being able to be hopeful about a better future is pretty important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: I mean, Josh also spends a whole lot of time dreaming about all the things he\u2019s going to do once he gets his transplant.  (sighs) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to watch, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: What makes it hard for you to watch that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: I guess I can\u2019t imagine\u2014I think I said this before. I can\u2019t imagine him keeping that up for six months or however \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: Dreaming about the future?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a long time to dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: It is. I wonder if that\u2019s what keeps him going, is being able to dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: Probably. I mean, probably. For sure. He definitely does not react in any of the same ways that I do [to things] (ph). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. You have very different responses to thinking about the\u2014a better future. I wonder what you response is about. What the nausea or the fear really means for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I guess the thought of walking around in an engagement ring, and then having everyone ask about how excited I am would just feel really false.  Because, I mean, even this morning, the people at the gym know Josh, because he used to go there. And he sold them the bikes. And one <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201611\">of them asked\u2014people always ask in a relatively (ph) positive way. \u201cSo, is he getting better? Is he doing better? Is he getting stronger?\u201d Which is different than, \u201cHow are you (ph) doing?\u201d Which, then, I usually respond with, \u201cHe\u2019s holding on,\u201d or\u2014I mean, he\u2019s not doing great (chuckles) so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. That feels like there\u2019s a\u2014those questions are hard, because there\u2019s\u2014people want to hear that he\u2019s doing better. It\u2019s clear with those kinds of questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20162-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20162-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: Right. I mean, I don\u2019t really want to\u2014I don\u2019t even want to really talk about the whole pain problem, which is probably [just going to be] (ph) problem forever. It doesn\u2019t make sense to either of us. Just a really confusing, ongoing problem.  And it also stinks to tell someone, \u201cOh, well, he\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201651\">in a lot of pain.\u201d (chuckles) I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: Because people don\u2019t know how to respond.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, I guess if you add a ring on top of that and telling everybody about a wedding and planning a wedding, it\u2019s just\u2014I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">THERAPIST: What you\u2019re experiencing is\u2014you\u2019re imagining that what you\u2019d be experiencing is so different from what people are imagining or wanting you to experience.

I mean, I get asked questions and (inaudible at 00:27:38) kind all the time. I usually just ignore it. Brush it off (crosstalk at 00:27:43). Because I\u2019m not sure I can do that at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I can see that there\u2019s\u2014imagining that if you were wearing a ring, that there\u2019d be all these assumptions. Right? Pretty typical responses.  Asking about, \u201cOh, when\u2019s the wedding? Have you set a date?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: Those are pretty common responses to seeing somebody with a new engagement ring. And that would be a lot of assumption to (inaudible at 00:28:13) up to, because your own\u2014what your experience of it might be very different than the typical engagement and wedding planning process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess it all feels so meaningless, too. I mean, this ring that\u2019s supposed to be happy, but\u2014we\u2019re pretty committed. Putting a ring on top of it just feels faker or more false, for some reason, in a way. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: What feels false about it?

Sometimes it\u2019s hard to put words to what you\u2019re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: Are there other places you feel false or is it only in regard to your relationship with Josh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t know, I guess, because when people asked me, I\u2019ve stopped saying anything. I\u2019ll say whatever it is that\u2019s happening. Which is nice. I mean, I still feel uncomfortable doing it. I don\u2019t know. Last night, my brother and his friend came over to talk to Josh about medicinal marijuana. (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201951\">We just keep asking the doctors about it, because they keep trying to take him off drugs. They\u2019re addictive.  Anyway, my brother just said he would come over because his friend has panic attacks, I guess. And has a medicinal marijuana card or whatever for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">But anyway, so, I was talking. And I barely know my brother\u2019s roommate. I mean, I know him a little bit. And we started talking about not Josh (chuckles) but about his major\u2014I guess he (inaudible at 00:30:23) depression and anxiety and panic attacks. I know it sounds horrible, but I started just pouring <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201971\">out all this stuff to him. I don\u2019t know. He seemed okay with, but it was \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20196-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20196-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: Mmm.

I mean, maybe he was\u2014he left, and he was like, \u201cWhoa.\u201d Definitely felt a little inappropriate. It was really nice, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Ah. So, it felt nice to be able to be really honest and be open and not hold back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 00:30:23) my brother\u2014well, my brother finally, I don\u2019t feel bad about just spilling out my guts to him. But his poor friend. I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Well, I think it speaks to how overwhelmed you feel. And the needs you have that aren\u2019t being met. Right? Because when there was an opportunity to connect with someone and to unburden yourself a bit, it came really easily to do that. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But I do think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A11\">it\u2019s telling that you did it with someone that you wouldn\u2019t have chosen for it to be your brother\u2019s roommate, who you don\u2019t know really well. So, that\u2019s a sign to pay attention to, right? That when you had an opportunity to relieve yourself in that way, you took it. And it\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A12\">opportunity to do it in a place that you would feel even safer.  Or with a person with whom you felt really safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean, I was actually dying to tell one of my friends at school today about the whole engagement ring thing. But that requires, I feel, a different\u2014I don\u2019t want to do that in my office (inaudible at 00:30:23).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so there\u2019s (inaudible at 00:30:23).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A7\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:23) about that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s stuff you\u2019re hanging onto that doesn\u2019t (inaudible at 00:30:23) to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AB\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AD\">THERAPIST: And I think because you don\u2019t feel like Josh can help you with a lot of the stuff that you normally talk to him about, there\u2019s more stuff built up that you\u2019re hanging onto that doesn\u2019t really have a place to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201AF\">CLIENT: Right. And right now, it\u2019s making very tired, as opposed to anxious. And I don\u2019t know why that happens. But \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B1\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it\u2019s just where the limit is. Right? Over a certain amount, it feels overwhelming and draining. And maybe before you hit that limit, it feels anxiety-producing in a more energizing way.  It could be about how much stuff, how long you\u2019ve held onto it. Or it could be about\u2014in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B11\">certain part of your cycle. The overwhelming feels energizing. And in another part of your cycle, it hits you differently. I don\u2019t know which side it comes from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B3\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. No, I guess it\u2019s the heart transplant was so big that it wasn\u2019t anxiety-producing anymore. It just shifted everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Mmm. You get resigned to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, in a way, there are some good things about that. Too many little things are\u2014what am I trying to say? I feel like I\u2019ve said this before, but in a more positive way. It\u2019s like having a problem that\u2019s so big, you have to completely change everything. It can be (ph) better than having <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201B71\">little problems that just cause some (ph) anxiety that\u2019s not helping.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.

But when the crisis isn\u2019t so overwhelming that you\u2019re just in the moment, dealing with it, you get in your head. Which feels really uncomfortable for you, right? (inaudible at 00:34:15) in your head, worried <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201C11\">about stuff feels worse for you than mobilized to deal in the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">CLIENT: Right. But if I\u2019m not in my head worrying or mobilized, I\u2019m just anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:34:28) often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Or applying to grad school. Or some goal that I had to do certain things to get to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DD\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you still have goals?

Or asked for a leave of absence (crosstalk at 00:35:56). (chuckles) Contemplating the end too much.  I don\u2019t know. I mean, this is also another reason to have a schedule. Part of the goal, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Is to give yourself some autopilot again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E7\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Right?

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F9\">THERAPIST: So, I think something like that, the schedules that you\u2019ve attempted to set up in the past are too stringent. Right? And then, if you said something like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the office every day,\u201d you miss it once, and now your schedule has failed. So, what if we set something that was more <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201F91\">doable? Like I\u2019m going to get out of the house five times this week? Give yourself some structure, but a more flexible structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it makes me feel so bad about myself that I want someone to make me do things. It feels really sad. (chuckles) (inaudible at 00:37:43)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">THERAPIST: You want to be internally motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">THERAPIST: If it works, it might get there. This might be a step toward that. My hope would be that if you can have someone to be accountable to and you can get out of the house and you can start interacting and having a little bit more consistency, it will feel good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">THERAPIST: And then, that feeling good will be the more internal motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">THERAPIST: But we have to start somewhere. Or restart somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I mean, scheduling meetings with my advisor, it could be a good idea, except that he\u2019s not consistently available, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">THERAPIST: Right.

Which would\u2019ve been good if it had happened. But he was out of town. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve thought about asking a friend or two at school, but none of the people I work directly near have any kind of a schedule, either, so (chuckles) . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20215\">THERAPIST: But could they have\u2014so, they might not have a consistent schedule, but could you set up something like on Wednesday, let\u2019s get together at such-and-such a time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20217\">CLIENT: Oh. Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20219\">THERAPIST: And so have that be a one-day. And then, me be another day. And advisor maybe one day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that could be helpful (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021D\">THERAPIST: And maybe that\u2019s enough. What would be reasonable? Getting out three days a week? Getting out four? Getting out two?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021F\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20221\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s reasonable? Because every day is not reasonable right now, I don\u2019t think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20223\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, one day not leaving the house is almost already too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20225\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:39:46)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20227\">CLIENT: Maybe just one day a week where I don\u2019t make it out is okay, but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20229\">THERAPIST: Okay. But any more than that feels horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I used to kind of dread the weekends, because Pat would be there the whole weekend.  But I still kind of dread them, because there\u2019s nowhere to be. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022D\">THERAPIST: Okay. So, then, it sounds like getting out six days a week, even if the getting out\u2014it doesn\u2019t necessarily all need to be work-related, but it needs to be getting out. Because it sounds like staying home is not good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2022F\">CLIENT: No. That\u2019s the problem. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20231\">THERAPIST: Does getting out to do grocery shopping on your own, does that suffice for helping you to feel like part of the world and productive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20233\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Josh, even one of the days when I was going to go grocery shopping, and then, he\u2019s discovered an app where they\u2019ll do grocery shopping for you. And all he does, basically, is cook, play his Xbox, and occasionally do a little bit of work. So, I don\u2019t want to take his\u2014he\u2019s so excited <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202331\">to have control over groceries, because of this app. (chuckles) Anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20232-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20232-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">THERAPIST: So, you don\u2019t want to take that away. But another errand you could have. Because I think getting up\u2014just scheduling it to be work six days a week I\u2019m a little leery of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. I mean, I have to say, the dogs have been helpful to have (crosstalk at 00:41:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">THERAPIST: Ah. They\u2019re back home permanently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because they always need to go out. And that\u2019s always a reason to go outside, like you said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">THERAPIST: And take a walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t always end up being very (inaudible at 00:41:28). (chuckles) Ugh. And also, I think that maybe right after I last saw you or towards the end of feeling really anxious and keyed-up, I also started to feel really angry. The same kind of\u2014if I saw some\u2014I would get into a fight in a parking <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F1\">lot or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20241\">(sighs) And then even just taking the dogs for a run, because it was so much work, made me so angry. So, it\u2019s part of my wondering if my hormones are just uncontrollable. And I\u2019m just not meant to function at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20243\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think many people are meant to function under these circumstances for very long. Or function without feeling badly. You\u2019re functioning. There are some consequences to it. You don\u2019t feel well a lot of the time. How\u2019s the keyboard process going? You were in the process of seeing if <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202431\">that was something you could from (ph) mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20245\">CLIENT: Yeah, so, I can\u2019t get one from her. But I have decided to sell a bunch of stuff to make space for it. So, I put some up on Craig\u2019s List, which is really a disheartening thing to do because Craig\u2019s List is really (chuckles) frustrating. Because I\u2019m really excited to get rid of some stuff. Sell <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202451\">some things. Replace it with a keyboard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20247\">THERAPIST: Because that might be a way of feeling\u2014for times when you\u2019re at home, I wonder if using that would be something that would help you feel productive. Give you an outlet for some of these feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20249\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs) I mean, I think I was telling you a little bit my reckless spending. And then, Josh is also\u2014we keep both trying to buy things that we think will help, like these noise-cancelling headphones. And he\u2019s been buying all sorts of exercise contraptions to try to do a little bit of exercise <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202491\">at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Looking for something to fix some of what\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And if I didn\u2019t buy the really expensive headphones on Saturday, I might\u2019ve just bought a keyboard, but that ended up coming first. Actually, that\u2019s when I decided to sell some stuff. (crosstalk at 00:43:37) stop, just (sighs) I mean, this has always been something that\u2014Josh would be any <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2024D1\">supplement he thought would help, really. (inaudible at 00:43:49) just to feel more harmful than helpful. I still think the keyboard\u2019s really helpful (inaudible at 00:43:57). (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2024F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re explaining why your process of selling to buy. Yeah. That\u2019s going to make you feel like you\u2019re doing something responsible. And that\u2019s okay. I do think that the desire to want to buy something that\u2019s going to fix is so understandable. Especially when you both feel so out-of-control <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2024F1\">and helpless to be able to control what\u2019s going on with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20251\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20252\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20253\">THERAPIST: And any behavior, doing things is going to be more helpful for you than stuff. Stuff isn\u2019t going to fix it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20252-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20252-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561841\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20254\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20255\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20256\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20257\">THERAPIST: Playing music is a good coping technique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20259\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025B\">THERAPIST: You need something to play on. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2025E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2025F\">THERAPIST: So, figuring out a way to do that makes sense. But I think it\u2019s not the buying that\u2019s going to make you feel good. It\u2019s having something as another outlet that\u2019s going to, I think, be a positive impact on how you manage being limited.  It\u2019s harder to go out and have a consistent schedule <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2025F1\">by having a lot of emotions that you can\u2019t talk about him\u2014you can\u2019t talk about with him right now. Music can be a healthy outlet for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20260\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20261\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20262\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20263\">THERAPIST: And (inaudible at 00:45:24) the other thing we talked about was getting your Silly Putty or your Play-Doh out. It\u2019s a way to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20264\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20265\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess not too long after I last talked to you, I needed a whole different set of coping mechanisms, because the anxiety went away and was replaced \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20266\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20267\">THERAPIST: (crosstalk at 00:45:39) tired \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20268\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20269\">CLIENT: more like this (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026B\">THERAPIST: You might not need something to relieve your (inaudible at 00:45:46). Because I think it comes from the same place. My guess is, is that the feeling tired is hiding from being overwhelmed. And the anxiety is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2026E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2026F\">THERAPIST: is just maybe a different way of experiencing it.  Because I think it is feeling overwhelmed with your responsibilities and somewhat helpless in being able to meet all of the different things that you\u2019re being called to meet. Even though it feels really different, I\u2019m not sure that the <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2026F1\">coping with it is necessarily that different. When you feel exhausted, it still might\u2014I wonder what would happen if you took out the Silly Putty and played with it and broke it and smooshed it and formed it into things. How that would change what you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s certainly not going to be harmful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20270\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20271\">I think trying it out and seeing how it impacts your feelings, where it takes you to. The idea is just to move to a different place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20272\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20273\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20274\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20275\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re feeling really anxious, you want to move to a place where you feel calmer. When you\u2019re feeling exhausted and drained, you want to move to a place where you feel more calm, right? Calm is different than exhausted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20276\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20277\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Well, that is something else that I can be or\u2014I don\u2019t know about why that made me think of exercising. Or even I guess yoga can make me feel calm but not exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20278\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20279\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:47:18) I think the goal is always to find a way to help yourself manage whatever you\u2019re feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2027B\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2027D\">THERAPIST: The goal is always for you to feel calm, grounded, good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2027F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20281\">THERAPIST: The same techniques might get you there, regardless of where you\u2019re starting from.
