(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You seem surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: No, I guess today I\u2019m feeling sort of contemplative. I don\u2019t know. I just had friends in town this weekend. And decided to ignore basically what I would do if they weren\u2019t there to sleep and (chuckles) take care of myself. And just take the consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What were the consequences?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Oh, that I\u2019m (chuckles) exhausted. Or I slept last night, but that I was really, really tired. I don\u2019t know. Which, I guess, made me think a lot about whether all of my troubles are\u2014sometimes they feel like bad habits. Sometimes, it feels like an illness, almost.  I don\u2019t know. One of Josh\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">friends who was here has a deformed foot and he\u2019ll just never be able to run on it or\u2014there\u2019s a lot of things he\u2014it\u2019s a very clear limitation. No matter who\u2019s doing what, he just cannot do some things. Or, I mean, sometimes, it really makes me think if I\u2019m doing something wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">We were relaxing on Sunday. (chuckles) Meaning lying around on the couch. And I was having a lot of trouble just laying there. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Not relaxing for you at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Well, I recognize that it should be. I was very tired. There wasn\u2019t anything else I really wanted to be doing. I just was really \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What do you feel when you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: My heart is pounding. I almost feel a little nauseous. And laying there is just really hard. And I was really tired, so, it wasn\u2019t like I wanted to get up and go running or something. I was just still, I don\u2019t know, worked-up from the weekend.  (sighs) I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">I mean, that happens a lot, where I\u2019m\u2014want to be laying there \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mmm, (crosstalk at 00:02:10).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: relaxing, but I just can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re so anxious that it\u2019s not relaxing. Because the heart-pounding feeling is anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, there\u2019s been a couple situations where I had no choice but to relax for like three or four days. And by the end of it, sometimes, my body will give up and actually relax. And it\u2019s great, which makes me (crosstalk at 00:02:33).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Did you try taking a Klonopin to see if you could actually allow your body to relax in that situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, last night, I took an Ativan. And, yeah, it really\u2014well, so, the Zoloft helps. (chuckles) God, I mean, I hadn\u2019t (inaudible at 00:02:51) it was awful. I\u2019d been waiting for them to get up, because, of course, I wake up early and they (inaudible at 00:02:55) sleep until noon, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">we\u2019re tired. And that\u2019s what people do when they\u2019re tired is they sleep.  (chuckles) So, I\u2019d been waiting for them to have brunch that I could have Zoloft. I don\u2019t know. I just have always woken up so early whenever there\u2019s a sleepover situation my whole life. And it always sucks in the morning. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">always makes me feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me. Especially since I wish I was sleeping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">So, anyway, so, the Zoloft, once I took it, helped a little. Not as much as Ativan does. So, yes, it does. It makes it go away. And then, I could just be\u2014still sit there and it\u2019s not a super-uncomfortable . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being chained to the couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I don\u2019t know why. If I\u2019ve done something wrong, if it\u2019s something inevitable, like a deformed ankle that I just can\u2019t do anything about. Or if I live differently, would this happen? (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just so frustrating to be relaxing when everyone else think they\u2019re having <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">a great, relaxing time, I\u2019m suffering. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Right. And you\u2019re like, \u201cThis sucks.\u201d (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: To lay there. It happens a lot. Really a lot, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: What would feel better for you? I mean, like you said, you didn\u2019t\u2014it\u2014you were tired, so it wasn\u2019t like you wanted to go out and take a run or there was something else you were really wanting to do. But clearly, it wouldn\u2019t be what you were doing if you were on your own. What would you have done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I probably would\u2019ve cleaned the house or something. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. I mean, the first morning, I made muffins, which was a little bit helpful. But I was really tired. And I could\u2019ve just gone, laid on the couch while everyone was lying around. But I made muffins, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">instead, so . . . (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Which feels less incongruent with what your body was doing, because you\u2019re up and moving. It distracts you a little bit from \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m sure if I laid back down in the middle of making muffins, I would\u2019ve felt the same way. It\u2019s just then I don\u2019t have to think or listen it.  Or feel it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Right. It distracts you. Being busy distracts you from the tense feelings inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s like when I come in here and I don\u2019t even know, because I\u2019ve been running around and then calmed down and realized that I was feeling that way. And it\u2019s horrible, so . . . I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think I look at it as somewhere in between the physical limitation of having a disability, like a foot that\u2019s not properly functioning, and lifestyle. You haven\u2019t done something wrong. I think, in some ways, your body just does operate at a higher rev than \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: maybe somebody else. So, when you try to be still, you notice that your notice that your engine is revving pretty high and you\u2019re feeling really anxious. I think where the difference is if your bones are in a certain configuration, they\u2019re in a certain configuration.  And that\u2019s it. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">not much you\u2019re going to do short of a cast or surgery to change that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: With anxiety, it\u2019s a little bit more malleable. So, you do have some control over slowing your heart rate down. Lowering your blood pressure. Things like deep breathing and yoga and even how you\u2019re thinking can have some impact on those things. But are you going to be the most laid-back, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">chill person ever through use of those techniques?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: (chuckles) No. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think so. (chuckles) I don\u2019t think you have that much control. But I do think it is somewhat malleable. And lifestyle changes help you to adapt to it. And when somebody else comes in and you have visitors and they alter your schedule or the expectation of what a day looks like changes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">that\u2019s going to be hard for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Another thing that made me think about this is that the friends have been having a lot of a trouble having a baby.  And they had three miscarriages. (chuckles) And we stayed up\u2014I was going to go to sleep earlier on Saturday night, and then, she just started telling us all this stuff about how <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">traumatizing and awful it\u2019s been until like 2:00 in the morning. And she was really worked-up and got really upset, which made me feel\u2014we\u2019re so worked-up and upset, because they\u2014it\u2019s something they\u2019ve been hiding from everyone. I also know how much that stinks. (chuckles) And that almost kept me up <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200552\">when I went to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah, (crosstalk at 00:07:33).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Just feeling so anguished and, then, she sleeps until noon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Well, she unloaded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Right. But even if I\u2019d unloaded, it would still take me a while to calm down. That doesn\u2019t happen to her. She just doesn\u2019t have this response to these crazed\u2014I mean, her\u2014she was going a mile a minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And then she just [was done] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: How could you not be all worked-up? She was. Right. And she just went to sleep. (chuckles) And that makes me feel like I have a problem.  That\u2019s something\u2019s wrong. Why can she do that and I can\u2019t? Especially with something that\u2019s really awful. She was describing these three miscarriages. (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">at 00:08:14) have a baby, and all these tests that she\u2019s been taking. She spent like $10,000 on all this stuff. I mean, that would cause me major trouble. (sighs) So . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And then, she was able to turn it off. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: And in some ways, yes. I think it\u2019s clear that you do have an anxiety disorder. And so, something is wrong. It\u2019s not something that you\u2019ve done wrong to respond that way. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re not\u2014it\u2019s not that you could change something that you\u2019re doing and fix it completely. You have room <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">to work with it. But, yeah, I mean, your body respond to anxiety different and holds lots of it than hers or maybe somebody else\u2019s.  And it just part of something that you have to work around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: But when I work around it, do I think of it\u2014so, it\u2019s something I can never think about just getting rid of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I think there\u2019s hope that you could have it so well-controlled that it wouldn\u2019t interfere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s always going to be managed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s always going to\u2014but you\u2019re not going to be able to\u2014I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s realistic that you can forget about it and not have any awareness of the choices that you\u2019re making, because you\u2019re\u2014those choices will probably have an impact. But could it be\u2014could you have it under such <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">good control that it doesn\u2019t interfere with your life? Yeah. But like with a diabetic, it doesn\u2019t have to get in your way, but you can\u2019t forget about it and eat all of your Halloween treats in one night if you\u2019re a diabetic kid. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: You just can\u2019t. That\u2019s going to have a consequence. But does it have to get in the way of your life and make you think that you\u2019re doing something wrong? No. But you\u2019re going to have to space out your Halloween treats in a little bit of a different way.  Or take more insulin if you\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">to binge on candy. So, you are going to have to keep an awareness of, yes, staying up until 2:00 a.m. for you is probably going to throw off your sleep schedule. You might bounce back a little bit differently than someone who\u2019s never had problems with sleep. And lying around on the couch until noon <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200732\">is probably going to feel different for you, maybe, than someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: Well, and especially things that, if I told someone, they\u2019d be like, \u201cThat sounds great.\u201d (chuckles) Most people think that sounds awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: But it doesn\u2019t. I mean, when you feel like you don\u2019t have the choice. You\u2019d like to be able to make the choice to totally have a chill day and be able to relax into it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019ve never really\u2014I don\u2019t know.

Although, when I think about it, my entire childhood \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been around for a very long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been around. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. People\u2019s, I guess, not like controlling needs or something, but\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not something that people talk about. So, who knows? Maybe my friend was also miserable with not being able to do what she wanted. I don\u2019t know. She wouldn\u2019t say so, probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Because I know I\u2019m going to have to really work hard to have fun. Just don\u2019t. (chuckles) So taken aback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah, but that sounds different than what they think when they\u2019re looking forward to a trip or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s certainly\u2014definitely not a normal reaction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: How did this weekend feel? I mean, so, it was frustrating to notice that you were not enjoying a sleeping-in the way that they were. But the other time with them, did that feel like you were working hard to enjoy them or was it genuinely \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: No. I mean, they made us \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: enjoyable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: They made us feel really taken care of. I mean, they had no expectations. They cooked for us. Just listening to Josh for a long time, talk about everything. And Josh\u2019s friend sat and played video games with him like all day. And me and the girl went and took a walk. I mean, it was very enjoyable. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">Except for the\u2014I couldn\u2019t handle my schedule being thrown amok. (crosstalk at 00:12:56) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mmm, right. So, do you notice the contrast (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I have a big problem. (chuckles) So, I mean, we were\u2014it was a very uplifting thing.  Which is why I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not really upset about not having been able to sleep. It\u2019s just sort of sad, because the weekend would\u2019ve been a lot better had I been able to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: What do you think it would\u2019ve taken for you to be able to sleep in a scenario where your schedule is a little bit thrown off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a\u2014if I\u2019m going to stay up until 2:00 a.m. listening to this girl\u2019s problems, because we\u2019re having a very support-each-other time. It is what it is. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way, unless I wake up in the middle of the night and take an Ambien at\u2014no, I mean, I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">done that, actually. At like 3:00 a.m. and it doesn\u2019t make a difference. (chuckles) The only thing that\u2019s gotten me to get any extra sleep is Ativan. So, maybe. But, still, it would just\u2014it took me out for so long. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: I mean, you really didn\u2019t feel like you could\u2019ve put a boundary on that discussion.  And have it end sooner. It was really important to listen and be there. That that was (crosstalk at 00:14:05).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it was worth it, for sure. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: How long did it take you to fall asleep when\u2014once the conversation was over?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. A little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Did you ever fall asleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: I did. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: But a while, because I just couldn\u2019t\u2014I\u2014it was an intense conversation. (chuckles) Took a while to come down from\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014yeah (inaudible at 00:14:27) clock. I don\u2019t know. A little while. And I was really tired. And it always happens. I\u2019ll be really tired, I\u2019ll be like, \u201cI can\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">And then, I\u2019ll get in bed. And then, I\u2019ll still just be as if I was still in the conversation for, I don\u2019t know, half-an-hour, an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: It feels like a long time when you\u2019re lying there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, that\u2014I mean, I have definitely reconciled myself to the consequences. So, I wasn\u2019t freaking out about that. I wasn\u2019t going to sleep. I mean, it was also nice that (inaudible at 00:14:59) we had no expectations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: The next day. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: I mean, they\u2019re a couple we used to go and sleep on their couch and go for bike rides. Five-hour bike rides. And then, go out to a bar or something. (chuckles) Somehow, I used to be able to do those things. And I would never sleep very much. I had more energy reserves. I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">Yeah. (inaudible at 00:15:26) stayed in our pajamas for like half a day, so, it didn\u2019t matter. I just felt crappy. (inaudible at 00:15:34) my parents came over last night to drop off some things for Josh. And I was just non-functional. I couldn\u2019t even answer their questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You were really wiped out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: To the point where, I mean, I was almost worried about driving my friends to the airport. (chuckles) I kept dropping things. I kept forgetting things.  I mean, there were definitely points when I hadn\u2019t slept for like a whole week where I didn\u2019t even want to bike to school, because I was afraid <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">I would fall over. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: That feels scary when you feel that out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s when I know it\u2019s a really bad point, when I\u2019m not\u2014clearly not functioning at all. Why would my body want this to happen<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Right. Well, it doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: And we were talking about why would your\u2014when you get a new heart, your body could live forever if it just let it be there instead of attacking it. Anything. Any autoimmune disease or anything where your body just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Right. It doesn\u2019t seem to make sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Right. Which also makes me think about why would my body want to do these things to me when it\u2019s not helping anyone. It\u2019s not making me healthier. It\u2019s making me unhealthy. (sighs) Which, then, makes me feel like I have a disease. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, I think your body does it with more intention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Sure. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Right?  I mean, there is intentionality in it, the thought process makes sense. But it doesn\u2019t realize. I mean, what your body is doing, except it\u2019s not in the right scenario. So, I mean, that heart-racing feeling makes a lot of sense. There is no threat that your body is responding to. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">it\u2019s when you\u2019re anxious. It\u2019s like your body is responding as the way it would as if there were some sort of threat.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">THERAPIST: But, in the same way, just like an autoimmune disease. Right? Your body\u2019s responding in the way that there\u2019s some sort of bacteria or something that it\u2019s gearing up to fight. But there\u2019s no virus. There are no bacteria. It\u2019s not fighting anything except itself. But it\u2019s normal, typical responses, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">just at the wrong time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: I always think of the fight-or-flight thing that was something that\u2019s quick. Because I could feel like that for days. I mean, why doesn\u2019t it go away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Right. And it still is that fight-or-flight thing. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s doing that in a prolonged way.  And that\u2019s part of why\u2014and that\u2019s why we say, okay, this is crossing the line from a normal anxiety response to calling it an anxiety disorder, because it\u2019s continuing to prepare as if there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">some sort of ongoing threat. And there isn\u2019t one. And there maybe never was even one. Sometimes, it\u2019s set. You\u2019re anxious about something that makes sense to be anxious about. But then, that kind of time goes away and the response doesn\u2019t. And so, you\u2019re left feeling anxious about something that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD2\">could\u2019ve been done with days ago. Or you\u2019re responding to nothing at all. You don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re feeling anxious, but your body is going through those motions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">And then, the exhaustion makes sense, because it\u2019s the coming-down effect. But you\u2019re having it in such an intense way that it feels like exhaustion rather than just coming down from that peak of anxiety. When your body shoots out all that cortisol and adrenaline and all of that that it uses when it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">gets revved up \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: and there\u2019s\u2014you have hormones that counter that, to help calm everything down. And that\u2019s what makes you feel so exhausted. It\u2019s too much of that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: I feel like I may not have enough of that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Mmm. In the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Why do I have to try so hard to calm down? I have to work really hard. (chuckles) Even just to bring it down like a level. After, I think, (inaudible at 00:19:29) running, just sitting on the couch, I start to feel a little more comfortable. But it would take me like two seconds to go right back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Mmm. When you say you\u2019re working really hard to bring it down, what do you\u2014what is the\u2014what\u2019s the work? What do you do to get yourself that little bit of relief?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Well, not jumping up and freaking out. So, just trying to stay put, which is hard. (chuckles) (inaudible at 00:19:52) to do that. To try to breathe deeply and slowly. (sighs) I think that\u2019s about all. Just trying to keep up breathe and stay put. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: What if you fought it less? What if you got up and paced around?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Because I was so tired I just wanted to relax. Because I guess I was mad. I wanted to relax. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Anger doesn\u2019t really help here. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Right, right. And that would make me feel crazy, if I got up and started pacing around. I didn\u2019t want to be crazy. I wanted to relax. So, and I guess maybe I was just being a little irrational because I was so tired. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s hard to think rationally when you\u2019re tired. And it\u2019s what you want\u2014what you want to want is different than what you actually want.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yes. For sure. I don\u2019t know. I guess maybe I was being stubborn. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. I wonder if you compromised with yourself if you\u2019d get to that place faster. So, if there was some compromise between getting up and racing around the house and cleaning, which may fit with the restlessness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Something between that and forcing yourself to lie still on the couch.  And, \u201cDamn it, I\u2019m going to relax.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Which seems so not relaxing. Is there an in-between? Is there a gentle activity you could do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F5\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s hard when there are other people there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Can you sit and knit or cross-stitch or something that\u2019s not racing around, but also not completely chilling. Crossword puzzles. Would that be enough of something to distract you a little bit, but still be calm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Would doing something like that feel\u2014help you feel more in-line with other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">CLIENT: Probably. I tried knitting once. I was really bad at it, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: But making a beautiful product would not be the point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: Sure. Right.  I mean, I was really bad at it because sitting and knitting is \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:06) still. It was still too still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">CLIENT: Well, but maybe at that point, it would\u2019ve been something good to do. I forgot about my Silly Putty, which I do have. I should\u2019ve gotten my Silly Putty and . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Just having that. Allowing you to be restless in a little bit of a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Having something to play with with your hands. All of the things I suggested are all about a way to have something to do but still allows, for the most part, your body to be still. To me, it seems like that plays with the compromise of you clearly have this nervous energy going on, so, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">feel like we need to be\u2014to honor that. That\u2019s there. We can\u2019t fight it. But if the main goal is to be\u2014feel like\u2014emotionally feel like you\u2019re fitting in with everybody else and physically actually giving your body, your gross motor, you\u2019re giving it a rest.  Right? The big stuff. And you\u2019d still be able <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B2\">to release some of the fidgety energy in smaller ways. By playing with Silly Putty, playing with a bouncy ball, or doing a crossword or Sudoku or . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Those would\u2019ve all been helpful. I\u2019m still working on getting a piano. That might\u2019ve been a little much for the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. A little harder to fit in with the other\u2014with the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">CLIENT: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s not always . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: But that (inaudible at 00:23:32) the same idea. I think I had knitting stuff from college. I just threw it away, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: It does seem like a good\u2014it would\u2019ve been a good thing to have yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, see what\u2019s easiest of those types of things, so that you don\u2019t have to invest in a whole new project. And maybe just seeing what it\u2019s like to give yourself a small out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was really, hard, too, because Josh was saying how relaxed I look or looked or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (inaudible at 00:24:14)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">CLIENT: Because I was trying to close my eyes. And telling me how I was obviously asleep or something. (chuckles) I blew up at him. I was like, \u201cI was dying. You don\u2019t even know.\u201d Oh, because I had asked him if\u2014because I thought maybe watching a movie would be\u2014I don\u2019t know. It seemed like something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201211\">(inaudible at 00:24:33) up. I don\u2019t know. So, I had suggested that. And we all sat on the couch (inaudible at 00:24:38) hanging out. (sighs) And he was like, \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea. That\u2019s so isolating. We\u2019re not talking to each other,\u201d or something. I don\u2019t know. It also led to a bit of my frustration. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201212\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20120-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20120-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">THERAPIST: Mmm. That doesn\u2019t seem so crazy. People go to movies together.  Or rent movies together (crosstalk at 00:25:02).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:25:01) yeah, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I definitely didn\u2019t get a lot of my own space this weekend. It was really about him and his friends. Making sure he was alive. Finding about their terrible troubles, so, it was really trying not to be a needy, crazy person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">THERAPIST: Mmm. But of course, you do have needs. And that doesn\u2019t make you crazy. And even though it\u2019s really nice to have friends come, it also is a disruption. And you do lose your space and your privacy and control of your schedule. That\u2019s hard, especially when even a normal\u2014in a normal week, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201271\">feeling very squeezed by other people\u2019s needs. And you don\u2019t have a ton of control over your schedule or your space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s the other thing I just sometimes get mad at is how much control I would love to have. It also stinks. Sometimes, I just get mad and refuse.  And then, take the consequences, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s hard to swing from extremes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. But if I give in completely, then, I just feel so\u2014I don\u2019t know. Abnormal, I guess. And, I mean, and the one thing I love about Josh is that, I mean, he\u2019s not anxious like this. But, I mean, he likes his schedules. He likes control. For different reasons, which I\u2019m still not entirely <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D1\">sure what they are. (chuckles) So, usually, that works really well, when it\u2019s just us together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. You\u2019ve figured out how you fit together. Even with some of his changing needs. And you throw another couple in the mix and that really upsets the balance. Because you don\u2019t have a routine with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not used to sharing space with them in this way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, I was also feeling really sad, because, I mean, they\u2019re Josh\u2019s favorite people in the world and I\u2014I mean, I also, have\u2014the reason we\u2019re not near them. So, a little bit of guilt over that, too. And, I mean, if they were next to us or living near us like they used to be, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201351\">would be so supportive and helpful. Come cook for us all the time. Walk our dogs and stuff, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">THERAPIST: It would be nice to have close friends like that here. You don\u2019t really have couples friends here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">CLIENT: No. Not like that. Especially since it\u2019s pretty when I can\u2019t get Josh (chuckles) out of the house to meet people, so . . . I don\u2019t know.  I mean, I guess it\u2019s good that this whole weekend made me just want to think this all through, as opposed to continue to be really anxious. Although, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">was definitely helped by an Ativan, (chuckles) so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.

I definitely think it would have helped a lot a long time ago if I had agreed to it. She had one time prescribed me Klonopin and I was afraid of them, so I didn\u2019t take them. (chuckles) I think they\u2019re (crosstalk at 00:28:34).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s very similar stuff. Yeah. And I will forget which one you\u2019re taking all of the time. Just correct me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20141\">CLIENT: They\u2019re that similar?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">THERAPIST: They tend to get prescribed for similar\u2014I don\u2019t know why a prescriber chooses one of over the other. They tend to get prescribed for the same types of things, in my experience. They seem to work in similar ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I had sent her a bunch of questions. And she had said there\u2019s no reason why the extra Zoloft would\u2019ve made me feel like that. But of course, I can reduce it if I wanted. (inaudible at 00:29:14) I\u2019ve been taking the extra anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Staying at the same. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s still hard to say if it\u2019s doing anything at night or not. But I\u2019m also going to see her on Friday and ask her more clearly than over e-mail (inaudible at 00:29:32) about the whole thing, so\u2014and she had also said\u2014she also said it\u2019s okay to take Ativan a few days in a row, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Okay. Because I know taking it a couple times in a row for sleep was something you had wondered about. So, not every day in a row, but a few days is okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">CLIENT: I think so. I\u2019m still a little unclear (crosstalk at 00:29:54). (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You can clarify in-person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">THERAPIST: But, for now, you\u2019ve got a good working answer for the week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">CLIENT: But I think I\u2019m out of them (inaudible at 00:30:03), so . . . (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">THERAPIST: You should check that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. If you are, call in your script ahead of time so that you can just pick it up when you\u2019re there on Friday, rather than having to do a two-part trip. Because it does sound like it\u2019s helpful to have them there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">CLIENT: Yep. Yeah. I mean, and Josh is on them, too. Sometimes it feels ridiculous we\u2019re just so drugged just to get through every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, your situation is pretty extreme. There\u2019s not a lot of\u2014yeah. I\u2019m sure when you\u2019re on that transplant list, it seems like a long list. But in reality, it\u2019s a pretty small percentage of people that ever have to deal with that type of situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I found myself looking up statistics again this morning, because they were\u2014they made us really hopeful this weekend. And there\u2019s a little bit of dreaming about what we\u2019ll do together when it\u2019s all done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: How did that feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: It was good. In fact, I had to ask Josh not to tell the two of them about our dream wedding. And, of course, he told Greg. Greg is his friend. And I had to (inaudible at 00:31:18) because we were walking the dogs. And I forget what we were talking about. Oh, she said, \u201cYou seem a little bitter.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201691\">And we had gotten\u2014I forget why she said I seemed like that. What I had been saying. So, then I told her about how we had dreamed this wedding in October. And then, realized that was probably too much of a risk. And we had come really close to paying for things and it was really close. We had taken the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201692\">dream so far. It was a pretty big disappointment when we were like, \u201cOh, wait. We shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20168-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20168-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B\">Oh. She was telling me I seemed bitter because I was trying to get Josh out of the house. To come out. And he wouldn\u2019t do it. And I was really trying. (chuckles) And I was telling her I was afraid he would just sit in the house. Because he had said, before, he would just sit and wait for a transplant, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2016B1\">however long it takes. Sit in the house. I don\u2019t want that. That doesn\u2019t seem like a healthy thing. He\u2019s been dreaming and designing the mountain bike he\u2019ll buy when he gets out and planning the trips we\u2019ll take and all this stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2016D\">But, I mean, if he has to do that for a year, that\u2014I can\u2019t imagine he could keep that up with no real life happening at all.

But to have such a contrast in what you\u2019re thinking about and what you\u2019re doing \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20171\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20173\">THERAPIST: feels too hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">CLIENT: Or it\u2019s like it\u2019s hard for me to watch. So, anyway, so, I told her about that. And then, I guess while we were gone, he was telling Greg, so (chuckles) we ended up talking about it. I forget why I started telling this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">THERAPIST: You were taking the dogs for a walk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">CLIENT: Or maybe about dreaming? I don\u2019t know. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">THERAPIST: I had asked how it felt to think about the future \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">CLIENT: (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">THERAPIST: because you told them you got really hopeful with them being here this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">CLIENT: Oh. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">THERAPIST: Telling them what your plans are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">CLIENT: Right. I can\u2019t. I still haven\u2019t decided if it\u2019s too much hope or (chuckles) just what we needed. I mean, it mostly feels good, as long as we stay realistic. But, again, yeah, this morning, I was looking at the transplant statistics, being like, \u201cHow long is it really going to be?\u201d (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201851\">And I find myself thinking, \u201cHow many months has it been? Should I start to . . .\u201d (sighs) I got a bunch of phone calls from random numbers this weekend, too, which I now have to answer no matter what. And every time, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, maybe I\u2019ll (inaudible at 00:33:52) they\u2019re here. Who\u2019s this?\u201d (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201852\">at 00:33:54) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20187\">THERAPIST: How do you know how much hope is too much hope?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20189\">CLIENT: I guess when we get disappointed so easily. And it feels so terrible. Or, at least, for me, that\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know what it was about the day we went and they were like\u2014someone said out loud, it could be a year or at least a year. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018B\">THERAPIST: And that felt crushing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah, because we\u2019d just been making all these grand plans. Because I let myself like it must happen by the summer. (sighs) So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve done that this time, though. A little nervous. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah. I mean, using your internal sense of judgment. If dreaming and fantasizing and planning and hoping feels good, then, that\u2019s good.  I think having hope is\u2014does seem important, because you are waiting for something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">CLIENT: Right. Oh, we had talked about having my own dream last time. And I went home and told Josh about it. And I think I told you I had gotten rejected from going to this Philadelphia trip. And I went home and told Josh that I had. And I asked him. Because I was afraid he would want to live near <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201911\">Portsmouth and (inaudible at 00:35:28) for the rest of our life. And that\u2019s the way he\u2019s thinking right now. (chuckles) But he was like, \u201cSure. You could get a job there. We can go move down there.\u201d Pretending it\u2019s nice, (chuckles) whatever. And it was a big relief to hear him say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20190-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20190-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20193\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m so glad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20195\">CLIENT: Which I don\u2019t know why it surprised\u2014it surprised me (inaudible at 00:35:46). (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20197\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, he can imagine a time when he\u2019ll feel less scared and less tied to this hospital, these doctors. So, then, you\u2019re free to imagine that time, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20199\">CLIENT: Well, and right now, he\u2019s dreaming about can we ever move back to Washington to be near his friends. I don\u2019t think any doctors are worth him moving back to Washington. (chuckles) Which I would do. It\u2019d be great. That\u2019s where most jobs are in what I do anyway. If they\u2019re an FDA, so it was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201991\">a\u2014yeah. Nice to dream to a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Yea. I think it\u2019s important. Dreaming and planning for your future is part of living. And it is hard when those dreams\u2014when you get some news and those dreams are crushed for a little bit. So, figuring out the balance of tempering it with reality. But you don\u2019t always know what reality is. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2019B1\">So, you can\u2019t stop yourself from thinking ahead and wondering just because there might\u2014you don\u2019t know exactly how long you\u2019re going to be on the list. The reality is it could be tomorrow or it could be a year from now.  I mean, you just don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yep. And I\u2019ve been also dreaming about things like someday (inaudible at 00:37:10) require no planning. If there\u2019s any planning, like for the wedding, attached to the dreaming, it becomes a big problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Mmm. That\u2019s when it gets trickier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, being able to think the someday. And you can think about someday\u2014you can think about your wedding. Maybe it doesn\u2019t make sense to put down deposits on things right now. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t think about what you\u2019d like and what it will feel like. Who you\u2019ll want there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A31\">I think those things can be fantasized about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why last week, that felt really hard.

What\u2019s different about this week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, just telling Josh and him being able\u2014because, I think I\u2019ve told you before, I\u2019ll often tell him terrible things I feel like I\u2019m thinking. And he hasn\u2019t (crosstalk at 00:38:00). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">THERAPIST: And wanting to work for the FDA is a terrible thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AD\">CLIENT: Well, that he won\u2019t want to ever leave the Providence area. (chuckles) So, he could stay near these doctors. (inaudible at 00:38:11) thinking. Or just anything. He hasn\u2019t really been able to my handle my deep, dark fears up until recently. Because he\u2019ll start to cry or break down or . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Sounds like he\u2019s feeling a little bit stronger, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B1\">CLIENT: (sighs) A little bit. I mean, it\u2019s hard, because it depends a lot on how much support he\u2019s been getting. We managed to get him enough pain drugs to last him until this Thursday, when he has another appointment. And we would\u2019ve had a whole different weekend. And I\u2019d be in a whole lot\u2014in a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201B11\">state if we hadn\u2019t. And that required spending hours on the phone with different doctors. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B3\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B5\">CLIENT: (sighs) So, and, I mean, I really hope he doesn\u2019t end up addicted to pain drugs. I don\u2019t know. But the fact that he was not in pain this whole weekend allowed him to sleep, himself.  And be happy because his friends were there. And not be a miserable person and then, support me, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B7\">THERAPIST: I know last time I saw you, you guys were about to embark on him trying to sleep in the bed for the first night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B9\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BB\">THERAPIST: How did that go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD\">CLIENT: I mean, it took drugs and a fan and earplugs and everything. And a long time with me fighting to stay calm to fall asleep. But I guess he didn\u2019t sleep well, because he got up in the middle of the night and was so worried that he was going to wake me. And he was so worried that I wasn\u2019t actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD1\">sleeping that the next morning\u2014I expected to wake up and him be like, \u201cOh, my gosh, that was wonderful.\u201d And then, the next night, (inaudible at 00:39:49), \u201cDon\u2019t worry. That was fine. Don\u2019t even worry.\u201d I mean, I guess\u2014I think he doesn\u2019t believe me. We tried one more night and he was just like, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BF\">THERAPIST: He couldn\u2019t relax.  He was too worried about worrying you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C1\">CLIENT: He was too worried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C3\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C5\">CLIENT: I mean, it really does. It shakes the whole bed. Really loud. I don\u2019t know if I could do it every night. I don\u2019t seem to be able to get used to things. One would think that I\u2019ll \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Mmm. His pump shakes the bed just running? Or him getting in and out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I can feel the bed vibrating a little. (chuckles) (sighs) I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an unresolved problem. And people tell me, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d I don\u2019t think I will. I think if I had the pump and it wasn\u2019t him, I\u2019d be in big trouble. Just for sleeping. I think I could get <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C91\">used to it. I don\u2019t seem to have that ability. I mean, maybe, because, I mean, when (sighs) we first \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Well, if it was constant, you\u2019d habituate to it over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD\">CLIENT: I hope so. When we first moved to our apartment, it\u2019s on a pretty busy street. And I was having so much trouble sleeping, trying to fall asleep, that if an ambulance went by\u2014and we live kind of near the hospital, in fact.  Or close enough that there\u2019s ambulances that come by (chuckles) that <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD1\">it would cause me to freak out. But now that doesn\u2019t bother me as much anymore. But I also have a fan going (sighs) to black out white noise. But that is not the same as a vibrating, beeping (chuckles) pump.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Pump right in bed with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3\">THERAPIST: But part of what helps you to block things out is hearing them all of the time. Feeling them all of the time. So, one night in, one night out. A couple nights in, a couple nights away is\u2014you lose the habituation. Right? Because it goes away. And you\u2019re like, \u201cAh, back to normal.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D5\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D7\">THERAPIST: So, I mean, if you want to learn to\u2014if you want it to be something that you don\u2019t pay attention to, then it has to be there all of the time. The same way that you don\u2019t pay attention to\u2014you don\u2019t get distracted by the sound of your heart beating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D9\">CLIENT: But I do sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Oh, but it\u2019s different.  Right? Or when it gets\u2014when it\u2019s racing, you notice it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">CLIENT: Right. Right. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561839\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E3\">THERAPIST: But when it\u2019s normal, you don\u2019t. Yeah? So, whatever is your normal \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E5\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E7\">THERAPIST: you can learn to block out. But if he can\u2019t relax because he\u2019s worried about you and doesn\u2019t trust you when you said it was okay, that\u2019s another hurdle, too. Might not be one worth fighting right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E9\">CLIENT: This morning, actually, though, he was being particularly sweet and\u2014I don\u2019t know. I guess he\u2019s particularly hopeful, after this weekend. I asked if he could try to sleep in the bed again tonight. (chuckles) So, maybe we will try to fight. I don\u2019t know. If I knew it would take a week \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Right. Then, you could get through the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201ED\">CLIENT: I could plan it. I wish I had some sense of how long it might take me to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I don\u2019t know what to predict. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F1\">CLIENT: And I can function on the drug, mask, earplug thing enough. But going on long enough, it would definitely hurt, (chuckles) so (sighs) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Does it help if you stagger? Like, if you fall asleep before he gets into bed? Or if he got into bed before you? Which might be easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F5\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I don\u2019t know, because then, I would lay there and be like, \u201cAll right. I got to fall asleep so that he can go to bed.\u201d (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F7\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Yeah. That sounds like too much pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F9\">CLIENT: It would feel like pressure. Yeah. That means he\u2019s in the room. He\u2019s making a lot of noise. He did tell me he got up in the middle of one of the nights and I definitely did not wake up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FB\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FD\">CLIENT: But I was probably in the middle of an Ambien\u2014I don\u2019t know how it works, but I know there are two . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.  If you were in a really deep sleep. Well, we\u2019ll see how tonight goes. Use all your supports. Use your fan. Use your drugs. Use your mask, your earplugs. And see if you can have some success. If you can, then, he\u2019ll feel a little bit more relaxed, which might make you feel a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201FF1\">bit less pressure to have it work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20201\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:44:36) What was good, I guess, is that I didn\u2019t end up kicking him in the middle of the night or . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20203\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. It doesn\u2019t sound like it was a disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20205\">CLIENT: (sighs) It wasn\u2019t a disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20207\">THERAPIST: Which, maybe for a first couple nights, that\u2019s a huge win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20209\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Well, why don\u2019t we wrap up there for today? I think we\u2019re on for Wednesday next time?

So, the 26th, at 3:30. I know we discussed this last time. It hasn\u2019t changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20215\">CLIENT: If you do ever get the Monday open, I certainly would love it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20217\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think I had a cancellation next week.

If I get a \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20219\">CLIENT: Well, in the future \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Did we not schedule beyond that\u2014next Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think we did. So, the Monday, the 31st, is open at 12:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20221\">CLIENT: Okay.

Yeah. So, we can do the 26th, and then the 31st, you can have the\u2014a 12:30 on the 31st.  And then, it would have to be Wednesday, the 9th. What is that, 3:30 that you do on Wednesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20227\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20229\">THERAPIST: 2:30?
