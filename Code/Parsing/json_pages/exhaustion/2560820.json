[sighs] Tuesdays. Today was booked from-started class at 8:30, then I have something going on until 8:00. But I had a 30-minute break in the middle, that was to go outside and just relax, and that was really nice, so, despite it being really busy, I'm feeling all right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I'm trying to think what the last was like. Feels like I was just here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I had a conversation with my sister that was interesting. She texted me, we were chatting, then she just said out-of-blue, \"I don't really know why you're doing what you're doing, what got you into it and what-not, so we should talk about that sometime.\" I was like, \"Oh, wow.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">We had that conversation on Sunday, I think. Yeah, and it was nice. (inaudible at 00:02:11) that conversation with my dad, not my sister, it...they're just reaching out to figure out what the heck I'm actually doing and why, [from my family] (ph), which is just feeling good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">It's also feeling weird, but...I've never really had those conversations. Now it's odd that they're happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">It also feels like we don't have...I don't know if it's the...I don't think we have the practice in having them. Just the conversations we usually have are very based in what we do rather than why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it feels weird. I don't think I talked to either of my parents since I came back, and so the talk with my mother-it was just so...perfunctory. We had to do it. We had to check in, but it didn't feel it didn't feel, I guess, anything about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">That's swirling around, but also been feeling moments in the last week of very...not very tangible, but seeing the reasons why I'm doing it...and being able to have that more-deep, \"Oh, yeah.\" Not just my-feel like I empower myself on intellect very easily, but a more visceral experience. I'd be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">\"Oh, yeah, here's the kind of an excitement that rises up,\" I'm like, \"Yes, this is what it is.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">(inaudible at 00:05:05) that, the feeling that there's still a lot of training that I need to do for myself to be able to be competent in doing that, but I guess that doesn't feel as scary, when you're those spaces of feeling it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">I think on another level I am scared that you can be competent but also not have that-or not be able to tap into that zeal, and then that doesn't seem to compute, that doesn't seem to be a winning or not a workable combination. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I had felt (inaudible at 00:06:20). I began having moments where I'm interacting with my writing and just being really frustrated by it. Got an assignment back from her, one of my professors, that is basically like, \"So I don't know if you're using this for practice professional writing, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">if you are, there are some issues. If you're just doing this, we're okay with it. If you're just handing in the assignment, that's fine.\" It was basically them telling me it's there. It's one of those... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">You know, first I'm frustrated, because it's-I read the thing, it made complete sense to me. I didn't see any missing words or grammar problems, so it's frustrating to think, \"I tried.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Then there's a deeper, \"What does this mean I can actually do?\" because it feels like it's a limiting thing: now I need to figure out how I can live my life so I will never have to do writing. That's a sinking...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560820\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Why do you have to live your life so you never have to do writing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Well, it's a feeling I've had for a really long time. I know it's not my strength, and so it would be much easier to not have to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">I know that that's not reasonable and it's just about getting strategies and doing the types of writing that actually comes naturally to me, versus the stuff I'm forced to do, which doesn't...I feign (ph) to work through that process, of frustration and then feeling of narrowing it down to being compressed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">and then, \"No, it's just one assignment. It's just one thing.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Do you think it's easier to communicate speaking than it is writing (crosstalk at 00:08:42)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Oh, totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: What do you think putting it-because some people have the opposite problem, because they don't have the ability to work it over, right, that you have in writing. Speaking is more impromptu. What do you think it is about putting things on paper? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I think there are a few elements to it. I know parts of it have to just do with how my brain is wired, in terms of my processing speeds. Because my verbal processing speed is so fast, to be able to put it down on paper inherently means that it's slowed down, and so I can't get the same thought. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">I can't get it onto the paper fast enough to capture it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">My thoughts in my head have a lot of nuance. I try to add that nuance when I'm writing, and then it just confuses it, because it's too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">When I read, I read more blocks of words and sentences, rather than words, and so the order of things is just not-I don't absorb that a sentence needs this, this, and this, because I don't really read sentences, per se I read blocks of text.  I figure out the meaning by putting all these blocks of texts together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">When I'm writing, I can't-I have to figure out-I have to make sure the sentence makes sense, and so sentences that don't make sense will make sense to me, because I'm either reading words in or I'm...it just does. It captures exactly what I'm trying to say, but it's missing a subject and, \"Oh.\" It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">like teasing that out and being able to bring the specificity of the thought into writing doesn't work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">There are some things that are easier.  I can write speeches really well, because it's meant to be spoken, it's oral. I can bring syntax and style into a written piece that aren't grammatically correct, but because it doesn't need to be grammatically correct, it flows, it works, it's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">I've had some success writing more spoken-word poetry. Recently, I've been writing a few narrative pieces, so I don't know. It's the specificity of the academic writing that I struggle with, or just general grammar issues.  It's always been like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I know you mentioned that when you said that, I remember you saying that in a previous session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I guess it came back to the moments of, \"Oh, yeah, this is it.\" I guess one of the things that's been on my mind is it feels like there's a threshold that escapes me, in getting to fully live in that space and that I'm kind of looking at it. Maybe touching it, but not fully being there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560820\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">It doesn't feel like a question of...skill or...having the tools or having the ability or what-not.

It's hard to know what is normal, what is the...what is my carrying capacity for being able to do things well? [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">Someone asked me what my hobbies were, and I realized that was a really hard question to answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:20:47)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Because I don't think I have hobbies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:20:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I think it kind of just struck me. I was like, \"I don't really have hobbies.\"  I have...you know, I go to school. That embodies a lot of what I do. I usually [a whole] (ph) bunch of volunteer things I do, and I guess those are hobbies, per se, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">I think I'll be like, \"Oh, I like cooking and biking and reading and...\" I cook because I need to eat, because that [laughs] and I, you know, will sometimes put more effort into it than other times, but that doesn't exactly seem like a hobby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">I don't go on bike rides just for fun; I bike around because that's how I get from Place A to B. It's something I do enjoy doing but mostly in the context of I get enjoyment A., because it gets me from Point A to Point B in an efficient way, and there is some enjoyment in the physicality of it and the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">feel of it, but I don't... (inaudible at 00:22:11), \"Oh, I'm just going to go for a bike ride today.\" That doesn't do it for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">Reading? I'm not a fan of literature, so most of the time I'm reading non-fiction things that are usually related to either school or something that I'm involved in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: I think my hobbies are reduced to watching television.

Just how...it almost feels like an unraveling to a point of just...not being able to put all the parts back into the box.  Almost like-it doesn't...doesn't feel like it's me. It feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB1\">like...it does and it doesn't.

It sounds like an experience you might want to stay away from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you're describing kind of two modes, either being very distant or being almost too close.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">THERAPIST: It's the point that it almost sort of feels like it's fragmented, like you feel fragmented, like there are pieces of yourself don't hang together, somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010F\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20111\">THERAPIST: It feels very disruptive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">THERAPIST: I guess maybe then one of the goals is to create a space in between those spaces, in between those places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
