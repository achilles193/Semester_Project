I just had a bunch of champagne. I cried all morning after I got the ring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: What kind of tears?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: [sighs] I was super excited. I mean, I kind of knew it was happening. I knew it was happening but still felt so overwhelming. I thought I\u2019m okay. Then, I called my mom to ask her if she\u2019d come to the hospital later. She\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t. I have to teach. Why do you need me to come?\u201d Then, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">just started crying.  For like an hour on the phone to her. She was really happy. Everything\u2019s going really well with Josh. He\u2019s moving along really fast. The heart\u2019s working very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s very overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: You have so many things to feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. The couple days I\u2019ve been searching were super overwhelming and I thought everything was okay. And then, I just cried for an hour driving home to my house. I\u2019m not even sure why. I think I was relieved. I think it was relief tears, but\u2014happy tears? And then, I thought I was okay until <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">this morning. Because we had this whole issue, FedEx not being able to actually get us the rings and having to wait for it, the person to come to the door. I didn\u2019t get it. It was going to go back to the jeweler. And then, I just felt like now (inaudible at 00:01:59) going to happen at all.  And then, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">maybe Josh would start doing poorly. I don\u2019t know. It just felt like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a lot of pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I was like, \u201cWhy am I feeling so overwhelmed by getting this rings?\u201d I guess it feels like a good thing. Maybe good things are now happening. And if I didn\u2019t get it, I don\u2019t know. I mean, as of yesterday, (crosstalk at 00:02:23).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: It symbolized a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Nothing disastrous should happen after the first few days. We would know if he got some weird illness from the person or something was bleeding or just some\u2014something unknown was happening. So, now, it would just\u2014it should be okay unless he gets sick. And we\u2019re like, \u201cReally? (inaudible at 00:02:44) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">We took our first walk down the hall last night. He was really scared. He didn\u2019t go out of his (inaudible at 00:02:50). It was super exciting. Throw a party at the hospital. Everyone\u2019s super excited. There were four hearts transplanted in the last two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Wow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s crazy there. And Josh is doing really, really well. And no one got a heart until like two weeks ago. Since like (inaudible at 00:03:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s weird. Although maybe normal in the heart transplant world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Who knows? There\u2019s no \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Mmm, right. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to it, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: And two days after I last saw you, he got a call for a high-risk heart in the middle of the night. Meaning that the girl overdosed, which they have to tell you, because there\u2019s a potential she could have been\u2014gotten some needle infection or AIDS or hepatitis or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Can\u2019t they test for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561847\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: It takes a couple months to be for sure, I think.

And you can\u2019t really wait a couple months for a heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. You got like four hours. So, we had to decide (inaudible at 00:03:51). Then, we turned it down, because Josh has been doing well enough that he didn\u2019t want to risk getting hepatitis or something if he could help it, even though it was a low chance.  In the past two weeks, we\u2019ve been\u2014I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">been really trying to believe. I\u2019m not really good at wholeheartedly believing things.

You may think it was the right decision. And he\u2019s been having nightmares every night about the surgery. And how he was convinced he was going to die. And was crying on Saturday night. Thinking about how it could be our last night together. (inaudible at 00:04:31) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">the heart and all this. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019ve certainly lived through a lot in the past week. You\u2019ve lived through a lot in the past year, too. But what a lot of things to have happen in a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I have all these emotions. I want to happen, but I\u2019m afraid to happen. Can we actually hope that\u2014can we actually plan our wedding? [0:05:01] Can we actually hope that he\u2019ll be out and doing well in a week, which is what they say? He should be able to shower tomorrow (inaudible at 00:05:11) since <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">November. Are we actually moving in a good \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: It would be (inaudible at 00:05:17).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I mean, last time he was in the hospital, everything was just problems, problems, problems, disaster, disaster. And I know he\u2019s scared to talk about it a little bit (crosstalk at 00:05:25). To jinx anything. It\u2019s just too good. It\u2019s too good. He\u2019s just moving faster than they would\u2019ve expected. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">It\u2019s all going too well, so we\u2019re [sighs]\u2014but then, all these things that we\u2019ve been dreaming are \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Actually happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: can we actually have these dreams now?

I mean, he was (inaudible at 00:05:55) like water dripping or something yesterday.

And then, waited all day for him to get out of surgery. And then, I was\u2014and then, I had\u2014just been exhausted, meltdown.

With my family and\u2014I definitely don\u2019t usually melt down with my parents. My grandma was there, which was nice. And I thought I was fine. They (inaudible at 00:07:58) some dinner after we saw him at the hospital briefly.  (inaudible at 00:08:03) And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">then, I drove home. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not okay. I can\u2019t go home alone.\u201d My dogs were at my parents\u2019 house. I was going to be alone. I can\u2019t do that. And all my friends were out. It was a Friday night, 9:00. So, I finally ended up getting ahold of my brother and I just melted down to him, while I\u2019m driving, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">on the phone.

I mean, my parents are trying to get me to stay at their house (inaudible at 00:08:50). And the weekend, I\u2019ve spent with Josh.  I was just nervous.

I couldn\u2019t believe that he was (inaudible at 00:09:11) doing well. They always say he might be asleep for days. They don\u2019t know.

So, that was a whirlwind of a weekend <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">with all this stuff. And then, today, I just\u2014I\u2019m so overwhelmed this morning. I went outside.

And I guess because he was being so emotional and upset; I just kept telling him how sure I was that we made the right decision. And pretty much believed it. It felt like the right decision and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201532\">I had to believe that, otherwise I\u2019d be (inaudible at 00:23:00) wrong for it, too.  I was getting a little worried that this couldn\u2019t continue. He was just having a really hard time with (inaudible at 00:23:09).

No way. (inaudible at 00:23:44) and we had to be sure that it was right or\u2014I mean, there\u2019s no other thing to do (crosstalk at 00:23:50).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: Right. There\u2019s no going back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: Right. And I wasn\u2019t going to\u2014I\u2019m not the one getting my chest chopped open, so\u2014but for him, it made it so real, the surgery (crosstalk at 00:24:00). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Right. And that people really do call and say, \u201cThere\u2019s a heart available.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: Exactly. And (inaudible at 00:24:04) to think (inaudible at 00:24:04). And it was really soon. We did not expect it\u2014this is way sooner than we had ever\u2014anyone would\u2019ve ever expected. Or told us or told us to prepare for, so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yeah. People were talking years. Right? I mean, you told me (crosstalk at 00:24:16) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">CLIENT: Up to a year, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were like, \u201cOh, well, we\u2019re not even worried about this until the summer.\u201d So, yeah, so, suddenly, it was panic (inaudible at 00:24:22) but thinking about the actual surgery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">Yeah, so then, that night, I come home. He calls me. I come home. He\u2019s crying. He\u2019s crying, everybody knows. Tell them he loves them. Freaking out. I have to drag him out the house. He\u2019s bringing out the phone. The doctor\u2019s like, \u201cGet your butt down here now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">THERAPIST: [chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">CLIENT: And just hang ups. And just come. And he was an emotional wreck. He was terrified. So, again, I couldn\u2019t freak out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">THERAPIST: You couldn\u2019t be terrified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">CLIENT: And I saw his mom\u2014I mean, I could still (inaudible at 00:24:55)\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to freak out in front of her.

Or didn\u2019t want to, because it would be too hard to. Yeah, then, that whole next day, I waited with his mom for the surgeon to come and tell us things were okay. And we were.

[chuckles] Just sounds still so weird. [I don\u2019t know] (ph). And tell people. Tell my <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D1\">parents.

I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: I wonder what it is about going public with your engagement that makes it so much more real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

I don\u2019t know. [chuckles] I don\u2019t know.

You\u2019ve had lot of things to deal with and crises to get through. To have some things to celebrate is a switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yep. Right after we got the call from\u2014for the heart, too, we went to a conference, which I was engulfed in. Really worried about, stressed out about. It was a very exhausting week.

You went to the conference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: So, two days later, yeah. I went to this conference.  And suddenly, it just wrapped up in school for a week but in a very stressful way. An exhausting way. And then, I came back and a few days later, we have another call. [chuckles] And now I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing in school (crosstalk at 00:29:14).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, school took a back seat. [chuckles] This week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I e-mailed my advisor finally on Monday. I\u2019d be like, \u201cJosh got a heart.\u201d So, we just had a nice conversation about in Montana, despite all the stress (inaudible at 00:29:29). He said, \u201cI hope things work out for you,\u201d and all this stuff (ph). [chuckles] Of course, he was really ill on <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD1\">Monday and hadn\u2019t responded to my e-mail. And he just sent out a blanket e-mail to the group that he was really sick and could I take care of this one thing for him.

Your history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I was very lucky, in a way, because they waited two years, so I\u2019m sure half the people were not eligible anymore for that or got something else. [chuckles] But also, I had so much guilt over being (inaudible at 00:31:20) my advisor because of all these problems (crosstalk at 00:31:24).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s (crosstalk at 00:31:24).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:31:24) so nice to let me stay and (inaudible at 00:31:26) me anyway.

He keeps going on about how his blood clotting levels [chuckles] were almost dangerously low on Thursday when he got the call for the heart. Who knows why?

They kept questioning him about it when we were at the hospital, like, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d (crosstalk at 00:32:51) Because basically if you eat too much green stuff, there\u2019s a vitamin.

But when they do the surgery, they fill you full of fluid to keep your blood pressure <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201F51\">up.
