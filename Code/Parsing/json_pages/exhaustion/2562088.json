So I haven\u2019t been sleeping terribly well and I had a dream the other night that Sharon (ph) was, I was trying to get Sharon (ph) to nap on my chest and I wanted to fall asleep also but I dreamed that I couldn\u2019t sleep because Sharon (ph) kept waking up and wouldn\u2019t sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: You mean in a real way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I was dreaming but I thought I was awake. I was saying God if I don\u2019t get sleep tonight going to work\u2019s going to suck tomorrow. But in my dream I wasn\u2019t asleep because Sharon (ph) wouldn\u2019t go to sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Okay. So, the other night you were asleep and you\u2019re worried while you\u2019re asleep about not getting to sleep or not sleeping well. And the dream that you have about it is that you\u2019re with Sharon (ph) and trying to get her to sleep on you and she keeps waking up which keeps you from falling asleep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: But the dream was after I\u2019d already woken up so I had actually woken up several times that night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Right, so that your dream fit, I guess what is striking is in a way the dream fit very closely to the circumstance you were in of being worried about getting sleep or being able to sleep well, but in another way it was different because you were at work in the dream and in real life but [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">at 00:02:07].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes, so that was the dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Do you have any associations to the dream? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I guess if I have to think this hard about it probably not. The other thing it makes me think about is that I had this dream where I feel like I I woke up the next day and said wow I really did not sleep at all last night. Then I realized at least part of the time that I thought I didn\u2019t sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">at all I was actually asleep. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">Part of the reason that Sharon (ph) has so much trouble sleeping is that Monica doesn\u2019t really, doesn\u2019t do sleep training. She just sleeps with her and that sort of makes my life harder but I also totally see why she does it because it\u2019s really nice to sleep with a baby. It\u2019s a really nice thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">So, yes, I guess I just sort of had a lot of this both like this is really nice and also this is really frustrating because I need you to take a nap, I need you to, you need to do this thing and I need to help you but I can\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yes, I mean I have some associations but I don\u2019t really know what to make of them yet. I mean, [inaudible at 00:04:45] even when you actually are sleeping it\u2019s not really not restful, like there\u2019s some part of you that can\u2019t sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yes, I feel like I\u2019ve been less anxious during the day and more anxious, having more anxious dreams. I sort of keep a diary card so my mood and my anxiety and all that. And I\u2019d say oh, I guess I wasn\u2019t really anxious today at all but I worry a lot when I\u2019m asleep. It\u2019s just not good. I do feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">like I\u2019m more tired the next day when I am worried. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: The only sense I have, and this is [inaudible at 00:05:42] but these days any ways on Fridays the woman who comes before you is a woman who has a little baby and who comes after you is pregnant.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562088\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Oh I didn\u2019t know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. You didn\u2019t know that. At first I thought that was relevant but [inaudible at 00:05:57].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes, I didn\u2019t know. The woman that comes before me is pretty great in just sort of the culture of you don\u2019t really talk to each other when you pass in the therapist\u2019s office and she just talks to me. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s okay? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes. No it\u2019s really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: No, she\u2019s very nice. I just wanted to make sure it was all right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes, no it\u2019s good because there\u2019s certainly a kinship that I feel with the people that I see but I also feel like giving people space is one of the ways that you take care of them. I\u2019ve been sort of, I don\u2019t know, asking a lot of that from James. I\u2019ve just been really sad and I just don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">to talk to anybody. And so, yes, he\u2019s been giving me a lot of space and I think that\u2019s been okay. [Pause] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">Yes, things are tough. [Pause] I\u2019m going to a conference tomorrow. It\u2019s not very well timed in terms of my mood and I\u2019m just not very excited about it. [Pause] There\u2019s five people going from my church, or five people who are turning (ph) going to my church and priests. And I only know one of the people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">she goes to the 6:00 service with me, and I really don\u2019t like her so we\u2019ll see how that goes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">The church attracts a lot of weird people, which I think is a really good thing. It\u2019s really good and I\u2019m sort of really getting to be at peace with sometimes people are weird in social ways that make me not like them and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s been a sort of a recent thing to realize that if I don\u2019t like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">somebody maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re doing something. [Laughing] Maybe it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m a terrible person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yes, I guess. I don\u2019t know. This woman is, she\u2019s very earnest, very lovely and has a tendency to be sort of I think she has an MDiv from Brown so she really, really wants to talk to me about her degree and about the professors and pal around about Hebrew and stuff. And so I have to both deal <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">with I\u2019m really grieving that, I don\u2019t really want to talk about it. And also the impulse to stomp on her a little bit, to be like I\u2019m really glad you made it through intermediate Hebrew but I\u2019m sort of 10 years in, so, I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t patronize me, which in itself I feel like turns into me trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">to out-patronize her. And that doesn\u2019t bring out the best in me and I just want to walk away from that, I don\u2019t like being that person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yes, and maybe there\u2019s a way in which it feels like she\u2019s being incredibly insensitive and you really want to slam her, even if she couldn\u2019t know how insensitive she\u2019s being. You still feel that way and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes, I think the last time she sort of went off on it I sort of said yes, I\u2019m not in that field anymore and just left it at that. [Pause] I don\u2019t want it to really I just want to talk about how sad I am but I don\u2019t know what to say about it. Just been really sad. [Pause] Every day it\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">a mountain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Maybe there are ways that you\u2019re talking about it. I mean in the dream, you appear to be anxious at night and there\u2019s a, in a way, a part of you that worries about not getting enough sleep. The other part\u2019s just crying, crying, crying. And sort of the [inaudible at 00:14:56] you\u2019re upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">I think because she kind of broke something that you\u2019re really set, one of the things you\u2019re really set about. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562088\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause] I worry about James in this. It feels like, it feels like it\u2019d be very easy for me to hurt him a lot in this volley (ph). I don\u2019t know. I just want to die. I feel like I don\u2019t have a lot of margin for error, if that makes sense, by claiming (ph) to not to know how much I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">give up. And I\u2019m not sure I can do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You mean not let him know or not give up or both?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Both. [Pause] I feel like there\u2019s this trap where the way that I could not let him know how bad things are for me is to just shut him out but that\u2019s also the problem. And, yes, [pause] I don\u2019t know. [Pause] Talking is really exhausting today. I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: I know the tongue [inaudible at 00:19:40] it would be sort of reason to worry or be concerned about what to let him know about and what not to let him know about. I know that\u2019s there but I think being so sad also just always feels like it\u2019s going to cause a drastic problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. The outfit might be different but the worries, kind of the same worries. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I know you, I think, trust me quite a lot around that but also that it still hurts hearing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: You mean telling you about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Just talk about it, yes and being set back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes. In some ways, I don\u2019t know, I feel I\u2019m at the point where it\u2019s less scary to talk about it than it is not to talk about it because if I don\u2019t talk about it here it makes it tough to be alone with it, yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s pretty overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes, and that would be the end, not being able to deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yes, sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I\u2019m eating a lot of chocolate this week, which is really I don\u2019t really like chocolate that much. It\u2019s not a comfort food for me in general. But I went to the store with the kids because they were out of milk and I wasn\u2019t, that\u2019s not really my job and I wasn\u2019t going to bother. But then I realized <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200751\">that that would mean that I couldn\u2019t have any tea for the rest of the day so I said [laughing] okay, we\u2019re going. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re going to have to go to the store for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: And then, Cadbury Cr\u00e8me Eggs are about my favorite things in the world so I got some for the kids and me. [Laughing]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: That seems like you\u2019re hanging in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Feel like I faring better. I\u2019m tired because I\u2019m trying not to buy most chocolate because of ethical issues because most chocolate is produced by slaves, and mostly children. And I\u2019m sort of said yes, this is going to get me through the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">Yes, I feel like I\u2019m getting better at sort of taking care of myself and things like that. I\u2019m not sure how much it helps; it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: I can sort of imagine that it takes some of the edge off the present [inaudible at 00:26:27] aspect rather like feeling much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yes. Taking the edge off is better. I don\u2019t feel quite so desperate with it. It doesn\u2019t help that the payroll department screwed up. This is the second or third time they done it and so James didn\u2019t get paid today. So we had to sort of shuffle some things and we ended up having to borrow some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">money from my parents so we could pay the rent. Yes, we\u2019re living pretty close to the bone financially and that\u2019s just exhausting in its own way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562088\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">I, the church I go to, it\u2019s so funny. I sat in [inaudible at 00:27:55] woman that I she\u2019s in the pew next to me last week. And it was a service for the directors or just installment so it\u2019s a lot of people who don\u2019t ordinarily go to the same service as the special service. And so she\u2019s talking to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">me and she asked where do you live? And I said the Square, north of the Commons. And she said oh yes, I live in the building right next to you. And she said it\u2019s kind of yes, I guess you sort of have to know somebody to get into the building. Apparently it\u2019s this quaint, upscale place [laughing] so <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">I\u2019m thinking I am not at all who you think I am. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">She was sort of describing her beautiful two-bedroom apartment with a view out and she said yes, the ceilings are just wonderful. They\u2019re 10or 12-foot ceilings in this lovely old apartment but it\u2019s basically the size of a shoebox. And, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just weird feeling like I live sort of between <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">social classes in some ways. In that sense I get to think about class a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">She was just shocked and appalled that they were going to keep raising their rents and said she may have to move out. I just don\u2019t have any energy to be that upset about that any more. The rents are really high; that\u2019s just how that\u2019s Andover. I\u2019ve lived here for almost a year and a half, which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">about as long as I\u2019ve lived anywhere for 10 years. Oh wow, you move every year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Sure. [inaudible at 00:30:50] that crossed me is how oppressive so much of this feels financially with the rents and living so close to the bone financially. And I don\u2019t know there\u2019s something about the way it seems to be a lot of feeling when you mentioned that child slaves harvesting, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: I guess I had this thing go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just I don\u2019t know I really just want to be able to eat things that I like without worrying about what it\u2019s doing around the world. But I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t not know that this is going on. And so my choices are buy it or don\u2019t buy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Even so there\u2019s either something about the horribleness of what\u2019s going on that hits pretty hard. It is horrible I\u2019m not saying otherwise, but there\u2019s something that also seems pretty resolute about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: I think that it\u2019s something about this sort of horribleness that\u2019s behind very mundane things. You think chocolate it\u2019s this nice treat. Well, yes, and it costs a couple of dollars to you and it\u2019s picked by small children who have disfiguring scars from the machetes that they use to cut it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200991\">I always sort of want those reports to be an exaggeration but they really don\u2019t seem to be. It really seems like all efforts to reform that industry have been strenuously resisted. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">This is why I don\u2019t follow the news. Lately it\u2019s just overwhelming. [Pause] I think I remember reading in high school that I think it was John Keats refused to eat sugar because it was produced by slaves and sort of thinking what a quixotic decision that was. It did nothing at all to the slave trade <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">[laughing] and also thinking what else are you going to do? It might have been William Blake. It was one of the romantic poets. And it wasn\u2019t one of the ones that, it wasn\u2019t Byron who just went off and got himself killed fighting for independence somewhere that he didn\u2019t really know much about or understand. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D2\">He just sort of lived at home and didn\u2019t eat sugar. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562088\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">[Pause crying]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">When it gets really bad like this I always sort of hope that, I guess I always sort of hope that the pain would not, won\u2019t be enough to just sort of take me away, carry me away. I [won\u2019t be] (ph) here at the end of it and it\u2019s just harassment (ph). It just keeps coming. I feel like, it seems like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">supposed to feel good about being resilient but I really don\u2019t. It sucks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yes, you just want it to stop. .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: That really [inaudible] makes me think about somebody holding you up so you can get hit again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes. [Pause] Where is it? So I\u2019m cold as well as crying. [Pause] Yes, I\u2019m a little bit anxious about not saying much but I just don\u2019t have the energy to care very much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Well also, I mean I\u2019d imagine you\u2019re feeling like no energy (ph) is nice in a way. Really what\u2019s that got to do about how you\u2019re feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:45:15].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. Yes, it sort of feels like my intellectual sense of what we\u2019re doing here, enterprises, is pretty divorced right now of my emotional sense of what this accomplishes. I don\u2019t know. Not talking is worse. Not being here is worse.  [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: We should stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Just make me feel better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Thank you.
