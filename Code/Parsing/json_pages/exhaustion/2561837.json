(chuckles) Lots of good things and bad things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Which (inaudible at 00:00:15) do you want to go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Well, okay. Every time something (ph) bad happened, I immediately start thinking about what I\u2019m going to tell you. Which sometimes feels to be counter-effective. It also makes me feel a little crazy. (chuckles) And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever told you this before, but, I don\u2019t know. Lately it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">been really a problem, because then, I think about\u2014it also makes it worse in a way. (chuckles) (inaudible at 00:00:39)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yeah. What is the process? What\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Well, so, on Sunday, our\u2014I decided I wanted the dogs to come home. And so, they came home on Sunday. And [then they] (ph) came home, and the couple who brought them\u2014who was taking care of them brought them. They were really nice. And the dogs were also clearly a little different (chuckles) than <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">when they last left.  And I don\u2019t know, I just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: How are they different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Well, they\u2019ve been spoiled rotten, basically. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. It was so overwhelming, the whole thing, that I just cried for like 20 minutes after the people left. And I wasn\u2019t even sure if I was happy or sad or why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: You were emotional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (sighs) I still don\u2019t even know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">And then, Josh did something similar. (chuckles) At the end of the week, he went and laid out\u2014he\u2019s still been sleeping on the couch, because he didn\u2019t want to\u2014doesn\u2019t want to ruin the relationship. And he went and laid down on the bed to take a nap. And it was probably the first time he\u2019s laid on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">bed since he\u2019s got home. And I guess it was so comfortable, he started to cry. And he couldn\u2019t decide if he was happy or sad or whatever. It was just too\u2014it was so comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And that was good. But it was also really sad that he hadn\u2019t been so comfortable \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Right. That he didn\u2019t deny himself the comfort. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So, I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with us. (chuckles) We had a great day when the dogs came home. But then, I was also so upset or\u2014I don\u2019t even know if I was upset or couldn\u2019t figure out what I was feeling. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Right. I think you\u2019re a little\u2014I think you\u2019re both overwhelmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: And so, when these\u2014a bunch of these sorts of things happen, and then I just try to figure out why. And then about what I\u2019ll say here. Which is not (crosstalk at 00:02:27) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Think about what you\u2019ll see here because you feel like you need to figure it out in order to present it to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe. I mean, just to figure out what is going on. And maybe it feels more urgent. I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. I don\u2019t know. I thought I was okay this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">Okay. Last week, I was way too happy. I was so happy. And it was kind of how I felt when I first started taking Zoloft. Things were not good, but it didn\u2019t matter. And I just felt so good. (chuckles) And I freaked out a few days after I last saw you, because I woke up in the middle of the night a few <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">nights later going a mile a minute. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">And then, I think the next night, I took an Ativan before I went to sleep, which are awesome. Except that I\u2019m not sure I had a clear conversation with Linda about how exactly I\u2019m supposed to use it. If I\u2019m supposed to take it every day, because that would be great. I wish I could take like ten a day. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">That would be great. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">So, anyway, I freaked about taking \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re not supposed to take ten a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I\u2019m pretty (chuckles) sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) But I do think you should talk to\u2014because she gave it to you to use, from what I recall, for nights when you\u2019re having a really hard time sleeping. And for times when you anticipate that there\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s really difficult, like a surgery day or \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right. But I know Ambien, I shouldn\u2019t take every day, because it will become addictive. Even if I couldn\u2019t sleep for a month. So, I\u2019m not sure how often I can take and still not \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so I think you need to talk with her about what the limits are.  It\u2019s not a thing to use, I think, in a daily way like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. And the bottle says, \u201cTake up to one daily.\u201d And I couldn\u2019t remember what she\u2019d said, so I don\u2019t know. And of course, I worry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: You can e-mail her. You don\u2019t have to wait until your next appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t e-mailed her. I should just do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And then, you have it in writing, too, to refer back to if you get confused. So, that might be a good thing to shoot her a quick e-mail about, \u201cGive me some clear-cut directions on how to best use this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And she\u2019ll respond.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: What was I just going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">Oh. Because I was having weird problems\u2014I wasn\u2019t necessarily (ph) having problems sleeping. I just wasn\u2019t sleeping well. Waking up in the middle of the night, or not being able to fall asleep for just longer than usual. And I freaked. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you got nervous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: So, I started taking less Zoloft again.  And I don\u2019t know if that really was a good choice. So, I just have to calm down and take more [of them] (ph) as of today. But, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve been really agitated since I stopped being so happy. (chuckles) And just confused, I guess. Randomly crying. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">And then, we had a great day on Saturday. And we went to my parents\u2019 house. And Josh was really making an effort. We went to a restaurant for the first time in months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s really exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Had a pain-free, medical-problem-free lunch\/dinner thing. Felt so happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: That sounds great. Yeah. Yeah, so your mood\u2014I mean, your\u2014(inaudible at 00:05:48) you have strong reactions to things that happen, whether they be good or bad. Right? You have this good day and you feel elated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I can\u2019t stop thinking about why. When it\u2019s bad.  I don\u2019t think I go on and on when it\u2019s a good day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But why do you react so intensely when it\u2019s a bad day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well, and I can\u2019t seem to stay happy if Josh is miserable. I mean, maybe for a day. But if there\u2019s another day and another day? (sighs) He banged his leg on something. And because he\u2019s on blood thinners, it makes this huge hematoma, I guess. And then, it makes all his muscles freak out and it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">just really painful (ph). So, that has been the pain of the week. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Well, how could you stay completely divorced from that? I mean, I think it\u2019s unrealistic to expect that it\u2019s going to have no impact on your mood, because you live with him. So, it\u2019s hard to say, \u201cThat\u2019s your stuff and this is my stuff,\u201d because you see it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: I mean, and he\u2019s just walking around miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: [I mean] (ph), you care about him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Freaking out. This morning, he particularly just\u2014\u201dWhat\u2019s the point of being home?\u201d and \u201cThis is all terrible. My life is terrible.\u201d  I mean, people keep asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t it great that he\u2019s home?\u201d And it sort of is. And then, I mean, he wrote this long thing on the website. I think I told you about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">it. About how being home is incomplete and it will never be complete. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">There\u2019s not a whole lot more progress. Or the progress that we made from now on is really slow. And so, it\u2019s less of a, \u201cOh, our first this. Our first that.\u201d (chuckles) To keep us excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Right. The milestones are harder to come by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right. The fact that the blood thinners make his body so (chuckles) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Right. So fragile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: fragile is really, I think, killing him, which then kills me. (sighs) So, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: It feels like your mood is really precarious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s up and down and up and down. I guess that\u2019s precarious. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s good but on the\u2014or I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I guess by precarious, (inaudible at 00:08:09) any little thing can really tip you one way or the other significantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I was feeling a little I don\u2019t want say rebellious but frustrated end of last week. So, I took my little brother out and got really drunk with my little brother. And then, the next day (crosstalk at 00:08:28) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:08:28) frustrated and rebellious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: But I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m rebelling against. The fact that I should\u2019ve been at home with Josh. I don\u2019t know. (chuckles) Then, I went home and I changed his dressing after having like five drinks, which is just really irresponsible. And then, I went shopping the next day with my mom and bought <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">all this silly stuff that I didn\u2019t need, just because I was feeling like I just wanted to make slightly bad choices. I don\u2019t know. Not that bad, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: How did the buying stuff make you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I think I bought a ridiculous pair of earrings that I then wore to the hospital on Tuesday just because.  I always make an effort to look nicer when I go to the hospital. Just so it doesn\u2019t suck me into its sadness. And then, the nurses comment on my earrings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">So, I don\u2019t know. Made me worried about money afterwards, but also (chuckles)\u2014I don\u2019t know. It was satisfying, I guess (crosstalk at 00:09:27) a way. But then, I wonder if that\u2019s bad. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Why would it be bad? What are you really worried about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Oh, I mean, money is sort of a\u2014it\u2019s not a problem, it\u2019s just tight with Josh. I also feel really guilty because I agreed to have the dogs come home, because he would pay to someone to daycare three days a week, which is really expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">And so, I\u2019m taking the dogs out. I go drinking. Whatever. And he\u2019s sending them to daycare so I can (crosstalk at 00:09:56). I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: So, I guess you have to figure out is the money really an issue.  Or is that you\u2019re being a little bit more flexible with your money than what you typically would. Because, I mean, if that\u2019s really a problem, then we have to look at, well, are these\u2014how impulsive are your\u2014how risky are your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">decisions? How impulsive are they? Is that problematic? Or is this appropriately way to give you at a time when there\u2019s so little that you have control over? And things are pretty sucky. And maybe a little brightness like a new pair of earrings is worth it.

If I horrified her, she would certainly have said so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, she didn\u2019t think it was too crazy, then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: No. She was a little bit like, \u201cWhoa,\u201d but \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: \u201cWhoa\u201d because of the expense or, \u201cWhoa,\u201d because of different taste?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Well, because of the way I spend (inaudible at 00:10:52). I was like, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll buy this, that.\u201d I mean, she thought the earrings were crazy and\u2014I don\u2019t know.  She\u2019s just not super-talkative about her judgments of me, but . . . (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: But she was making slight judgments, it sounds like. But not totally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Or not a strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. She didn\u2019t intervene afterwards or anything. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">I don\u2019t know. I mean, I guess I feel okay about it. I just, while I was doing it, recognized that I was coming from feelings of frustration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it makes sense to me that you\u2019re frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:11:43) frustrated doesn\u2019t even feel right, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Do you want a word list? Find something that resonates better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I bought this emotions\u2014you know, the emoticons list for Josh when he was in the hospital, because people were always coming in and completely clashing on how he was doing at the moment.  He was really on-edge and they would just bombard him. Or they would be really pushy. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">So, I got him this emotions list thing. (chuckles) And every once in a while, I\u2019ll flip through it. And, I mean, there\u2019s like 100 things. And none of them are ever quite right. I don\u2019t know. Maybe there\u2019s the right word, but (inaudible at 00:12:22).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: [Well, let\u2019s give it a try] (ph). Because sometimes, if hit upon the right thing, it just feels better to know what you\u2019re actually feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: I mean, crazed, a little bit. But it\u2019s not quite an emotion, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:38) some of these lists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:42) favorite one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: So, they\u2019re in categories. So, flip to a negative one.  You\u2019re also allowed to feel one\u2014more than one thing at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, hostile almost feels right. If there was on occasion, I would\u2019ve gotten into a fight with somebody like I\u2019ve done before. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Oh. Like over the parking spot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Worked-up? That\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: I guess worked-up.

Who or what do you really want to get in a fight with? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I guess not being able to fight with Josh right now kind of stinks. On Tuesday, I had to drag him out to go (inaudible at 00:14:15) check-up. And he ended (inaudible at 00:14:18) exhausted. And I had to drag him out of the house. And I was feeling sort of really frustrated <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">just all day. Also, I had a lot of work to do. (inaudible at 00:14:27) trying to do work while we were at the hospital and\u2014I don\u2019t know. And he moves (ph) so slowly. And particularly. It\u2019s very hard to slow down. And I also can\u2019t get frustrated at him, because it\u2019s not his fault. It just doesn\u2019t go <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C52\">anywhere, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So, it\u2019s like you want to be able to yell at him to hurry up and let\u2019s go. And you feel like you can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">CLIENT: Well, he could tell that I was mad. Not mad. He could tell that I was aggravated.  Worked-up. And by the time he was feeling more with it, almost by the time appointments were all over, he was trying to cheer me up. Because he could tell I was not doing the best that day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: So, where does that pent up sort of aggravation go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: (sighs) I don\u2019t know. I mean, on Monday, I really had to work. And I really, really also need to go run or something. Because I just couldn\u2019t finish work and run. And I usually would prioritize running or something, but I didn\u2019t, because I really was more worried about work. And then, I got <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">home, and Josh was like, \u201cPlease take an Ativan. I can\u2019t watch you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">So, it either goes\u2014it\u2019s either helped by (ph) drugs or running.  Although, at this point, I\u2019m pretty tired. And so, I ran yesterday and it just felt awful. And I\u2019ve been starting to feel uncomfortable when I\u2014I\u2019m just trying to hang out, which is not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Uncomfortable, like, restless, keyed-up uncomfortable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Relaxing is not relaxing. Even though I went for a run yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, because I think that pent-up feeling sounds like it\u2019s pretty on-target, because there\u2019s all this\u2014yeah, irritation and annoyance and frustration pent up inside you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:16:44) and that leads to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: And if it has no place to go. Yeah, if you could get in a (inaudible at 00:16:48) showing that to Josh. You\u2019d feel probably like you had vented a lot of it. But I know that there are obvious reasons why that\u2019s not exactly how you want to let go of it.  So, if we can find maybe another way <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">to be able to let go of some of that pent-up hostility. You have good reasons to be mad at a lot of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:17:13) and this morning, when he was just freaking out about his leg and was just miserable, I just wanted to leave. And I did. Just leave him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: [You had to just] (ph) escape it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: (chuckle) And I went to\u2014I actually went to a yoga class that turned out to be really not a good one. I was so mad through the whole yoga class. Because I left him to go try to relax and it was \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, and it\u2019s not working. So how dare it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: You can\u2019t really just\u2014I suppose you could get up and walk out of a yoga class. But then, nothing would be helped. And I\u2019d feel bad about doing that. So, that just makes me more frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it makes you more frustrated, because you feel like you don\u2019t have any options at that point. The option you took didn\u2019t work. The option of leaving doesn\u2019t really feel like a good one. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: So, when was the last time that you got (ph) to yell and scream and cry and stamp your feet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, getting really drunk with my little brother, whom I can just say anything to on Friday was really nice. It was not yelling and screaming, but it was \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Well, maybe that\u2019s not what you need. Maybe, I mean, that was sort of my inclination. (chuckles) But maybe you don\u2019t need to yell and scream and cry. Maybe you need to be able to say anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, I can to Josh, sometimes. When he\u2019s feeling okay. (crosstalk at 00:18:40)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not completely free. You have to wait for the right time, which might not always match up with when you feel like you really needed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Also, after he started crying over being so comfortable in the bed, we agreed tonight to try sleeping in the bed together, because I can\u2019t have him crying over how comfortable the bed is and then sleeping on the couch just because of me.  (sighs) So, I mean, I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m a little nervous <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">about that. And I don\u2019t think that I cannot sleep and yell at him and freak out, like I have before. When I wake up in the middle of the night because he\u2019s snoring or something, I can\u2019t freak out at him. Or maybe I will, just because I don\u2019t care. But just could lead to more trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Well, what can you do to\u2014so, if he\u2019s going to\u2014if you guys are going to sleep in the same bed tonight, what can you do to maybe help push it in the right direction so that it\u2019s actually a good first night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s just really that he\u2019s a really loud beeps and things. So, I have the best earplugs I can get, which don\u2019t work 100 percent. And then, the fans. I\u2019m just going to \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Mmm, yeah. So, you use all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: probably take some drugs and hope for the best. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: And take your Ativan. Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: (sighs) Because hopefully, if he can get a good night\u2019s sleep and be comfortable, he\u2019ll be better.  But I don\u2019t know. I was hoping you could give me some magical way to separate my feelings from his, but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, you love him. So, unless you were to stop caring about him, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a complete separation of your feelings. I don\u2019t think you really want there to be. I think it is okay for you to have some separation of your feelings when you need. Being able to say <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201011\">\u201cI need a break. I\u2019m going to go leave for an hour for a class,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m going to work for the morning.\u201d It\u2019s okay for you to escape and give yourself permission to go escape, whether it\u2019s for work or to just go take a walk or . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I have been. But it hasn\u2019t been enough to not feel all worked up. So, I don\u2019t know.  Maybe the Zoloft will help again. I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I think part of it is we do\u2014I think we do need to find a way for you to be able to let go of some of that pent-up aggression that it makes sense that you have. But feeling blocked from being able to get it out and let go of it is\u2014I think that\u2019s\u2014chronically, that\u2019s a problem. Sometimes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201051\">there are things that we can\u2019t address. But to feel like there\u2019s so much that could happen in any given week that you can\u2019t express, that you need to somehow subdue, whether it\u2019s because he\u2019s really struggling or because you don\u2019t want to yell and scream at the nurses for screwing up. Yelling at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201052\">blood thinners doesn\u2019t really do anything. But there are all these things that you want to be mad at.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:21:57) I don\u2019t even know how to be mad at what\u2019s happening because\u2014yeah, I mean, it\u2019s just this situation.

Maybe I should do martial arts instead of yoga or something. (chuckles) (crosstalk at 00:22:13)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I mean, you might want to experiment. Maybe that would help make\u2014I mean, you\u2019re a pretty physical person. Right? You experience things very much in your body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And (crosstalk at 00:22:24), yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: So, maybe it would help to experiment with other ways of letting go of some that aggression. Maybe a boxing class would be awesome for you. Maybe some sort of martial arts would be an avenue to release some of that pent-up aggression. We want to search for as a constructive way to let you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">let go. The feelings make total sense. Getting in a fight with a random stranger or screaming at Josh is probably going to have other consequences that are just as unhelpful as the pent-up feelings and (ph) frustrations. We want to find an adaptive way of letting go of them without creating another problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t know what to do when running doesn\u2019t\u2014when I\u2019m too tired to run. That\u2019s (ph) always been a problem. I don\u2019t think I ever (crosstalk at 00:23:09).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: Right, because running is awesome, but when you\u2019re not sleeping \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: that it\u2019s\u2014that it doesn\u2019t feel satisfying or it doesn\u2019t feel good to your body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, I\u2019m still entirely sure why I\u2019m not sleeping. I had that terrible dream about bringing Josh home from the hospital. I don\u2019t know why. Or why one night, I woke up in the middle of the night. I just (inaudible at 00:23:32) because of this frustration or if there\u2019s something <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B1\">else going on. I\u2019m drinking too much coffee. I don\u2019t know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Both of things make sense. See if you can experiment with some other types of exercise, since exercise has been useful for you. Maybe that\u2019s a realistic place to start. I mean, I know in the past, you\u2019ve also talked about\u2014tapping into any of your senses might help.  Some people find it a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D1\">real release to listen to certain types of music. Or some people find a real release through art. You\u2019ve got to match it with you. There\u2019s no one right way.

Yeah. But, I mean, so, I mean, intuition led you there. Who knows why? But it did. So, let\u2019s trust it. (chuckles) And, yeah, maybe a keyboard is a worthwhile purchase. Or go to a music store around here and try it out. See how it feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah. My mom has a keyboard. I wonder if I told her that my therapist said to borrow it (inaudible at 00:25:43).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: I will write you a script if you want one. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: Because she has a nice one that she uses for her jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: Well, I bet you could certainly try it out. See if it gives you\u2014see if it is a form of release for you. And if it works?  I\u2019ll write you a script.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:26:07) this is a good idea. Because the thought of doing anything when there\u2019s a scheduled class time \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

So, I think, paying attention to that gut reaction is\u2014trust that. You don\u2019t want to add another stressor. And if a scheduled class feels like a stressor, then that\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s not room for more stress right now. If it\u2019s something that you could just pick up when you felt like you had <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201391\">the need might fit the bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And were asking me if I would ever play the violin, because I used to play (inaudible at 00:27:10). My mom\u2019s a music teacher. And I told them absolutely not. (chuckles) I don\u2019t have time. (chuckles) So I\u2019ll have to (crosstalk at 00:27:20).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: Well, it doesn\u2019t have to be a practiced way. Right? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re getting back to an instrument and you want to perfect it. It\u2019s like (inaudible at 00:27:27) on the keys and create some sound.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20143\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20145\">THERAPIST: And it might be a way to tap into some of what you\u2019re feeling and get it out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20147\">CLIENT: But if I borrow, then they\u2019ll be really excited (inaudible at 00:27:41) music and stuff.

Put it in a folder. If you don\u2019t want to play any of that, keep it folded up in the folder.

They\u2019re not always right there and available. But I would call one of them if it was something I particularly needed to talk to somebody about. I don\u2019t know.

I know that some of you peers at school have expectations on you to holding up some of your end of the bargain, with work. Even that\u2019s been somewhat relieved but not entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s also gotten worse, because we\u2019re going in a month to a meeting and there\u2019s been a lot of pressure. And usually, school pressure is fine, but it\u2019s just\u2014I don\u2019t have enough space for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: But you don\u2019t have the same resources that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: you used to have to be able to meet those demands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: So, I mean, it could just \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have the\u2014it used to be, you had unscheduled days where you\u2019d put that work in.

But now, there are so many more constraints on your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: I mean, it could just be work that\u2019s causing me to go over the edge of being not worked up. But I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m liking it. It\u2019s not. But it is really stressful. I need to solve it in a month, so I don\u2019t know. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I don\u2019t know. I mean, I hope it works itself out. But this past week has been a little (inaudible at 00:31:58) if I don\u2019t sleep through the night a couple nights, I freak out.  Which I wish I didn\u2019t, but it probably just makes it all worse. And I think about what I\u2019m going to say to you, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F1\">and that makes it worse.

I guess I forgot we had put up a wall or something that I forgot about (crosstalk at 00:33:47). Maybe I just need\u2014it\u2019s almost\u2014maybe it\u2019s almost a little self-indulgent to just become more anxious. It\u2019s an easy path.

Those are useful skills that you have. The \u201cwhy\u201d question is very circular. And it doesn\u2019t always\u2014why aren\u2019t you sleeping? Well there\u2019s probably a gazillion reasons. And we\u2019re never going to know exactly which one it <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201911\">is. Right now, it\u2019s not consistent. Right? I mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been having insomnia for days on end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">THERAPIST: You had some bad nights, and that\u2019s concerning because you have had periods of time where it is really consistently insomnia. And so, I can see why it makes you\u2014I can understand why it makes you anxious. But asking yourself why probably doesn\u2019t help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:34:47) about something\u2014I want to change something . . .

Are you not with me, here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I guess it\u2019s just hard to accept that there just be random bad nights. I must have done something wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Well, can we experiment and see if it is possible to have some random (inaudible at 00:35:34) nights that aren\u2019t your fault in any way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, I don\u2019t know how I stop from having those thoughts, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Well, so we do the adaptive test. Is it useful? So, when you start asking yourself questions about something that\u2019s happened, whether it be a freak-out or a not-sleeping. Instead of answering a question, you ask a different question, which is, \u201cIs it useful for me to be trying to figure this <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A11\">out?\u201d  And if it\u2019s useful, then, okay. If it\u2019s causing you more anxiety, that\u2019s not useful. Right? You don\u2019t need extra anxiety. So, if it\u2019s not useful, that\u2019s when the wall goes up. And you say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve thought about it enough, because spending more time on it isn\u2019t really helping me, actually.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A12\">And that was the wall thing that we had used in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">THERAPIST: And the way we got to it was figuring out\u2014sometimes, being thoughtful is really useful. Sometimes, being thoughtful is circular and it\u2019s not getting you anywhere. So, if it\u2019s not getting you anywhere, then, you put up the wall and you go down another path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s also that physical feeling of\u2014it\u2019s almost like someone\u2019s grabbing your chest or something, which is what keeps from relaxing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think that\u2019s some\u2014that physical feeling, you really is your way of experiencing anxiety. Right? Because grabbing your chest is probably\u2014there\u2019s probably a lot of things associated with that. Probably shortened breath. And so, if can try to expand your breath when you start to feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A91\">that, it\u2019s a way to resist that feeling. And you can see that with the wall. As soon as the wall goes up, it protects you from further thought which is anxiety-producing. So, you can put that wall up, and on the other side of it, there\u2019s lot of room to take nice, deep breaths. Go down another path that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A92\">not threatening. Able to relax the muscles that surround your rib cage so that doesn\u2019t have to feel tight.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.

It\u2019s kind of nice to do it with him and sort of sad to do it myself, because it feels a little hopeless just to daydream <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C11\">on my own (crosstalk at 00:39:50).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Well, when you\u2019re not some\u2014being able to envision yourself having a path be\u2014being able to envision yourself doing something that you really like or would feel really empowered by.  Being successful someplace, whether it be at work or finishing a race or planting a garden or something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C31\">you felt like maybe was more realistic right now. Those are things you can do, because they don\u2019t involve Josh having a great day, which you have no control over. Or when the transplant will happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know if I have any good daydreams on my own at the moment. (crosstalk at 00:40:37) (chuckles) THERAPIST: So, maybe the path is to start creating one. It might be fun to play with what you can do on your own as\u2014and enjoy on your own that you would have more control over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">CLIENT: I did. Actually, I did daydream a little bit about\u2014Yale was having a free trip that they sent out to visit policy institutions in Philadelphia I was like, \u201cOh, no, I can\u2019t go on that,\u201d because I\u2019d have to arrange someone to take care of Josh.  And then, I was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just going to apply.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C71\">And then I did daydream about it a little bit. And then, I got rejected, because they had filled up, so . . . (chuckles) sad. But I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C9\">THERAPIST: But maybe you could daydream about the next one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, if I daydream too much about my career, then I start to feel so trapped by the current situation. Maybe I could just try not to think about. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Well, and maybe practicing\u2014part of a daydream is that it doesn\u2019t have to be realistic. Right? So, when you start daydreaming about something and then you feel constrained by the current situation, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve started to plan instead of dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CF\">CLIENT: Right. Well, me, I don\u2019t know how to separate the two. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D1\">THERAPIST: Mmm. And so, well, it\u2019s just a matter of practice. It\u2019s about dreaming about something with no limitations.  And when you start to plan and notice where reality might get in the way of your dream, you get to say to yourself, \u201cI don\u2019t have to be realistic, here. I get to have exactly what <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D11\">I want.\u201d Because it\u2019s a dream. Dreams are about having exactly what you want. I mean, if you think about the famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. If Martin Luther King had looked at what the reality of the (ph) situation was in the day that he was writing his speech and what he wanted \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D3\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D5\">THERAPIST: very hard to see a path from here, where he was, to there. Right? But he let himself dream. It was a dream. \u201cThis is what I see as being fair and equal in the world that I would create.\u201d Didn\u2019t have to be realistic in the moment. It was still really inspirational and important. And when <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D51\">you\u2019re feeling anxious and trapped, being able to give yourself a little of your own inspiration just to have the nice dream. You don\u2019t have to know how you\u2019re going to get from here to there.  You don\u2019t plan out the whole Civil Rights Movement. (chuckles) You can just dream about what you really want <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D52\">and allow yourself to feel what you\u2019d feel if you had it. And you don\u2019t stay in the dream forever. It\u2019s just a pathway to get out of where you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D7\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll try.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And it\u2019s about the process. Right? This is not a goal-oriented exercise. It\u2019s about the process. So, you try and that\u2019s it. My belief is that if you can notice those moments where you\u2019re starting to feel that tightness in your chest, and you notice that you\u2019re caught in a loop of thought <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D91\">that\u2019s not helping you, and you can take a little bit of time to take some deep breaths and dream about something for yourself? That\u2019s enough to move you from one moment to the next, where you might be feeling something different. And that\u2019s all it has to do. It doesn\u2019t have to solve any problems.  <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201D92\">It just has to move you to the next piece of your day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB\">CLIENT: Is it sort of a cop-out that something like Ativan makes that so much easier?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s where you are right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">CLIENT: Because that sounds so hard. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It is. It is hard. And Ativan\u2019s not a cop out. Ativan is one of the tools in your bag. It can\u2019t be your only tool, because you can\u2019t use it all the time. But it\u2019s appropriate for it to be one of the tools in your bag to use. And so, you use that sometimes. And then, you use these other <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E11\">techniques other times. When they work, you\u2019ll (ph) get easier. And when you have lots of different tools to use, it\u2019s\u2014I think that\u2019s a safer situation to be in, rather than only having one thing that works for you.  Right? Because it\u2019s like (inaudible at 00:45:02) works. You went to yoga and class <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E12\">sucked and you\u2019re stuck. (chuckles) You want to have something else to go to. (chuckles) You want to know, \u201cOkay. If the next yoga class I walk into sucks, I am going to get up and walk out quietly and go do my other thing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201E0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561837\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah. I wish I have (ph). I mean, I guess drugs, Ambien rarely works as well as it used to anymore, so (inaudible at 00:45:24) stop working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E5\">THERAPIST: They can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E7\">CLIENT: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201E9\">THERAPIST: They usually don\u2019t stop working completely. I mean, I don\u2019t want you to fear that it\u2019s going to be something that only works for a little bit, and then never again. But, yeah. The drugs have a downside in that they can lose some effectiveness. You can build up a tolerance to some drugs. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E91\">then, it doesn\u2019t work as well, or you need to take more to get the same effect. And a lot of the anti-anxiety meds are habit forming. And when used correctly, you don\u2019t have to worry about it so much. But if it\u2019s the only thing you have to rely on, it\u2019s really easy to\u2014it\u2019s easier to use it in the way <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201E92\">that\u2019s not going to be good for you long term. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB\">CLIENT: Well, it definitely adds to anxiety when I have\u2014when I go up on Zoloft, it makes me feel bizarrely good and then (crosstalk at 00:46:10) stop for \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201ED\">THERAPIST: You get nervous.

(inaudible at 00:46:20) \u201cHow could I have felt so good and (inaudible at 00:46:22) this was how it was going to be?

And that was really terrible, when I first started taking Zoloft, because I felt so good. And then, I had the same insomnia come back. That (ph) was really disappointing and I completely forgot about that until this whole (crosstalk at 00:46:40).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Until you had that week of feeling so good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F7\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.

Well, I\u2019m sorry it felt stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FB\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, it\u2019s so nice.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20201\">THERAPIST: Maybe on the right dose, it would. I don\u2019t know how much more room there is, but I know Linda said that you had been on a pretty low dose. So, there may be more room to go up. And maybe finding the right dose might be where it stays good for a lot longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20203\">CLIENT: Well, I have to talk to her if there is any reason that\u2014because it definitely\u2014it gave me more energy, if that would keep me from sleeping. Because then, I had started taking it later in the day so it didn\u2019t hurt my stomach. (chuckles) But, I know I\u2019m still taking a small dose. She said I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202031\">go up to like 400. I\u2019m only on 75. I can\u2019t imagine (inaudible at 00:47:41) taking 400 (chuckles) but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20205\">THERAPIST: So, that\u2019s a really wide range. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20207\">CLIENT: And I think 400 would be for the biggest person ever. (inaudible at 00:47:50) dose. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what it seemed like, but . . . THERAPIST: Well, usually, also, use them different for depression versus obsessive thought. Right?  For obsessions, they usually use really higher doses of <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202071\">those medications. So, it\u2019s not just about weight, but also about look what are you actually targeting with the med. But, I mean, clearly, there\u2019s lots of room. Not that you would necessarily ever go up to that high dose, but there\u2019s a lot of room for movement. If this isn\u2019t working, then that becomes <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202072\">part of the conversation that you have with her. What\u2019s the next step for you? And that dramatic rise and fall that you feel when you have a switch. What does that mean? Does that mean that you could be on a higher dose and not have\u2014have the risk without the fall? So, I think your first question to <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202073\">her is about the\u2014how many of the\u2014not Ambien.
