(pause) I kind of need a haircut. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Me too. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So I would a couple of days ago, but all of my friends are depressed; like all of them. And (pause) I was talking to Lucy about this; about how, you know, I had plans with Yvonne later this week, and I was really dreading it, because Yvonne\u2019s miserable about the divorce, and she feels like her <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">life is over, and she\u2019s behind on work; she does freelance writing and she also has a day job; like 25 hours a week. [0:01:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">But like whenever we hang out, it\u2019s just this constant stream of like, \u201cI can\u2019t write; I\u2019m so blogged; I have all these projects; they\u2019re all behind deadline; I feel so terrible; my house is a shithole. But no, don\u2019t help me clean it, because I\u2019m too embarrassed to let anyone help me clean it. But I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">just going to tell you about how miserable I am that it\u2019s a shithole.\u201d While we\u2019re sitting in the middle shithole, while I\u2019m sitting Lego\u2019s literally, because I can\u2019t put them away, because that would shame her. But like there are no places to sit that aren\u2019t covered in fucking Lego\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">And like her kid is misbehaved, but then she doesn\u2019t discipline her kid. I\u2019m also watching her, like actively not discipline her kid, while her kid is misbehaving while she\u2019s telling me that she\u2019s so miserable that her kid misbehaves. And like, it\u2019s just really draining and horrible. You know, (chuckle) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">Lucy put it, \u201cAre you familiar with the spoon metaphor for energy?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: (chuckle) So some disability activist wrote about it to describe what it\u2019s like to live with lupus. And it\u2019s just this, (inaudible at 0:02:37), but like, you have these physical tokens; let\u2019s call them spoons, like you\u2019re holding a handful of spoons from the silverware drawer. And every action <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">you do requires you to give up a spoon, and when you\u2019re out of the handful of spoons, you\u2019re just done for the day; you can\u2019t do anything more. You can\u2019t go out, you can\u2019t read the Internet, you can\u2019t cook dinner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you\u2019re done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Done. Days are (burnt) (ph), so like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: It stinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. So the metaphor is, you know, how many spoons do you have? Are there a lot of spoons? Lucy (chuckle) made the analogy that, hanging out with Yvonne is like having Yvonne take all of my spoons and drops them down the garbage disposal. (chuckle) And that I should not make myself the patron <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">martyr of like horribly mangled spoons dropped down the disposal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">She kind of had a point. But like, (pause) I tell her that I care about; and more importantly, everyone I lean on for emotional support, is also like horribly depressed, and like feels like their life is spinning out of control; is miserable. [0:03:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">Last night, I had an hour long conversation with my friend Vanessa, who just gotten tenure last week after like years of working towards it. But she feels like a failure, because she hasn\u2019t published enough papers, and she had to step down from like some leadership position in her department. And she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">going through another divorce, and her kid is severely autistic. Because her kids\u2019 therapist had been embezzling the insurance for like six years, the government decided that all of his therapist patients were going to be denied services, because they\u2019re not really sick. And she has to restart the whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">evaluation and diagnostic process over with a new therapist. I was like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562370\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">She\u2019s got a lot of horrible circumstances going on, but like she spent any hour telling me about she\u2019s an academic failure, when she just got tenure. She\u2019s deeply depressed, like borderline suicidally depressed, and I don\u2019t really know what I can do to help her, other than encourage her to go find a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">therapist of her own, which I have been doing. [0:04:53]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">(chuckle) But it\u2019s not helping me at all to like spend an hour on phone with someone who is telling me in detail about their suicidal ideations. (pause) But you know, this is someone I\u2019ve been friends with for a long time and who I care about. (pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t \u2013 none of my friends are happy and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">it sucks. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">I really miss Ashley, and I realize that part of it; well I mean, part of it is just that you know, I\u2019m still half in love with him, and part of it is, you know, the physical and sexual aspect of the relationship. And certainly part of it was, in spite of knowing intellectually, that he was really depressed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">and miserable, and has been for quite awhile, he fakes being okay really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">So when we were on dates, he would pretend everything was normal, and he didn\u2019t talk about his depression the way all of my other friends did.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Well, one thing that (pause) seems to be (pause) (inaudible at 0:07:27), but that seems to be true in the way you\u2019re describing Yvonne and Vanessa sort of talking to you, (pause) you\u2019d also know you\u2019re talking about it, is (pause) it\u2019s a little more show than tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: You know like with Yvonne, you see it all over the place, (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: And you sort of see it demonstrated in how she talks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not exactly what she\u2019s talk \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what she\u2019s talking about or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: No, it is. Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: How so? [0:08:28]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Like, I mean, she\u2019ll talk about how she\u2019s feeling, about how she\u2019ll say, you know, \u201cI\u2019m miserable, because Christopher is yelling at me to move my stuff out of his apartment faster. And I really can\u2019t, because I don\u2019t have any \u2013 because I don\u2019t have the time, and have this job, and I\u2019m behind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">on my deadlines, and it feels miserable that I\u2019m behind on my deadlines. Every time I sit down to write, I have panic attacks, and I\u2019m just on floor crying.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">And then as she\u2019s saying this, she\u2019ll be like crying, and it\u2019s just \u2013 yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause) I guess something related that I like about Vanessa is the spoon metaphor. I\u2019m sorry, Lucy\u2019s spoon metaphor, is (pause) the garbage disposal doesn\u2019t digest spoons; it just mangles them. [0:10:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And there\u2019s that kind of feeling what you\u2019re describing like, (pause) Vanessa and Yvonne seem kind of mangled, like they\u2019re not \u2013 this stuff is just racking them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: And what they\u2019re saying is racking you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not like, this may be happening, but it\u2019s not the affect that you\u2019re describing that like what they\u2019re feeling is getting metabolized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Or you\u2019re helping them metabolize it.

And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Like I wonder if there isn\u2019t just some kind of feedback link going on, that we\u2019re all depressed, and we all have stressful, unhappy things going on; just dwelling on it with each other is just kind of exacerbates the negative feelings for all of us; I don\u2019t know. [0:11:12] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well it also makes me think that maybe (pause) it feels like something similar here, that (pause) you kind of say these things, but it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m really taking in, or in some way helping you with how kind of overwhelmed and sort of chewed up you\u2019re feeling from all of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">Like you\u2019re saying it, but it\u2019s spinning around and around, more than it is like feeling as though \u2013 kind of like it\u2019s going anywhere. And I imagine part of how that works is, (pause) (sigh) probably that there\u2019s something it feels like; I know you may well be missing about what this feels like to you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">to be listening to them. [0:12:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Like it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s exhausting, and then guilty for being exhausted by it. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: And more, it sounds gut wrenching. You know, I mean, (pause) And there\u2019s something very parallel that seems like also characteristic of the way that this is disturbing. How old is Yvonne\u2019s kid? Like five or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Five, or six or something like that; yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I mean to see a kid that age, and sort of that vulnerable and out of control. [0:13:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: With a mother who\u2019s so passive and helpless,<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right. Well the kids\u2019 father isn\u2019t any better, and neither of them disciplines her. And in part, because they both came from abusive authoritarian households, and so they\u2019re both terrified that they -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re reacting, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: If they ever like say no, or exert any discipline, or try to take control of her behavior in any way, that they\u2019ll tip over the line into abusive with her -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m really \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 this probably sounds weird, but my intent is not to be critical of her as a mom so much as to say, I imagine it\u2019s terribly disturbing to watch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: And more so because, you both know it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Like she\u2019s not containing the kid at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: No. And like it\u2019s super frustrating when we hang out, and like when she has the kid, because we can\u2019t actually have a grown-up conversation, because the kid interrupts, like every 30 seconds, and needs constant attention at times. [0:15:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right. And that\u2019s expectable for like a two or three-year-old, but not so much with a six-year-old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well with two or three-year-olds, you\u2019d expect them to be asleep by 9:00 at night, which Madison didn\u2019t like, they\u2019ve never had a consistent bedtime for her either, which doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve been over at their place like when we split up, at like 11:30, midnight, and the kid would still <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">be awake and hanging out and watching TV. And it\u2019s just like not \u2013 I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do when she starts school in the fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Does the mom or \u2013 yeah, the mom does have a therapist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: The therapist or something [need a file] (ph).

And like in the past, I\u2019ve tried saying, you know, Madison, I\u2019m having a grown-up calm conversation with your mom, please don\u2019t interrupt. Like not stepping into the role of disciplining her, but like speaking to her as I would to another adult.

It\u2019s just like there\u2019s no \u2013 I mean I guess there <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">is no reasoning with, you know, a kindergartner no matter what, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: There can be.

You know, you can say that, and they\u2019re like, okay. (chuckle) I mean you know, neither really work out or something, but you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">say that.

But the bedtime ritual lasted an hour <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">and a half, and there was the peeing, and brushing the teeth, and then demanding a snack, and then brushing teeth again, and then demanding water, and then demanding a story, and then coming out of the room, and demanding more water, then wanting another story, because now she was out of bed. And at <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200932\">one point she insisted she wanted me to read her a story. [0:18:27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">They both just kind of looked at me helplessly, and were like could you go read her a story please?

Like it\u2019s disruptive and it\u2019s stressful, especially the kid starts shrieking like high-pitched loud wailing, and it\u2019s just like it\u2019s pitiful to be over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Parenting a regular little kid looks different from what they\u2019re doing. I mean it\u2019s not obvious from this, but I mean I\u2019m child trained, and I until a few years ago, saw kids, you know, and (inaudible at 0:19:51). Parenting; it can be incredibly hard, and hard to know how hard it can be to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">parent a difficult kid, but that\u2019s not what it looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">You know, if they were there sort of going through the ritual, and trying to fit the limits, and you know whatever timeouts, or something, and all of that, and the kid was still going nuts, that\u2019s one thing. If the kid was autistic, and they like had some elaborate structure that the kid just could <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">not fit into, but they were trying, you know, that would be one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562370\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">Or the kid was incredibly anxious, and just comes out of the bed every ten minutes, because they\u2019re, you know, afraid of a ghost or something, and they sort of are gentle, but firm, that\u2019s different. This is not that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I mean it didn\u2019t sound like they had anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: No. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And that \u2013 yeah. [0:20:57] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: And like I\u2019ve tried suggesting to Yvonne that we hang out on nights when she doesn\u2019t have the kid, but on nights when she doesn\u2019t have the kid, she\u2019s usually like going to lectures, or like going to events that she\u2019s going to be reporting on, or in the office late working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">So she doesn\u2019t want to hang out on nights that she doesn\u2019t have Madison. And I\u2019ve tried suggesting, well just hire a babysitter; I\u2019ll pay for the babysitter, and let\u2019s go out for dinner. But, you know, then she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know, Madison only sees me part of the time, and I don\u2019t really want the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">babysitter, and Christopher might use that against me in the divorce proceedings.\u201d She\u2019s worried that Christopher is going to try to get full custody of Madison with only supervised visits for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">Frankly, I kind of see her point, and if I were Christopher, I sure as hell would want full custody with only supervised visits for her, because she\u2019s not like \u2013 Christopher is also permissive, and doesn\u2019t discipline the kid, but at least like he keeps his house clean, and the kid isn\u2019t living in filth.

And she hoped that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">maybe now, Madison would learn a lesson about peeing in the bed; having to sleep in pissed-smelling sheets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">And I was just like so horrified; so immensely horrified, like, \u201cSure, you want to teach your kid not to wet the bed.\u201d And since Madison had been sleeping completely dry for like two years, like, it\u2019s pretty clearly acting out, because she\u2019s unhappy about the divorce. But the answer is not have your <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">kid sleep in sheets that smelled like piss; like that\u2019s just awful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: And I know it wasn\u2019t like deliberately vindictive, or deliberately intended as a punishment, but you know, she just really couldn\u2019t cope with like doing another load of laundry. But still, like \u2013 (pause) Yeah, if Madison were my kid, I wouldn\u2019t want Yvonne to have \u2013 even have full custody.

You know, either by telling her that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E71\">you don\u2019t want to see her, or don\u2019t want see her without the babysitter. Or though you don\u2019t necessarily think her kid should be with her ex, that, you know, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019d be her friend, if you didn\u2019t tell her you thought you could handle her kid, you know, she shouldn\u2019t handle her kid. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E72\">Whatever; some kind of limit that would also help to protect you.

I told her, \u201cYou need a lawyer; you need to split the assets now; you need to have bank account in your name.\u201d And she didn\u2019t listen; she was like \u201cChristopher and I were <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">together for ten years, and he loves me, and he cares about me, and he wouldn\u2019t screw me over.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">Now he\u2019s like, not giving her the password to their joint account; like he changed the password; won\u2019t give it to her; drained it; put most of the funds in a private account for him. And like, he\u2019s been a total asshole, and she was trying to negotiate with him and his lawyer on her own, and like she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB1\">has screwed herself over financially, and even though she has legal counsel, I\u2019m like she\u2019s not going to get as much financially as she could have.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562370\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

And she, I don\u2019t know, from where I\u2019m standing, it looks like she emotionally coerced him and belittled him into going to counseling with her.
