Like I think the Seder being over helped it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20011\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20013\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014\">CLIENT: But now I'm actually, because I talked to my Mom about the whole housemate situation an she said that like - I mean, first she had made some sort of, from the outside good suggestions but from the inside bad suggestions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20015\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016\">THERAPIST: Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20017\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018\">CLIENT: Like, \"Why don't you?\" I mean, okay, so abolishing communal dinners might help except we'd still have to have people do dishes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20019\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C\">CLIENT: And my Mom was like, \" Well, why don't you have the people be responsible for their own dishes that they make during the day?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001D\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20020\">CLIENT: And I was like, \"That's what we're supposed to be doing. We have had this discussion multiple times. It never gets fixed.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20023\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024\">CLIENT: And, you know, Eliza (ph) and Aimee are leaving and I will be the only one who is responsible and gets anything done. And I can't deal with pressure. And so when my Mom said it might be okay then to move into a new apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20025\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20026\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20027\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028\">CLIENT: But then I have to pack and, you know, Sydney' stuff is still in my room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20029\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:22)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002B\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C\">CLIENT: Yeah, it does. And I'm not sure whether or not I'd be able to get everything. And even if I do find a place, then I have to find a place like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002D\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030\">CLIENT: I mean, I think it probably, you know, I think it might be the right choice. So then, you know, a few days later I was sort of second guessing myself. I'm like, \"Oh maybe I could just stay. Maybe it won't be that bad. Maybe it was just over stress.\" But (sigh) (pause) really no one else is good <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200301\">about doing their chores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20031\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20033\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034\">CLIENT: And it's really a big problem. I guess if we just had, you know, stopped being communal altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20035\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20037\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038\">CLIENT: Except for like, you know, buying our food together and such that like people can eat things, but no longer having the chore cycle or something. And if I'm making money I could, in theory at this point, once Eliza (ph) and Aimee are gone <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20039\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A\">THERAPIST: When are they leaving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003B\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003C\">CLIENT: Their lease in the new place starts on April 15th, but they're probably moving out around May 5th, they said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003D\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E\">THERAPIST: Mm. So soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003F\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040\">CLIENT: Yeah. So very, very soon. And even now (ph) Aaron's like, \"Oh, I don't even know if I have money to renovate.\" Like do the renovations of Eliza (ph) and Suzanna's apartment. So after all that. You know, and it's not like he's going to be able to save us much money when he's only having three <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200401\">people besides him renting. And (pause) but once they leave it'll be bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20041\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042\">And I don't know what I was going to say before, but (pause) Oh. But once they're gone, Aimee, right now, is the only one in the house who doesn't have a job. So everybody in the house has a job. So maybe we could pay for people to, you know, once a month clean the bathrooms and the kitchen floor. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200421\">Well, except that the <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20043\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044\">THERAPIST: Are these things other people are interested in doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20045\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046\">CLIENT: Um. We haven't had the discussion in a while. Well before Ryan (ph) moved in. Like it had come up before, but at the time I was unemployed. And I'm like, \"Yeah, I can't spend.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20045-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20047\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20049\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A\">CLIENT: All, well, like more of my parents money on this. But it is something we could bring up again. Though it wouldn't solve the dish problem. And it wouldn't solve the problem, like if we only had them come in once a month, it wouldn't solve the problem of like Joshua throws all the food on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004A1\">floor all the time. And it gets really disgusting and like having to clean it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C\">THERAPIST: There's still some daily maintenance that needs to be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, four people will be going through less dishes, so maybe we wouldn't be emptying the dishwasher all the time. But we still would need to clean out the fridges and do other things. But, yeah, I think if we could stop the whole communal meal thing it would be a lot easier. And also <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E1\">Aimee is doing a lot of the grocery shopping now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050\">So I'm not sure who would do it because Aaron would be the one to logically do it if he had time. But he's forgetful about things and stuff. So I don't know if he'd be able to, you know, if we say we're out of milk, go and get milk. Because Aimee has a bike with big baskets on it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20051\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052\">THERAPIST: Mm. So she's been responsible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20053\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20054\">CLIENT: So she's been responsible for the local, stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20055\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056\">THERAPIST: Well when we talked a few week ago on the phone, and the idea of moving and the discomfort with your apartment came up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20057\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20059\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A\">THERAPIST: One of the things that you were feeling anxious about was feeling the responsibility to be there to do your chores and to cook, but not really spending much time there otherwise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005C\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005E\">THERAPIST: But another piece that seemed to be motivating it was that your boyfriend expressed feeling really uncomfortable in your house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which sometimes he still does. Like he's been okay with being over for Passover and stuff. But, you know, it would make sense that he'd want to be at his place during the week while I'm at my, well when I'm at work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20061\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20062\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20063\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064\">CLIENT: Because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20065\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20066\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20067\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20068\">CLIENT: You know? Though if I take the car, he is capable of taking the T to his place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20069\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006C\">CLIENT: You know, or a cab or something. It's just that like he doesn't always want to and he feels stuck. But that shouldn't be my problem. I mean, because if he I'd have to wake up earlier and it would be kind of out of the way to go from my place, drop him off at his place, at like seven o'clock <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006C1\">in the morning and then go to work. But, I mean, it would be <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E\">THERAPIST: So how much of moving would be to solve his problem, and how much of it would be to solve yours?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070\">CLIENT: Um. (pause) Probably thirty\/seventy, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20071\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072\">THERAPIST: And does that feel right for you? There's no right or wrong answer here, this is about what works and feels right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20073\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074\">CLIENT: I don't know. Because there's a part of me that thinks, \"Oh, I should save up money.\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20075\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20076\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20077\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20078\">CLIENT: And not spend all this money on being You know, wait until I have a job that actually pays enough to live off of before I get an apartment of my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20079\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007B\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C\">CLIENT: If I did have my own place it would be a lot better. Like a lot of those chores would be gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007D\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007E\">THERAPIST: Well fewer people creates less mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007F\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20080\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it's just like, you know, so many people are, like Aaron especially I think, is really bad about putting things in the sink and not soaking them when they really need to be soaked. And then it's Like I would know from my own dishes, like I could soak things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007F-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20081\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20082\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20083\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084\">CLIENT: You know, and if I didn't get my dishes done right away there'd be no one to say, \"Ah. There are dirty dishes in the sink.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20085\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20087\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20088\">CLIENT: Like things like that. And, you know, I guess that's really the big one. And, you know, especially if the fridge was all my own maybe I could do more of cooking things ahead of time to have multiple meals. And I guess there's nothing stopping me from doing Well, except I guess it's because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200881\">if I cook ahead of time just for me and make food and then I just heat up the other food, I'm not always having to wash the pots from making new food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20089\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008C\">CLIENT Which would not be the case at my current place because other people make their own pots. You know, and even because I did dishes on Saturday night and already the sink is full of all these dishes. And last night the meal that they had was a meat meal, and these are dairy dishes that are filling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008C1\">the sink. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008E\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20090\">CLIENT: So I don't know where they came from. But it's Passover and Aaron goes by the (ph) opinion that you can't use dishwashers that you use the rest of the year on Passover. You have to hand wash all our dishes. And the meat side we don't have any dishes to eat on, we use paper. But on the dairy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200901\">side we actually have real dishes and silverware and stuff that we have to wash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20091\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20092\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20093\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20094\">CLIENT: And I know (inaudible at 00:09:11). Theoretically, there are four of us who are supposed help out doing the cleaning on Tuesday night. But I feel like a lot of the dishes will fall to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20095\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20096\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20097\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20098\">CLIENT: And maybe I could make it less bad by doing them before Passover ends. But Passover becomes a lot bigger when you have [nine people in the house.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20099\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009A\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009B\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009C\">CLIENT: And the fact that we're like, \"Oh, we have to have both kitchens.\" You know? We don't. We really could just like have the meat kitchen be the one that we kasher and in the dairy kitchen, like for dairy stuff, just do paper plates and stuff for like matzo and cream cheese and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009D\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009E\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009F\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A0\">CLIENT: Because most of the things, at least most of the things that I Or maybe kasher the microwave and then we could make matzo pizza. Or the oven, which is self cleaning. Like we could do a lot less than we do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A1\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A2\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A3\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A4\">CLIENT: If people were more up to that, but they're not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A5\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A6\">THERAPIST: Well it has to be a group decision. And that's part of communal living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A7\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A8\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so the more stricter standards of Passover get, you know, put on there. And we didn't even have to do it that much for Passover, just in terms of chores for cleaning as opposed to cooking things. But it's still stressful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A9\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AA\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AB\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AC\">CLIENT: Like, I don't know. And the fact that at least soon Ryan (ph) will be graduating and we'll be moving somewhere. But not having someone live in the room next to me when there's a door in between the two rooms as opposed to just a wall. You can hear a lot and I feel like I don't have much privacy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AC1\">in my room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AD\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AE\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AF\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B0\">CLIENT: So that's also a problem.

And I'm going to want to work a bunch of Fridays <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B41\">to make up for all the days that I missed. So, yeah, it's really, like it's just so scary and I don't know what to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B3-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B5\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B6\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B7\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B8\">CLIENT: And maybe I should just let the status quo be and just continue to do stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B9\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BA\">THERAPIST: The change is scary?

It's fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C1\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C2\">THERAPIST: The scary part is organizing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C4\">CLIENT: The scary part is the logistics of it. Yeah, organizing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C5\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C6\">THERAPIST: What makes you doubt your ability to do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C7\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C8\">CLIENT: Well just a lack of space to put everything more than anything else. Like while I'm packing. You know, if there were an intermediate place where I could put boxes and stuff that would probably help a lot. It's just I have a lot of stuff right now in my room from lack of having adequate spaces <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C81\">to put in, that sort of like is on my desk in a pile (inaudible at 00:12:40).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C9\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CA\">You know, there are boxes on the floor and things that have piled up. And, you know, on the side of the bed that Sydney sleeps on he has a lot of stuff that, like because he's gotten into the habit of opening up packages and not recycling the boxes right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CB\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CC\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CD\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CE\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess I've had like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CF\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D0\">THERAPIST: It seems like that can be remedied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D1\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D2\">CLIENT: Yeah. If I could clean my room. I probably, you know, and I wouldn't even, if I hired movers then, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D4\">THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah. So there are ways to get help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D5\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D6\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's also a matter of finding a place and for me, well I guess, you know, maybe I'm real spoiled but I really would not want to live in a place that didn't have laundry in that building.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D7\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D8\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D9\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DA\">CLIENT: Like that's sort of a deal breaker for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DB\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DC\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DD\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE\">CLIENT: And if it had hookups, my parents would be willing to buy me a washer and a dryer. But if it doesn't then that would be a problem. Like at the old house we had to bring things to the laundromat and, you know, doing laundry was a big thing. And you only did it, you know, you'd go as long as you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DE1\">could without, you know, until you've used up all of whatever clothes (inaudible at 00:14:07), and then possibly buy more of those such that you can go longer without doing laundry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DF\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E0\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E1\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E2\">CLIENT: And then you'd have to drag everything over. And I guess it could be maybe I will use Sundays as a laundry day. But it seems like a really big hassle and I really would rather have my own laundry machines if there were hookups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E4\">THERAPIST: So it seems like you need to find out what's available before you start -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E5\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E6\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E7\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E8\">THERAPIST: deciding whether or not it's possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E9\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EA\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I've moved the time a little bit but I haven't had a chance to do much looking. And I'd have to, like I don't even, just also when looking for a place for Sydney, that was really difficult. And I'm just afraid it's going to be more of that again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EB\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EC\">THERAPIST: Mm. But you managed. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200ED\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EE\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, except that I found him a place with roommates.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200ED-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EF\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F0\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F1\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F2\">CLIENT: And so I'm trying to find a place just for me without roommates that's a reasonable cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F3\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F4\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. But you know how to look for an apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F5\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F6\">CLIENT: I do. Sort of. I mean I've never looked for an apartment on my own that I didn't get through knowing other people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F7\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F8\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F9\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FA\">CLIENT: Like junior year of college when I moved off campus I was living with someone else in the Jewish community. Senior year two of my friends were living in the apartment and they were leaving and through them I got in touch with the person who was subletting in it. And I got that apartment that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200FA1\">way. And then in the old house I knew Aaron and then I moved with Aaron to the new house. So I've never actually done the whole like meeting an agent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FB\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FC\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FD\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FE\">CLIENT: And scheduling a time, and going to the different places, and\/or like I've looked at things on Craigslist. But I don't know if Sydney had stricter apartments than I did or what not, but it was sort of (pause) yeah, I don't know. I guess it was harder to find places that were not super, duper expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FF\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20100\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20101\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20102\">CLIENT: And I don't know that he'd actually need more space than me, but I don't know why it was so difficult then. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20103\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20104\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20105\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20106\">CLIENT: I guess maybe because, especially because we were looking for a place in July or something, most places are June or September for move in available date. So maybe that was it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20107\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20108\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20109\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010A\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010B\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010C\">THERAPIST: But even in those circumstances you were able to find what you needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010D\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010E\">CLIENT: Sort of. But I've never actually for myself found an apartment from scratch. Or contacted people to look at apartments with or anything. Because I really don't want If I can't make it If I could make the house be less communal, if like other people agreed with me, which hopefully they would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010F\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20110\">THERAPIST: So do you have a house meeting set up where you can have that conversation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20111\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20112\">CLIENT: No. We don't. I'll have to send out an e-mail to get people to schedule one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20113\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20114\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Maybe that's your first step is finding out how are other people feeling amongst the people that are going to be there. And maybe there is interest in doing something along the lines of what you're interested in doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20115\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20116\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20117\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20118\">THERAPIST: It sounds like that would be the less stressful option for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20119\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011A\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011B\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011C\">THERAPIST: Make the house more compatible with what you're wanting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011D\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011E\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011F\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20120\">THERAPIST: If other people are not interested in that, then maybe it's time to look on Craigslist for apartments for rent or contact a real estate agent to help you sort through what's available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20121\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20122\">CLIENT: Hm. Yeah. I guess. (pause) It's like, I don't know. I think living on my own would be good for me maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20123\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20124\">THERAPIST: Hm. That sounds very hesitant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20125\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20126\">CLIENT: It's mostly the feeling guilty about spending the extra money. If I could find a place that had enough room for me in a not horrible location for the six hundred dollars a month plus utilities that I'm currently paying, that would be great. That is never going to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20127\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20128\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20129\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012A\">CLIENT: Like I'm sure that the prices have gone up. So if I want to be in the better locations it's really, really unlikely. If I had the money to buy a place so I wouldn't have to move, that would be really nice. But that's like, it will take <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20129-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012C\">Like even if I didn't have to spend any money currently. Like if I took my whole year's salary it would not be enough to make a down payment on a house or an apartment or anything like that. So there is no way I can do that in my current situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012E\">THERAPIST: Mm. It seems like you're realistic option is to talk with the housemates and see how other people are feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20130\">CLIENT: They might be less frustrated than me because they're not doing chores. And they won't be feeling like they're having to do extra chores because they're not even doing their own. But at least, I think, they would get the sense of like no one shows up for communal dinners anymore. We should stop <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201301\">doing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20131\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20132\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20133\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20134\">CLIENT: Like that might be. And if I don't have to cook then I could change the night I did dishes to Thursday nights. And then I'm not working on Friday and that would be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20135\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20136\">THERAPIST: That would be better for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20137\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20138\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like I'm okay with doing something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20139\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013A\">THERAPIST: Well let's take it one step at a time. You can't imagine what they are going to say or what they are going to feel. But you can schedule a meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013C\">CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe. I mean, it's just also really hard to pin everyone down. But we need to do that because things are about to fall apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013E\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20140\">CLIENT: And, I mean, if Eliza (ph) and Aimee are moving out in a month, what we have to It is (inaudible at 00:20:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20141\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20142\">THERAPIST: It needs to be changed anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20143\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20144\">CLIENT: Yeah, it has to get changed anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20145\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20146\">THERAPIST: So it makes a lot of sense to have a meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20147\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20148\">CLIENT: Yeah, and if people are not as interested in having there be a weekly Friday night dinner. We could keep the clean and people could make Friday night dinners if they wanted to. And if people care about them more then they can make more of them. And if they care about them less then, like it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201481\">might not be as even. But then, you know, I'd be okay cleaning up every other week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20149\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014B\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014C\">CLIENT: Like with someone else I would not be okay cleaning every other week and cooking every other week too, and having no weeks off. The cooking is usually what stresses me out most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014D\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014E\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014F\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20150\">CLIENT: So (pause) yeah, it really seems unsustainable. So, yeah, I think it would be a better system. And like the old house, that's what we, you know, we didn't have communal dinners. We had chores and people actually did do their own dishes. And well we had some chores. Like I was responsible for <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201501\">taking out the recycling and for emptying the dishwasher and stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20151\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20152\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20153\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20154\">CLIENT: But less people means less of a big deal. And I guess, yeah, the one thing is the whole Joshua throwing everything on the floor and Aaron never cleaning up the counter of the baby. It gets really gross. And that at least is solved by when someone is, you know, babysitting. Then he cleans it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201541\">because he also agrees about it being gross.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20155\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20156\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20157\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20158\">CLIENT: Whereas Aaron will just let all the dishes stay there and all the crumbled up food that's a mess. And yogurt and whatever, he will just leave it there. Which is so frustrating. I guess it doesn't really hurt me. I mean the food on the floor actually does affect me in that I have to wear sneakers <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201581\">into the kitchen or something. I can't go barefoot anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20157-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20159\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015B\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015C\">CLIENT: But, um. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015D\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015E\">THERAPIST: So that's one real big change is having a baby in the house and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015F\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20160\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because it's like I didn't want a baby. It's not my baby. It's not my responsibility. I shouldn't have to be cleaning up after it just because Aaron doesn't feel like it. It's one thing if you're a parent and you want the other parent to do all the work, and that's not fair. But it is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201601\">no way, shape or form my baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20161\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20162\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20163\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20164\">CLIENT: Joshua is not my baby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20165\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20166\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20167\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20168\">CLIENT: Joshua is Aaron's baby. I just happen to live in the same house. Aaron was the one who chose to have a child. Completely his choice. It wasn't like someone who gets pregnant unexpectedly. He went out and adopted a child. So he took on the extra responsibility, therefore he should be the one <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201681\">responsible for washing Joshua's high chair and sweeping up all the food that Joshua puts on the floor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20169\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016B\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016C\">CLIENT: And the fact that he doesn't do that is very frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016D\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016E\">THERAPIST: And now you're angry with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016F\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20170\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20171\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20172\">THERAPIST: Does he know that you're angry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20173\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20174\">CLIENT: I don't know. I've asked him before and sometimes he's gotten annoyed at me when I ask him to clean up the high chair. But it's just he shouldn't get annoyed. Like, you know, when Bridget was sleeping over there was the room, the bedroom was not the bedroom, the TV room because we don't have <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201741\">a guest bedroom anymore. The TV room was a complete and total mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20175\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20176\">And I asked Aaron to clean up Joshua's stuff. And he's like, \"Oh, well there's only, you know, a blanket and this rocker,\" or whatever. But like, no, all those torn up tissues on the floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20177\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20178\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20179\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017A\">CLIENT: That's Joshua crawling around and tearing up tissues on the floor. And in the end I ended getting Ryan (ph) to do it because his job is to sweep in there. But because it was not acceptable that I was having someone over who was sleeping there. It was not a place where one should have to sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017B\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017C\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017D\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017E\">CLIENT: Because Ryan (ph) had never done that chore of sweeping the floor in the TV room. So really everyone, like even my, sometimes I'm bad about like [falling down on fridge cleaning] (ph), but at least I do it enough. And there are just so many times that I wash other people's dishes and stuff that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2017E1\">it's just, yeah, maybe <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017F\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20180\">And I guess the other thing is, you know, say my rent is seven hundred now. Say a new place was going to be at least ten fifty for something decent. It would cost less than six hundred and fifty a month to have someone clean the house even if it was every week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20181\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20182\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20183\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20184\">CLIENT: So if we had someone sweep the floors and vacuum the couches and do that every week. And especially if I wasn't the only one paying for it. That would be less expensive than finding my own place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20185\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20186\">THERAPIST: So would that be preferable to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20187\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20188\">CLIENT: I don't know. I guess it depends on also what Aaron's plan is for Ryan's room. Because it was really irresponsible of him and really unfair of him to have both rooms be occupied and not be willing to put up a wall there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20189\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018B\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018C\">CLIENT: Because we really can't do that much more soundproofing. I really need my privacy. So, I don't know. I don't know whether or not Aaron - I don't know whether or not it would be preferable. From a money standpoint it would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2018B-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018D\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018E\">THERAPIST: Mm. But that's only one factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018F\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20190\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it seems to be the biggest factor for me. I don't know. But if I had my own place then I could have kittens and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20191\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20192\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20193\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20194\">CLIENT: Yes, I know, that would add more chores for me to feed them everyday and clean up their litter box. But they would be kittens. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20195\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20196\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20197\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20198\">CLIENT: You know, and eventually cats. And then I'd have cats around that weren't evil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20199\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019A\">THERAPIST: Potentially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019B\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019C\">CLIENT: Well 99 percent. They can't be worse then our cat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019D\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019E\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019F\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A0\">CLIENT: They can't. But, you know, because our cat is so evil no one else can have pets in the house because our cat would get really angry. And, you know, and I could use a whole space and dye things and not have to worry about, \"Oh am I taking up space with my dying.\" You know, I could do whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A01\">I wanted. So, it seems like it would be overall an improvement if I could get the right apartment and if I could make the move somehow not horrible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A1\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A2\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A3\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A4\">CLIENT: But it just seems like maybe I should wait and maybe I should save up the money. And maybe I should just get over it and deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A5\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A6\">THERAPIST: Well you seem unsure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A8\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A9\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AA\">THERAPIST: There are pros and cons on either side. But you're definitely unhappy with how things are right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AB\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AC\">CLIENT: Yeah. But maybe I should just stick it out even I am unhappy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AD\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AE\">THERAPIST: Well, I wonder if you could It sounds like the first step is finding out what other people in the house are willing to change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AF\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B0\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B1\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B2\">THERAPIST: Because it sounds like until you know that you don't know what really You're not making an informed decision. You need to know really what your options are here. Are your options living in the house exactly as it is now, minus Eliza (ph) and Aimee?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B3\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B4\">CLIENT: Which would make it no longer exactly as it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B5\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B6\">THERAPIST: But without the change in the chore responsibility and communal meals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B8\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B9\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BA\">THERAPIST: Those are the things that you have control over changing. You don't have control over changing whether or not those roommates stay or leave. They're leaving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BB\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BC\">CLIENT: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BD\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BE\">THERAPIST: But the things that you could potentially change is the communal meals and the chore responsibility. You need to be informed about whether or not, what those things are going to look like after Eliza (ph) and Aimee leave before you can really know how these two things compare. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BF\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C0\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C1\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C2\">THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like you can really compare the house versus an apartment on your own right now because definitely Eliza (ph) and Aimee are leaving, and potentially other things could change if you have a meeting and talk to the remaining housemates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C3\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C4\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah. (pause) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C5\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C6\">THERAPIST: It seems to me that you've got to take that first step so you know what you're really making a decision about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C8\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C9\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CA\">THERAPIST: Before you invest a lot of worry into determining what could potentially happen. And to know what your options are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CB\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CC\">CLIENT: Or I could just go ahead and look for a new place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CD\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CE\">THERAPIST: You could, but it seems like you're hesitant to do that because of the money and you don't know what you're leaving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CF\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D0\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D1\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D2\">THERAPIST: So if you want to do that and it doesn't matter to you what the house options could look like, then you might as well do that. But as I'm listening to you talk it sounds like you're hesitant about spending the extra money that living on your own would most likely be. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D1-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D3\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D4\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D5\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D6\">THERAPIST: I think it's very unlikely you'll find a place on your own for what you're paying now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D7\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D8\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D9\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DA\">THERAPIST: So, if that's something that you're comfortable about, why would you deny yourself the option of changing things in the house? Or the potential of that option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DB\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DC\">CLIENT: I guess you're right. It's just that it seems kind of, like I'll ask, I'm just very doubtful that things will get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DD\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DE\">THERAPIST: Ah. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DF\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E0\">CLIENT: Especially because we'll talk about it and I'm sure they'll say reasonable things and even think reasonable things. It's just whether or not they continue to, you know, if they'll do what they say. You know, like, \"Yes, I will do my own dishes after I've cooked something,\" if that's not going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E1\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E2\">THERAPIST: You don't believe it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E3\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E4\">CLIENT: Like we've said these things before and they've not worked out before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E5\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E6\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E7\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E8\">CLIENT: I don't see it actually changing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E9\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EA\">THERAPIST: So it seems like the only thing that could really change is whether or not you're having communal meals. Because if no one is cooking a communal meal then it's not going to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EB\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EC\">CLIENT: Yeah. Because it really does seem like that's the only thing I can change. Either that and\/or whether or not we'd be willing to throw some money into having people clean. And it's also maybe just because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201ED\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EE\">THERAPIST: Hm. Right. Being willing to hire someone. That seems like it could be a choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EF\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F0\">CLIENT: Yeah, because though the people we had to do the cleaning before Passover did not do a very good job. Like they didn't clean under the couches at all. Like I could barely tell that they had even come in. And it's like if I could have done a better If it's their job to be cleaners -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F1\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F2\">THERAPIST: Were other people pleased with their work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F3\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F4\">CLIENT: No. We all sort of had this, like because we were looking to do the whole finding chametz thing. And under the couch it's like, \"Oh, there is tons of chametz.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F5\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F6\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F7\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F8\">CLIENT: You know. Nothing ever happened and they didn't get the TV room at all. Or, you know, \"Look we found all these Cheerios.\" Like if they had done their job cleaning then we wouldn't have found all those Cheerios. It seems like I'm not even sure what they cleaned. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F9\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FA\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FB\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FC\">CLIENT: But it seems like they didn't really clean that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FD\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FE\">THERAPIST: That's disappointing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FF\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20200\">CLIENT: Yeah. And last year we had something similar to that where, because I guess because we shouldn't have to hovering over them and telling them to do every single little thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20201\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20202\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20203\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20204\">CLIENT: They should, you know, if we outline it for them beforehand and be like, \"We want these areas cleaned,\" I think is should be obvious that we want under the couch to be cleaned too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20205\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20206\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20207\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20208\">CLIENT: And it's not like I've always had bad experiences with people cleaning the house. You know, we used to have someone come in every other week for my house, with my parents growing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20209\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2020B\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2020C\">CLIENT: And that works fine. And maybe it's because we were starting with a higher baseline. You know, as opposed to having a cleaner come in once a year.

And, I mean, we didn't have to, like Aaron's Mom donated that as a present for Aaron.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20211\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20212\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20213\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20214\">CLIENT: To have someone come in and clean the house.

What are the suicidal thoughts?

I can't really describe it. It's like this huge amount of panic that doesn't seem to go away.

How long do you feel like they are lasting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2025B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2025C\">CLIENT: I don't know.

Does that help at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20267\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20268\">CLIENT: I don't know, because it's not like I'm doing the walking while I'm panicking. So -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20269\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026A\">THERAPIST: Mm. I wonder what would happen if when you panic, if when you start to feel panicky, if you could get yourself up and get out. If that might short circuit it a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2026B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2026C\">CLIENT: Maybe.

But, um. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20275\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20276\">THERAPIST: What can be dropped and what can't?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20277\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20278\">CLIENT: Okay. If I'm in the middle of cooking dinner, you know, and there are vegetables in the middle of sauteing or something like that. Not that it usually comes up then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20279\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027A\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027C\">CLIENT: But if it did that would be a time where I couldn't just stop. You know? Or if it happened in the middle of work, I couldn't. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027D\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2027E\">THERAPIST: Mm. You can't take a break?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2027F\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20280\">CLIENT: I guess I could take a break. Um. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20281\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20282\">THERAPIST: Sometimes panic is intensified by feeling trapped. Feeling like you can't take a break or can't get out. And I wonder if creating opportunities where maybe you actually could take a break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20283\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20284\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20285\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20286\">THERAPIST: It might help to shorten the duration. Because if you start to feel like you notice that you have some options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20287\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20288\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20289\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028A\">THERAPIST: That gives you a little bit more control. Sometimes that can take the edge off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028C\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028D\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028E\">THERAPIST: So I think there are some times when it wouldn't be safe for you to get out and walk. You know, if it's happening in the middle of the night it's probably not a safe option, or your safest option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028F\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20290\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I'd also have to put on real clothes at that point which would be harder to do when I'm panicking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20291\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20292\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. But there are things that you probably could put on hold. You know? You probably could, maybe not go walking for an hour or two hours, but if you're at work I would imagine that it's okay to, you know, stop what you're doing, take a ten minute walk, take a five minute walk. And see <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202921\">if that helps to discharge some of the energy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20293\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20294\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20295\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20296\">THERAPIST: To break up that thought pattern a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20297\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20298\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20299\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029A\">THERAPIST: You know? Even if you're cooking, sometimes you can turn the heat off of something and go walk outside for five minutes. And then come back to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029B\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029C\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029D\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029E\">THERAPIST: You know? Is that how you intended to cook dinner? No, probably not. But if it gets put on hold for five minutes, that's also probably not the end of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2029D-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029D-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099992\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2029F\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A0\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A1\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A2\">THERAPIST: So letting yourself see where there might be an option to do something that could help you, that might not stop it but might shorten their duration or take the intensity off of it to put you back in control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A3\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A4\">CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause) Okay. I'm going to try it. It's just also hard to, when I'm in the middle of panicking be like, \"Oh, I should go for a walk.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202A5\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202A6\">THERAPIST: It is hard.

It's going to feel forced because it's different than what you're used to doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B3\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B4\">CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B5\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B6\">THERAPIST: Dying doesn't have to be your only way out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B7\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B8\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B9\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BA\">THERAPIST: Waiting it out has worked every time. It's sometimes really hard to wait and sometimes really long, but waiting it out does work because it always ends at some point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BB\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BC\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202BD\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202BE\">THERAPIST: This might be another thing.

Yeah. I will try it if I can remember to try it. Which I can make no guarantees of remembering to try it, because it might get to the point where I just don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C5\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C6\">THERAPIST: Mm. You can also write your options down some place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C7\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C8\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C9\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CA\">THERAPIST: So that it becomes something to kind of help jog your memory. Next time I panic I can try one, two, three. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CB\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CC\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CD\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CE\">THERAPIST: Taking a walk. Talking to somebody. Waiting it out. You can put that down for yourself so that when you're panicking and looking for something to help you can have your own prescription.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CF\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D0\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D1\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D2\">THERAPIST: I know it's hard to think when you're panicking. It's hard to think logically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D3\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D4\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think (inaudible at 00:44:13) it really depends on what I'm panicking about and how severe it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D5\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D6\">THERAPIST: Well hopefully this is a down swing. You said it's better than last week and hopefully it will continue to get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D7\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D8\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D9\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DA\">THERAPIST: And get to a place where you feel like you can make use of some of the tools you have to manage it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DB\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DC\">CLIENT: I was even able to get to work on Thursday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DD\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DE\">THERAPIST: That's great because I know you weren't sure you were going to be able to, but you did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DF\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E0\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I ended up doing a little bit of (inaudible at 00:44:41). I got late partially because I got a late start and partially because (sigh) since I didn't make coffee I was like, okay, it's Passover. I don't think getting coffee at a Dunkin Donuts when there is like all the donuts and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E1\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E2\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E3\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E4\">CLIENT: I don't really think that's within the way I observe Passover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E5\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E6\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E7\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E8\">CLIENT: So I had nothing caffeinated really. So I ended up having to pull over at an exit in a parking lot and take a ten minute doze.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E9\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EA\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EB\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EC\">CLIENT: Because I was falling asleep at the wheel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202ED\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EE\">THERAPIST: Mm.
