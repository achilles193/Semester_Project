Sounds like it\u2019s really been rough for you guys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I feel like I keep on being a jerk and the fights still come up in my face. And I thought we had made progress on\u2026 it was either Friday or Saturday night where\u2026 because one of the problems is that if I bring up anything\u2026 even if he\u2019s in an okay mood ahead of time, as soon as I bring up something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">our lack of sex life, he immediately starts being really upset, and then he can\u2019t discuss things rationally when he\u2019s upset. We tried a work around, which was to stop talking about it and cuddle and get him to calm down. [1:10] And then we were able to talk a little bit. But after some point he wasn\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: If it\u2019s something important to talk about because that\u2019s been an area where you have been very frustrated for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he keeps on saying he\u2019ll work out and he\u2019s working on it, but I see no evidence of that and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So it doesn\u2019t feel like anything\u2019s changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, like nothing changes. And I\u2019ve tried\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to break up with him. I don\u2019t know how to get my sex life back. [crying] We discussed the possibility of maybe me seeing\u2026 going to other people for sexual things so that way he doesn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t have to bother him about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Is that what it feels like to him? Sex feels like a bother? Or any intimacy? What is he comfortable with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: He\u2019s comfortable with cuddling, but only for a little while because then he gets uncomfortable. Not emotionally, but physically. And I guess it\u2019s just hard because I guess in previous relationships he\u2019s had a twin bed and so then you\u2019re like automatically closer so\u2026 well it\u2019s like if you\u2026 he\u2019ll\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">if your head is between the\u2026 my pillow and your pillow you can move your pillow over. This should not be something that\u2019s insurmountable but that\u2019s it. Maybe a little bit of kissing but not even making out, just a couple of kisses or something. [2:45] That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all he feels comfortable with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Do you understand what is his discomfort? Is it that he does not feel any sexual urges? Is it something that he\u2019s uncomfortable with the idea of sex?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: It\u2019s every time it comes up, he panics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s the panic? What\u2019s he afraid of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Do you understand that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t understand that. It happens every single time, sometimes even when he\u2019s into it. Yeah, so it\u2019s not that he has no sexual urges, it\u2019s that any sort of action induces panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s almost like he has a phobia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: And when he says it\u2019ll work out, he\u2019s working on it, do you know what that\u2026 what does he\u2019s working on it mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean I guess he sometimes brings it up in therapy. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: But he\u2019s not seeing a specific sex therapist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, he isn\u2019t. [3:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Is that something he\u2019d be open to? It\u2019s a pretty unique specialty and that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something he\u2019d be open to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Is that something that would\u2026 when you\u2026 I mean you mentioned kind of breaking up. Would some\u2026 that changing or him specifically addressing that, is that something that you feel like you need in order to stay in the relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: I think so. I mean right now I think a lot of me staying is inertia, feeling like I can\u2019t do everything on my own and being afraid of being alone. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: So being afraid of being alone is not a great reason to be with somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: No, it isn\u2019t. [4:36] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s scary, though, to think about such a big change. You\u2019ve been together for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t want to give up after I\u2019ve been waiting and waiting and waiting, trying to be as patient as possible. [crying] And it just also\u2026 I\u2019m starting to think that okay, maybe if you get out, the relationship will instantly get better and he\u2019ll be fine having sex with someone else is<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That would be really hurtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve given up two years of having no sex life to stay with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s no guarantee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I mean what kind of work\u2026 what would going to a sex therapist be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well I\u2019m not a sex therapist so I don\u2019t know exactly what the treatment plan would be. One of the reasons that I ask about it is because if that was specifically an issue that somebody were struggling with and coming to see me, I don\u2019t think that I... I don\u2019t feel competent to treat that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">So I\u2019m not sure the position that his current therapist is in because it\u2019s not\u2026 that\u2019s not the specialty, from what I understand, with his current therapist. It wasn\u2019t the original reason he sought therapy. So there actually is an Institute for Sexual Intimacy in\u2026 it\u2019s either New Haven or Wallingford, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200552\">somewhere close, and Doctor Kyra Johnson is the person that runs that agency. And she\u2019s pretty well known. But that whole practice is geared towards people who have various issues with sexual intimacy, whether it be recovering from physiological trauma or more emotional issues like sex phobia or pain <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200553\">upon intercourse or inability to have intercourse for either emotional or physical reasons. [6:36] So I don\u2019t know exactly what the treatment would look like but what I do know is that I\u2019m not experienced enough in that field to adequately treat somebody who\u2019s struggling with that particular issue. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200554\">And I\u2026 what I would do if that was a main issue of therapy is certainly refer to someone who does have that specialty. And I can certainly provide you with information. I don\u2019t\u2026 this isn\u2019t your issue; this is Sydney\u2019 issue. And obviously it has significant impact on you. And expecting and wanting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200555\">have a satisfying sexual relationship with your boyfriend is perfectly appropriate. That\u2019s something that you need in a relationship. It\u2019s okay for you to need that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: [crying] And yeah, I don\u2019t know. I mean I think it comes up in therapy but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever\u2026 it doesn\u2019t really get addressed head on or I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing anything specific about it. And just if I do end up by myself I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to find anyone else. I\u2019ve gained all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">this weight and I\u2019m depressed and I can\u2019t have vaginal intercourse, so I thought who would want to date me. I\u2019m just never going to have a satisfying sex life. I don\u2019t even think I could find someone to\u2026 if Sydney was okay with me going and seeing someone else while still dating him, I don\u2019t think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">would ever happen either at this point because I\u2019m just so fat and ugly. [8:35] No one would want me like this. I don\u2019t know why Sydney still thinks I\u2019m attractive. And I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d be the only one that thinks that. He says that. If he met me the way I\u2019m looking now without knowing my personality <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200573\">he would\u2019ve asked me out, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s really actually true.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t you believe him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m fat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And that means you\u2019re not attractive to anybody? [9:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s necessarily the case. It certainly doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s the case to Sydney. You\u2019ve gained weight but he doesn\u2019t feel that you\u2019re unattractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like other guys ever hit on me or anything. Even when I was thin it didn\u2019t really happen and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s two separate issues, right. So whether I think staying with Sydney because you\u2019re afraid you won\u2019t find somebody else is not a good reason to stay with Sydney. I can understand your fears of being alone, but not wanting to be alone does not mean you stay with someone that you\u2019re unhappy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">with. So I think what you need to determine is do you want to be with Sydney. If you do, that\u2019s okay. And you have to find ways for you to feel comfortable and satisfied in your relationship. If you don\u2019t want to be with him anymore, then you need to break up with him and we confront the next piece, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">which is your fear of being alone and not finding somebody, as a separate issue. But staying with somebody because you\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re not going to find somebody else doesn\u2019t lead to a happy relationship with that person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. [10:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I want to be happy with him. I do. It\u2019s really hard to get past the fact that we have no sex life and then we fight and it\u2019s usually my fault that we fight and he doesn\u2019t\u2026 he says he\u2019ll do something in a second and then he ignores it and continues to not do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s your fault?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: No, but me bringing it up is my fault, and getting annoyed at it and telling him that I\u2019m annoyed at him and getting annoyed at him is my fault. And but all the trash and recycling in the house has just piled up and I can\u2019t conquer it by myself. And he says that he\u2019d help me and he never does and [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s a really uncomfortable situation to live in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get out of this mess by myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mess, what\u2019s the mess?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Well the boxes for takeout and stuff, and the trash, which is probably too heavy to\u2026 the fact that there are things that are too high for me to reach and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Makes you feel really dependent upon somebody that\u2019s not dependable. It\u2019s a precarious situation to be in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to move back in with my parents but maybe I should. [crying]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: How would things be different if you were on your own?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: I mean I\u2019d probably make myself do the dishes more and eat takeout less because I couldn\u2019t afford it. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d do groceries without a car because otherwise I\u2019d have to carry heavy things back. And it would mean having to go to the grocery store more often, and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">know if I\u2019m going to be able to be that responsible, or if I\u2019m too depressed for that. And just the way the apartment is set up, it\u2019s not good for someone my height. [13:07] Which I should have thought about more when I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You were looking at other requirements so it may be hard to see details like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just a problem. Everything is not good for people my height. They don\u2019t build apartments for people my height. And I feel so boxed in and trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: So let\u2019s think about ways you can overcome some of the hurdles. Are there accommodations you can make, stepstools, things that help you extend your reach? Do you have any of those kinds of tools?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Well I have a stepstool. The problem is, the\u2026 even the... so there are these four shelves that are above the sink. But first of all you have the sink coming out so you\u2019re already further away from it, and then I can reach the first shelf and that\u2019s it. And I have a three step step stool and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">I think that will get me up to the second shelf, possibly the third, but it\u2019s really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: And you have things stored on there that you need access to, out of reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: The second shelf has the Tupperwares for me to put in leftovers, so I need that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And do you have one of those grabber thingys?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: No but I don\u2019t\u2026 they\u2019re hard to operate. I\u2019ve used them before. They\u2019re not very good at actually\u2026 it\u2019s like one of those claws in the machine with toys and stuff like that. It feels like that. [14:50] And definitely not anything delicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: No, but Tupperware, I was thinking, might\u2026 depending on what you put on those shelves, something like a Tupperware that\u2019s light and if it drops won\u2019t break. So I mean there\u2019s little\u2026 there\u2019s situational problems like this that we might be able to find workarounds for. But the bigger thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">is really if you are afraid of being independent, how much you trust yourself to take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: [crying] I really wish I could move back into the house and\u2026 or\u2026 I can\u2019t.

And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily get them as soon as I wanted them but somebody with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">a car or a big bicycle would\u2026 big bags would do the grocery shopping and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: So what about a delivery service? If what you want to do is pay money and circle items\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019ll cost too much.

There are some losses that you can\u2019t do much about, people <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D3\">that move to Colorado or Florida or live really far away.

Yeah, I mean it\u2019s not as convenient as the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D4\">same neighborhood or same house, but reality is that most people don\u2019t live with all of their friends in the same neighborhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: I mean the other thing is that most of my friends are employed and so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so the schedules\u2026 their schedule is more limited, but you have nights and weekends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: I know.

If you\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201651\">safe at home with your meds, then either you can\u2019t be at home or they can\u2019t be there in that amount.

This\u2026 your psychiatrist\u2019s job and my job is to make sure that you are safe, that we\u2019re providing safe treatment, and if that\u2019s not possible in an outpatient setting then to get you into an inpatient setting. Your job <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201751\">is to follow through in your treatment recommendations that both she and I make. So if it\u2019s not safe for you to have more than five days\u2019 worth of meds at home then it\u2019s important for your psychiatrist to know that and to prescribe accordingly. If you can\u2019t follow through on it, that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not her <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201752\">responsibility to make sure that you pick up your meds. It is part of her responsibility to make sure that she\u2019s not prescribing medication to you in ways that\u2019s dangerous. [38:11] Obviously you need those meds. So you either have to get\u2026 be safe with them yourself or be in a place that\u2019s going to monitor <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201753\">for you and not give you access to more than what you need at a time. When you report that you\u2019re suicidal it\u2019s important for me to know exactly what that means. If you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re suicidal but you don\u2019t actually really think that you\u2019re going to do it, then maybe we need to change the language <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201754\">of what you\u2019re saying so that it\u2019s more accurate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s really accurate. I get that you\u2019re miserable. I mean I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re really saying, is that you\u2019re miserable. Am I getting it? Do I understand you? I want to understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: I think so. I\u2019m just so miserable. [crying] Nothing seems worth it. I hate myself so much.

Am I taking care of myself? I want to continue to support you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD3\">being as adult and capable as possible, which is why if I felt like you needed to be in a hospital I would ask you to call. I would ask you to be the adult. I\u2019m not a parent.

I believe in the inherent value of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CF\">CLIENT: But what if I never\u2026 like if they\u2019re not really treating me or anything\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D1\">THERAPIST: They would be treating you. [48:38] You would be getting your meds, you\u2019d be getting therapies, and it would be more intense. When you\u2019re in the hospital you\u2019ll get their\u2026 you have a session every day. And there\u2019s also other\u2026 I mean there\u2019s levels of care in between inpatient unit and outpatient <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D11\">therapy. So the level in between would be intensive outpatient, a day program, where you\u2019d be doing group and individual therapy in a daily way. So what we know is therapy works for depression and anxiety. Your\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D3\">CLIENT: Then why am I not getting any better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D5\">THERAPIST: You certainly have had points where you\u2019re better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D7\">CLIENT: But not recently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Well, last week you\u2026 if you listen to the recording from last week you were at a different place then than you are today. So\u2026 and one of the things about feeling very depressed is that it\u2019s often very hard to remember what things were like three days ago if you\u2019re feeling really bad today. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D91\">And you project it forward. You\u2019re imagining that you\u2019re going to feel the exact same way forever that you are right now. Sitting over here, I know that\u2019s not true because I\u2019ve seen you have ups and downs. Being in a down does not mean that there will never be an up. It\u2019s hard to trust that right now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D92\">It\u2019s much easier for me to say, but if you can step back and think about other weeks, other days, they\u2019re not all the same. [50:13] Now we can stop there for today. If there\u2019s a time where you don\u2019t feel safe you call me, or you immediately call the ER.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">THERAPIST: And I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">CLIENT: Are we scheduled for [inaudible] I know we\u2019re on schedule [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re not scheduled next week because you\u2019re going to be away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, should we do a phone session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E5\">THERAPIST: We certainly can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">CLIENT: If you have time or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">THERAPIST: I can do one on Tuesday.

And I thought we had made progress on\u2026 it was either Friday or Saturday night where\u2026 because one of the problems is that if I bring up anything\u2026 even if he\u2019s in an okay mood ahead of time, as soon as I bring up something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">our lack of sex life, he immediately starts being really upset, and then he can\u2019t discuss things rationally when he\u2019s upset. We tried a work around, which was to stop talking about it and cuddle and get him to calm down. [1:10] And then we were able to talk a little bit.

What is he comfortable with?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: He\u2019s comfortable with cuddling, but only for a little while because then he gets uncomfortable. Not emotionally, but physically. And I guess it\u2019s just hard because I guess in previous relationships he\u2019s had a twin bed and so then you\u2019re like automatically closer so\u2026 well it\u2019s like if you\u2026 he\u2019ll\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">if your head is between the\u2026 my pillow and your pillow you can move your pillow over. This should not be something that\u2019s insurmountable but that\u2019s it. Maybe a little bit of kissing but not even making out, just a couple of kisses or something. [2:45] That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all he feels comfortable with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Do you understand what is his discomfort?

It happens every single time, sometimes even when he\u2019s into it. Yeah, so it\u2019s not that he has no sexual urges, it\u2019s that any sort of action induces panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s almost like he has a phobia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: And when he says it\u2019ll work out, he\u2019s working on it, do you know what that\u2026 what does he\u2019s working on it mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I mean I guess he sometimes brings it up in therapy. But\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: But he\u2019s not seeing a specific sex therapist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: No, he isn\u2019t.

And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: So being afraid of being alone is not a great reason to be with somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: No, it isn\u2019t.

[crying] And it just also\u2026 I\u2019m starting to think that okay, maybe if you get out, the relationship will instantly get better and he\u2019ll be fine having sex with someone else is<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That would be really hurtful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve given up two years of having no sex life to stay with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s no guarantee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I mean what kind of work\u2026 what would going to a sex therapist be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well I\u2019m not a sex therapist so I don\u2019t know exactly what the treatment plan would be. One of the reasons that I ask about it is because if that was specifically an issue that somebody were struggling with and coming to see me, I don\u2019t think that I... I don\u2019t feel competent to treat that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200551\">So I\u2019m not sure the position that his current therapist is in because it\u2019s not\u2026 that\u2019s not the specialty, from what I understand, with his current therapist. It wasn\u2019t the original reason he sought therapy. So there actually is an Institute for Sexual Intimacy in\u2026 it\u2019s either New Haven or Wallingford, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200552\">somewhere close, and Doctor Kyra Johnson is the person that runs that agency. And she\u2019s pretty well known. But that whole practice is geared towards people who have various issues with sexual intimacy, whether it be recovering from physiological trauma or more emotional issues like sex phobia or pain <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200553\">upon intercourse or inability to have intercourse for either emotional or physical reasons. [6:36] So I don\u2019t know exactly what the treatment would look like but what I do know is that I\u2019m not experienced enough in that field to adequately treat somebody who\u2019s struggling with that particular issue. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200554\">And I\u2026 what I would do if that was a main issue of therapy is certainly refer to someone who does have that specialty. And I can certainly provide you with information. I don\u2019t\u2026 this isn\u2019t your issue; this is Sydney\u2019 issue. And obviously it has significant impact on you. And expecting and wanting to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200555\">have a satisfying sexual relationship with your boyfriend is perfectly appropriate. That\u2019s something that you need in a relationship. It\u2019s okay for you to need that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: [crying] And yeah, I don\u2019t know. I mean I think it comes up in therapy but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever\u2026 it doesn\u2019t really get addressed head on or I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing anything specific about it. And just if I do end up by myself I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to find anyone else. I\u2019ve gained all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">this weight and I\u2019m depressed and I can\u2019t have vaginal intercourse, so I thought who would want to date me. I\u2019m just never going to have a satisfying sex life. I don\u2019t even think I could find someone to\u2026 if Sydney was okay with me going and seeing someone else while still dating him, I don\u2019t think that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200572\">would ever happen either at this point because I\u2019m just so fat and ugly. [8:35] No one would want me like this. I don\u2019t know why Sydney still thinks I\u2019m attractive. And I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d be the only one that thinks that. He says that. If he met me the way I\u2019m looking now without knowing my personality <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200573\">he would\u2019ve asked me out, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s really actually true.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t you believe him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m fat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And that means you\u2019re not attractive to anybody?

It certainly doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s the case to Sydney. You\u2019ve gained weight but he doesn\u2019t feel that you\u2019re unattractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like other guys ever hit on me or anything. Even when I was thin it didn\u2019t really happen and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s two separate issues, right. So whether I think staying with Sydney because you\u2019re afraid you won\u2019t find somebody else is not a good reason to stay with Sydney. I can understand your fears of being alone, but not wanting to be alone does not mean you stay with someone that you\u2019re unhappy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">with. So I think what you need to determine is do you want to be with Sydney. If you do, that\u2019s okay. And you have to find ways for you to feel comfortable and satisfied in your relationship. If you don\u2019t want to be with him anymore, then you need to break up with him and we confront the next piece, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200652\">which is your fear of being alone and not finding somebody, as a separate issue. But staying with somebody because you\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re not going to find somebody else doesn\u2019t lead to a happy relationship with that person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know.

It\u2019s really hard to get past the fact that we have no sex life and then we fight and it\u2019s usually my fault that we fight and he doesn\u2019t\u2026 he says he\u2019ll do something in a second and then he ignores it and continues to not do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s your fault?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: No, but me bringing it up is my fault, and getting annoyed at it and telling him that I\u2019m annoyed at him and getting annoyed at him is my fault. And but all the trash and recycling in the house has just piled up and I can\u2019t conquer it by myself. And he says that he\u2019d help me and he never does and [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s a really uncomfortable situation to live in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get out of this mess by myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mess, what\u2019s the mess?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Well the boxes for takeout and stuff, and the trash, which is probably too heavy to\u2026 the fact that there are things that are too high for me to reach and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Makes you feel really dependent upon somebody that\u2019s not dependable. It\u2019s a precarious situation to be in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t want to move back in with my parents but maybe I should.

I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d do groceries without a car because otherwise I\u2019d have to carry heavy things back. And it would mean having to go to the grocery store more often, and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">know if I\u2019m going to be able to be that responsible, or if I\u2019m too depressed for that. And just the way the apartment is set up, it\u2019s not good for someone my height. [13:07] Which I should have thought about more when I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You were looking at other requirements so it may be hard to see details like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just a problem.

Are there accommodations you can make, stepstools, things that help you extend your reach? Do you have any of those kinds of tools?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Well I have a stepstool. The problem is, the\u2026 even the... so there are these four shelves that are above the sink. But first of all you have the sink coming out so you\u2019re already further away from it, and then I can reach the first shelf and that\u2019s it. And I have a three step step stool and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">I think that will get me up to the second shelf, possibly the third, but it\u2019s really\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: And you have things stored on there that you need access to, out of reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: The second shelf has the Tupperwares for me to put in leftovers, so I need that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And do you have one of those grabber thingys?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: No but I don\u2019t\u2026 they\u2019re hard to operate. I\u2019ve used them before. They\u2019re not very good at actually\u2026 it\u2019s like one of those claws in the machine with toys and stuff like that. It feels like that. [14:50] And definitely not anything delicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: No, but Tupperware, I was thinking, might\u2026 depending on what you put on those shelves, something like a Tupperware that\u2019s light and if it drops won\u2019t break. So I mean there\u2019s little\u2026 there\u2019s situational problems like this that we might be able to find workarounds for. But the bigger thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">is really if you are afraid of being independent, how much you trust yourself to take care of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: [crying] I really wish I could move back into the house and\u2026 or\u2026 I can\u2019t.

And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily get them as soon as I wanted them but somebody with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">a car or a big bicycle would\u2026 big bags would do the grocery shopping and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: So what about a delivery service? If what you want to do is pay money and circle items\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019ll cost too much.

So if it\u2019s not safe for you to have more than five days\u2019 worth of meds at home then it\u2019s important for your psychiatrist to know that and to prescribe accordingly. If you can\u2019t follow through on it, that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not her <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201752\">responsibility to make sure that you pick up your meds. It is part of her responsibility to make sure that she\u2019s not prescribing medication to you in ways that\u2019s dangerous. [38:11] Obviously you need those meds.

When you report that you\u2019re suicidal it\u2019s important for me to know exactly what that means.

That\u2019s the only reason why they needed me and not the cat sitter. If they hadn\u2019t been fostering the kittens then they wouldn\u2019t have needed me at all.

I think their house probably would\u2019ve been fine on its own for two weeks. [43:03] (pause) I mean compared to the amount of money that I\u2019m spending on rent and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201A71\">stuff like that, it\u2019s nothing in comparison. And I just make people miserable all the time like I\u2019m making Sydney miserable.

I\u2019m sure Sydney feels sad for you and clearly you guys are having a lot of problems in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B11\">relationship because you\u2019re both dealing with so much sadness. Seem to be reinforcing each other\u2019s unhappiness in some ways while at other times you guys bring each other happiness. It seems that the past couple of days have been especially hard.

You do have the responsibility of caring for the cats, which seems important to you. And you\u2019ve also said that while you\u2019ve in the past couple <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B91\">of weeks maybe stood there and held the bottles and thought about taking the pills, you haven\u2019t actually ever taken off the cap and taken more than you\u2019re supposed to. So I feel secure that you\u2019re not in imminent risk of harming yourself. It\u2019s my job to continue to assess it every time you say it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B92\">I will. I do have permission to talk with your psychiatrist. You signed a release. I trust that you\u2019re honest with her, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BB\">CLIENT: I just haven\u2019t been this bad since I\u2019ve had the appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Right, so I know you don\u2019t see her as often, which is why when you come in every week and express this much distress that I ask questions, because I know I\u2019m the person who sees you the most. So I see you\u2026 the intricacies with the ups and downs. I know that today is clearly a down place but <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD1\">it\u2019s not where you are all the time. And I take that into account when I think about whether or not I need to ask you whether or not you feel like you need to be in a higher level of care at a hospital. [46:33] I would never call anybody without you knowing. If at the end of a session I feel like you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD2\">not going to be safe until the next session, I would ask you to call the ER. But I want you to be in control as much as possible. You need to be honest with yourself, and that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re struggling with, is am I a capable adult? Am I taking care of myself? I want to continue to support you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD3\">being as adult and capable as possible, which is why if I felt like you needed to be in a hospital I would ask you to call. I would ask you to be the adult. I\u2019m not a parent. Yes, I\u2026 it\u2019s my\u2026 it is my job to assess your safety but I hand the responsibility to you as much as possible to keep yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201BD4\">safe because you\u2019re a grown up and you are competent. If you feel like that\u2019s too much responsibility then we can talk about that. But does that feel like too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201BF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Because if it does you let me know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">THERAPIST: And that would be a sign that you need to be in a hospital. If you can\u2019t make\u2026 if you can\u2019t do those basic things then together we need to decide that a hospital is the place for you and not outpatient care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how being in a hospital would help if it just made me even more\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C9\">THERAPIST: It just keeps you safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s basically just okay, [sp?] looking at down the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CD\">THERAPIST: It keeps you safe until such time you can do so yourself. I believe in the inherent value of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CF\">CLIENT: But what if I never\u2026 like if they\u2019re not really treating me or anything\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D1\">THERAPIST: They would be treating you. [48:38] You would be getting your meds, you\u2019d be getting therapies, and it would be more intense. When you\u2019re in the hospital you\u2019ll get their\u2026 you have a session every day. And there\u2019s also other\u2026 I mean there\u2019s levels of care in between inpatient unit and outpatient <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D11\">therapy. So the level in between would be intensive outpatient, a day program, where you\u2019d be doing group and individual therapy in a daily way. So what we know is therapy works for depression and anxiety. Your\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D3\">CLIENT: Then why am I not getting any better?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D5\">THERAPIST: You certainly have had points where you\u2019re better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D7\">CLIENT: But not recently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">THERAPIST: Well, last week you\u2026 if you listen to the recording from last week you were at a different place then than you are today. So\u2026 and one of the things about feeling very depressed is that it\u2019s often very hard to remember what things were like three days ago if you\u2019re feeling really bad today. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D91\">And you project it forward. You\u2019re imagining that you\u2019re going to feel the exact same way forever that you are right now. Sitting over here, I know that\u2019s not true because I\u2019ve seen you have ups and downs. Being in a down does not mean that there will never be an up. It\u2019s hard to trust that right now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201D92\">It\u2019s much easier for me to say, but if you can step back and think about other weeks, other days, they\u2019re not all the same. [50:13] Now we can stop there for today. If there\u2019s a time where you don\u2019t feel safe you call me, or you immediately call the ER.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561897\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">THERAPIST: And I think\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">CLIENT: Are we scheduled for [inaudible] I know we\u2019re on schedule [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re not scheduled next week because you\u2019re going to be away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah, should we do a phone session?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E5\">THERAPIST: We certainly can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">CLIENT: If you have time or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">THERAPIST: I can do one on Tuesday.
