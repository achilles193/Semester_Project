I did end up going and applying at the store, though I didn\u2019t have my resume printed out. So I just did the application, and, like, it wasn\u2019t as ready as if I had a few process and stuff (ph). I didn\u2019t want to undersell myself, and they said they have competitive pay. But I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">not sure what competitive pay for retail is. So, I think I requested an amount I should have just written negotiable, but obviously I wasn\u2019t thinking straight when I filled it. I mean, if I don\u2019t get it, I don\u2019t get it. But at least I did it. And then I applied for the job that I was telling you about. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">There was also this part time job in a local middle school. It was posted on the listserv. So, it has both current grad students and people who stayed on the list afterwards. I did the application anyways, but made it be just the same e-mail. It was Friday after business hours, so I didn\u2019t know when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">she\u2019d get back to me. So I was just like, you know, I don\u2019t know if this is open to non-students. If it is, here\u2019s my application stuff. She wrote me back this morning thanking me, so I guess if it wasn\u2019t open to non-students, she would have said something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Well, good for you. You took three really solid steps. How did it feel to ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: It felt, well, I guess, applying to the retail place I have all the second guessing myself afterwards. But the other stuff felt really good to get out. Tara has a friend who works there, who I actually met a couple of years ago, and she showed me around the zoo. I sent her an e-mail letting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">her know I applied, but she never wrote me back. So I\u2019m hoping I didn\u2019t write anything offensive or anything. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so I basically told her that, you know, I wasn\u2019t sure if she remembered me, but I really enjoyed when she had given me the tour, and I thought it was a really nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">place to work. This position opened, and I thought it would be good. I applied through the normal channels, but here\u2019s my resume. Let me know if you think it would be a good fit. And she never wrote me back, so I don\u2019t know if she just I hope it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a terrible fit for the position. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It certainly doesn\u2019t sound offensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Oh, good. I guess not offensive so much as I was asking too much, and being too pushy. But that\u2019s the problem with networking. It always feels that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: It is, networking. Not pushy, but it\u2019s okay to ask for what you want. Pushy is demanding what you want, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I guess I feels like I\u2019m asking for a lot for someone who\u2019s never worked for me. You know, if it was like Tara working there, I\u2019d be like, hey, Tara, I\u2019m going to apply here, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a closer connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, whereas it\u2019s, like, a friend of Tara\u2019s. I think Tara has only told her good things about me because she really liked me, but still. This person has never worked with me, so all they have to go on is their friend\u2019s words and my resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not as strong of a connection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: (pause) I haven\u2019t actually searched the sites recently, so there might be more things to apply to. The stuff I found on our cascade (ph) was -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: When was the last time you looked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: This morning. They had posted something, which is all the way at the other end of Vermont. And I\u2019m like, hell no, that\u2019s a two hour drive each way. Hell no. I wasn\u2019t sure how far away Stockbridge was until I looked it up. Because I had been there before, but only coming from Connecticut. But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">yeah, the other stuff. There was the one I had applied for, and the other stuff looked like it was from too long ago, that I should probably look at more current things and apply for those instead. I feel like if a job was posted April 1st, it\u2019s probably too late at this point to apply. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Do they take stuff down after it\u2019s been filled?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if they do. Like, they\u2019re not really a natural job site. They\u2019re a blog that posts. I guess I could click on the links, which I didn\u2019t bother doing, and I could see. I guess the link would show whether or not the position is still open. Though I feel like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: If there\u2019s something that\u2019s a really good fit, maybe it\u2019s worth -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s worth it, it\u2019s worth it. Yeah. Oh yeah, there was one at the R.I. Public Zoo and I (shudders), I hate the R.I. Public Zoo so much. It\u2019s, like, the worst policy. I guess I could see how it could be an economic opportunity thing, like if you have people who are less affluent who live in actual <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">R.I., and if you assume that the people who are more affluent or living in New Haven, then I could see it being an equalizer, and that\u2019s why it would only be open to R.I. residents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s also lots of sections, right. I think people living in nearby, are (chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. They\u2019re probably a lot better off than I am. It actually makes no sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s been limiting for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even look at the postings anymore. Because if I look, I see how I might be a really good fit, and it\u2019ll just make me sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(pause) I\u2019m definitely not going to make the June deadline of getting a job in time for me to renew the lease. But I\u2019m hoping that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Have you talked to your parents? If you had an offer in hand but hadn\u2019t started?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I think if I had an offer in hand, they\u2019d be fine with it. I haven\u2019t talked to them, but, like, I\u2019m not going to get an offer in hand in the next month (pause). Like, the one at the middle school is only 15 hours a week, so I don\u2019t know how much it pays. It still might be worth it for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">take it, but it might not be enough to pay for my own place. I guess I could supplement it with the NOKIA (ph) job if I get that, too, and then maybe it would be enough. But, like, I don\u2019t know if I get an interview, if that interview would be before the end of May. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they would have to move on a fast timeline to get a response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: And I feel like a lot of things don\u2019t move on a fast timeline. (pause) Yeah, I\u2019ll probably have to do the whole apartment search again thing, and I\u2019m really hoping I don\u2019t have to move back with my parents. Because I\u2019d really like something full time. The one at the Schlesinger is actually full-time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">and permanent. I don\u2019t know if I should start looking for part-time stuff in Connecticut instead. But then that would just make me more stuck there, I think. It would be nice to be making money while I\u2019m there. If I\u2019m there. Which I\u2019m really hoping that I won\u2019t be there. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(pause) Yeah, I need to look at more things. I\u2019m just afraid that maybe I\u2019ve already missed the season of all the stuff being posted, and all the academic positions, and I just screwed myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t go back, you can\u2019t go back in time. You can\u2019t let your fear of that stop you from looking at what\u2019s available now, and following through on things. Even if that means clicking on older links and seeing if they\u2019re still open. If you\u2019re afraid that you\u2019ve missed things, then you need <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">to be more diligent about catching, rather than avoiding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I feel like the later, unless it\u2019s a really good fit, the later you go, they\u2019ve seen a lot of candidates. If they\u2019re going to consider you later, the bar is set much higher for later candidates. Because you have to be better than all the candidates they\u2019ve already seen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: So are you telling me why you can\u2019t look at things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I can look at them. I\u2019m telling you why it might be a waste of time to apply to them. I mean, I guess I can start with the ones that are newer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You have plenty of time. When you were working and trying to look for a job, then your time was limited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: A waste of my emotional energy. Which is more limited than my time is. I guess I do have all the time now, especially now that the Takeo concert is over now, so I don\u2019t have anything going on on Sundays or Tuesdays. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: So if it\u2019s the emotional energy that feels limiting, how can we make it so that it requires less energy to pursue these? Because the only way to get a job is to apply to jobs, and sometimes lots of them. And so, I think we need to find ways to make it a little bit less taxing. To make it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">less anxiety-producing. So that you can really apply to everything that would be an option. It doesn\u2019t make sense to expend energy applying to things that are not really options. But if something is interesting, and in your field, and open, then it\u2019s an option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know, I mean, maybe if I reward myself enough, that would be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: How did you get yourself to do the applications that you ticked off when you came in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: So the alumni, this was mid-March, they started an e-mail being like, hey, are people interested in fitness? And I\u2019m like, oh, I totally need to lose all the weight, and stuff. Then there was like, oh, there\u2019s this thing online okay, are you familiar with RPGs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Okay, RPGs are role playing games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, I know what that is. I just didn\u2019t know the abbreviation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Okay, so you know how you have a character and it levels up, and you have a party and stuff? So there\u2019s this thing called Have It RPG, where you can create a party with your real-life friends, and the way you level up is by doing tasks. And those tasks are things you enter yourself. You can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">mark them as easy, medium, hard. You can have daily things that you need to do, and will hurt the party if you don\u2019t do them. And so, I have things like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: You feel really accountable to the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, and then I can get things like, go to grocery store, or send this application.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: So you used that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: So I used that, which got me those two. Of course, I\u2019m still afraid to set, even as a daily or weekly exercise, because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: What do you count? Do you count going dancing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do. I didn\u2019t want to do it this week because I didn\u2019t go to swing dancing because of my rehearsals. I guess I could start doing that, and then maybe that\u2019ll force me. It\u2019s pretty easy for me to get to swing dancing, but it\u2019s a lot harder for me to get to country dancing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: But you could just have it be dancing, and then if you get to one or the other, you get to check it off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I could do that, but then I\u2019m only dancing once a week. It\u2019s not really helping. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Except that is the bare minimum. Because you\u2019re always allowed to do extra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, but what I\u2019m setting, the bare minimum is what I\u2019m already doing. And that\u2019s already what I\u2019m doing anyways, so it\u2019s already there. It\u2019s more whether or not I should start stretching my goals. You know, do I want to make myself go on a 20-minute walk every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: So, when you\u2019re setting a goal, you want it to be a little higher than what you\u2019re doing, but totally reachable. Because you can always increase your goal, right? So, what would be that? What would be one little increment more than what you\u2019re already doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Maybe if I, like (pause)...because the way it\u2019s set up, you have things that are dailies, and you can mark them as certain days of the week. But that sort of commits you to doing certain days of the week, so it\u2019s a little bit harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: So you can\u2019t set something up as a once a week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, you can set something up as a once a week, but it\u2019s a once a week on a specific day. So I can\u2019t be like, okay, I want to walk 20 minutes a day, at least three days a week. I guess I can set them up as specific days, and if I\u2019ve done them high that day <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: So if you set it on Tuesday\/Thursday, maybe if you walk on Monday\/Tuesday, you could give yourself a click on a Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Exactly. I guess I could do that. (pause) Yeah, I feel like adding 20 minute walks would probably be helpful. I did a lot of walking yesterday, but, yeah, it\u2019s still not something I\u2019m doing regular, it\u2019s still like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Is there a place you typically walk to? Like is there an errand you can do by foot? Or is there a place you can go for coffee? Can you build it into something that would be sort of in the schedule already? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: If I\u2019m more on time, I mean it wouldn\u2019t be a 20 minute walk, it would be a 10 minute walk. But I could walk to the subway to get to therapy. Today I actually took the bus, which is like a block from the house. Whereas the T is more like a 10 minute walk from my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so, that would be something. You come to therapy every week, so that\u2019s already built into the schedule. If you just push when you leave your house by, or even walking home. Then you\u2019re not rushing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, the thing is, Sydney, his therapy is after mine, so he\u2019ll come in the car and we\u2019ll both drive back. I guess I could just walk back without him, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re probably less likely. If you know he\u2019s here with the car, you\u2019re less likely to do that, right? You want to make it something that it\u2019s easy to say yes to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe like in the middle of the week, getting bubble tea. That would probably be worth it. Then I only get the bubble tea if I walk to the tea, and back from the tea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so if you made that the scheduled, and then you\u2019re maybe ready for therapy, or for tonight\u2019s day, it\u2019s an extra bonus walk to the tea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: It feels like it\u2019s not enough since it\u2019s only like a 10 minute walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not enough to lose the weight quickly, but it\u2019s more than what you\u2019re doing now. And what we want to avoid is for that all or nothing category. You sometimes set yourself up, because if it\u2019s not enough to reach the final goal, it feels like it\u2019s not worth doing at all. And you really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">want to build in, it\u2019s more than you\u2019re doing now, so it\u2019s a step in that direction. Once you get used to doing that level, it\u2019s easier to add more. It\u2019s very unlikely that you\u2019re going to maintain a drastic change. So, if you want to maintain these changes, which is what you really need to do, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">Because it really needs to be a lifestyle change. But people don\u2019t really dramatically change their lifestyles, and keep it by doing it all at once. The way you can make it a consistent change is by doing little things that you get used to, and then that just feels like that\u2019s the status quo. I always <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200913\">get out my door and walk to tea, rather than jump on the bus. When it feels like the status quo, it\u2019s really easy to do. So making these smaller changes that you can practice until they feel normal. And then, you can make another little change that you practice until it feels normal. And that way it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200914\">doesn\u2019t feel taxing, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re depriving yourself of things. It just feels normal, and then you really see the difference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: I guess (pause), I guess one of the barriers to me walking a lot is often what I\u2019m carrying. Because I\u2019m like, oh, if I want out of the house more, I could combine it with applying for jobs. Then I\u2019d be carrying my laptop, which would make me less likely to walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not a comfortable walk, I understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I should be able to combine these somehow, but I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Would it be more comfortable with a backpack?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: I mean, if I had my laptop, it would be a backpack. Because it has the pocket in it. I\u2019ve tried maybe once, having my laptop in my knitting bag. And that\u2019s really uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It feels easier if it\u2019s balanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Maybe in the backpack. It\u2019s just also, I have one backpack, this backpack has all my meds in them. When I was going back and forth between staying at my place and staying at Sydney\u2019 place, the easiest way to make sure that I had all my meds was just to permanently keep them in my backpack. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">guess this could be like, if I got a new backpack, one that\u2019s just used for carrying a laptop, then it wouldn\u2019t have all that other stuff weighing it down. Because my laptop\u2019s not that heavy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Well, the idea you had. Sort of making it the middle of the week. Walking to go get tea. That way you don\u2019t have to be carrying your laptop. You can enjoy the walk more if you\u2019re not carrying things, and get used to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that seems doable. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: How are things going with Sydney?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: They\u2019ve been better for the past few days. We got in a fight on, like, Thursday. But we\u2019ve been good since then. I guess we also got in a fight Wednesday night, too, which sort of led to Thursday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: The same issue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well, whatever it was Wednesday night, what happened then was Thursday, he was going to go to therapy. But then he was upset. For him, if we fight, he will be sad about it the next day. Which is something so incomprehensible to me. I just don\u2019t understand it. Because even if we make up or whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">and stop fighting, I\u2019ll be like, okay, that fight is over. But he really can\u2019t deal with fighting. So he was going to not go to therapy, but in the end I drove him over there. He got there 20 minutes late but was able to stay after with his therapist. He wants me to believe in him, and sometimes I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB2\">trouble doing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Believe in him, what do you mean? What does he need?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Well, I guess believe in that he\u2019s capable of doing things, and getting over his depression. Stuff like that. I\u2019ve seen so much evidence of him making really bad decisions, it just makes it that much harder. Once he does start making what I believe to be a bad decision, what\u2019s the point of trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">to argue him out of it? Because, like, at this point, when I was like, I guess you\u2019re not going to therapy. What he wanted me to do was to try and tell him it would be okay and that he could do it, and stuff. But it just feels like so many times, it ends up him not doing something. It\u2019s like, why do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF2\">I even bother? How am I supposed to know what it will work and when it won\u2019t work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t predict. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: No. But then I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Is it something you\u2019ve asked out loud? How do I know when it will work and when it won\u2019t? Or is that a question in your head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I did, and he was like, it doesn\u2019t hurt until you try. You never know until you try (pause). But, it\u2019s just so angering me with so many things that he\u2019s missed and stuff. If he\u2019s not doing it, he\u2019s not doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">(pause) It\u2019s worse when my schedule also gets held up by his -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, because you feel frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, like in the end. It wasn\u2019t this time, but I think Wednesday, I thought I had something on Thursday morning, which I didn\u2019t end up having. But I wanted to go to sleep at a decent hour. He was taking forever and doing something, and it just turned into -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t feel like you can go to sleep without him? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well, here\u2019s the thing. So, Wednesday night. Sydney\u2019s car has a Wallingford permit. My house is in New Haven. Across the street and down a block is Wallingford. So I have a guest pass for New Haven, which can work three days in a row, and then. So it resets on Sunday, because they don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">the rules on Sunday. So what I do, so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in New Haven, Thursday over in Wallingford. And then Friday, Saturday, back in New Haven. But that day we had gotten a call from the city of Wallingford that had said that two people had recently been assaulted walking back from Belmont. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C12\">I had rehearsal on Wednesday night, not swing dancing. I had drove there, drove back. The original plan was I was going to pick him up at my place, and we were going to park in Wallingford together and walk back. But he ended up not being able to do that. He was going to, eventually before we went to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C13\">sleep, park the car. But I needed to keep on the lights for him, so I really couldn\u2019t go to sleep before he did. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">And then it turned into a fight about other things, too. He being frustrated with his lack of libido, and everything just came out there. I probably shouldn\u2019t have let it, but it did. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to keep it about one thing when you\u2019re angry, and feeling resentful about those other things, too. Those sort of ongoing issues. How much of the time does that happen? Where a fight about one thing becomes a fight about all of those issues? Or issues in addition to the particular incident?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: I\u2019d say between 50 and 75 percent of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: So lots. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Not all the time. There\u2019s like at least a 25% of the time where it doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: What does it mean to you that most of the time it becomes about that other stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: I mean, I\u2019ve always had a habit of grouping similar events together, and noticing patterns, and stuff. Something became that, plus all the times before it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Well, when it\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s a pattern. But when it goes from you said you would help me pack the car to I\u2019m frustrated about your lack of libido, that\u2019s not a pattern. They\u2019re legitimate things. They\u2019re both things you\u2019re concerned about. One, his ability to follow through on plans, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">and the issue of feeling sexually attracted to you, and being interested in sex in general, is certainly another issue about which you can have concerns. But those are not related. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: I mean, logically, you\u2019re correct. It\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: How are they related for you emotionally?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: They\u2019re both ways in which Sydney disappoints me. (pause) I guess it\u2019s also frustrating because I\u2019ve been doing all the Music over (ph), and I kind of wanted some alone time. And if I pushed out, he could just go to his place for the night, or something. But he didn\u2019t want to go out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, why can\u2019t he do that? Why can\u2019t he spend nights apart?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess if we had planned on doing it earlier, it would have been fine. But you don\u2019t ask someone to do that at, like, midnight. That\u2019s really not fair to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: How often do you spend nights apart? Do you get alone time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t. He gets alone time because, I\u2019m the one who is, you know, going out to all the music rehearsals, going out dancing. Trying to have a social life again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s not doing that stuff on his own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: He\u2019s not. Sometimes every few weeks he might get brunch with his friend Elliott. It\u2019s not that often, and usually it\u2019s in the morning, and I end up just going back to sleep anyways. I guess that\u2019s kind of alone time, but it doesn\u2019t feel like alone time, because it\u2019s asleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right. No, it\u2019s a difference. And they\u2019re both necessary. Sleeping and having time to yourself. Relaxation is really important. I wonder if that\u2019s one of the reasons you\u2019re feeling frustrated, is that you don\u2019t have that time to yourself. And why it feels like you don\u2019t really have free time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">even though you\u2019re not working, and there\u2019s hours available in the days to do things. You\u2019re not really on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) A lot of the times we\u2019ll both want to listen to something, or whatever, and that\u2019ll cut into if I was feeling motivated to write a cover letter, or something like that. And we at least worked around it the last time, by being like, okay, can we wait until I write this cover letter. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">Sometimes he\u2019s just playing a computer game or something, in which case I have no excuse for not writing cover letters then. But none of it is alone time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">I think if I he had one activity, maybe in the daytime when I don\u2019t have an activity. Maybe one or two days a week. Then I\u2019d probably be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you\u2019re craving some independence. In a healthy relationship, there\u2019s room for that. For both people to have independence, and to choose time together. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s just the whole problem with the apartment setup, you know? There\u2019s the living room, which doesn\u2019t have a door or anything like that. There\u2019s the bedroom, and there\u2019s the bathroom. There\u2019s the kitchen, which I sort of count as part of the living room, so there\u2019s not like another <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">room for me to go off to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Right. So part of it is a space issue. The apartment isn\u2019t really set up for you both to be there and feel like there\u2019s a lot of separateness. However, you could have two people living in an apartment, and you could both have some independence, if both people were willing to give each other <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">space. He could go out, do some more of his own stuff. You could go to sleep independently. Except it seems like he\u2019s very dependent on you. The relationship has become such in that you guys rely on each other for most everything. You\u2019ve talked in the past about feeling kind of reliant on him to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF2\">something with you. Whether it be to bring the boxes down with you for recycling, or unpack stuff, or move the car. There\u2019s a lot of reliance upon each other to get tasks done or go out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: Well, this time moving the car actually was a legitimate concern. Because it was really late at night. If I had parked it during the day, I would have been fine with that. Because I had just been parking the car in Wallingford myself and walking back after Wednesday nights, usually swing dancing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">I don\u2019t know how long I should keep up being afraid to walk back by myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, safety\u2019s really important. I\u2019m kind of talking about the broader scheme of things. Types of things that are hard to talk about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, even last night I wanted to go to the after party for the concert, and he wanted to go home. So what he ended up doing was drop me off yesterday morning we had my grandmother\u2019s 89th birthday party. There was about a third of the cake leftover, maybe even half a cake. So I took it, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">we could have it for the music after party. It was in the car, so he dropped me off with the cake at the place the party was going to be, and he actually gave me money to take a cab home. Then as I was leaving, there were two other people leaving. They were going to take the subway. And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F52\">well, if Sydney is willing to meet me at the subway and walk me back, then I\u2019ll take the train with you guys and save the cab fare. And I had called up Sydney, and he was okay with that. Except by the time I got there, he wasn\u2019t, and he was like, why don\u2019t you take a cab? And I\u2019m like, I feel really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F53\">silly. There\u2019s a cab stand at the Belmont grocery store, but getting a cab from Belmont to Belmont seems like the silliest thing ever. I guess I\u2019ll just walk by myself. It ended up being the other music people were willing to get a little out of their way to walk me back, because it was only like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F54\">10 minute walk. But it was kind of frustrating. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because he sort of changed his mind so rapidly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess it was 20 or 30 minutes later, but still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: But it feels really unreliable. And that\u2019s what you were feeling angry about in the argument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: No, because the argument well, I guess, yes, but not from that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Not from that time, but that same thing. Right, when you talk about patterns, that\u2019s the pattern that you\u2019re unhappy with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really know what I can do about it right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t control it. But you can decide whether or not you\u2019re willing to live with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: I guess the only real way around it would just be to never do anything that relies on him again. Like, you know, instead of calling, I should have just taken the car back instead. But I wanted to get that walk in there, from Stanford Central.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">(pause) At the time, it felt like it was a good decision because I\u2019m like, oh, I\u2019m saving up the money for the cab.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Mhm. It was a good decision for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: Except for the part at the end, where he could meet me at Belmont. (pause) Yeah, we actually have our first couples\u2019 session on Wednesday. Though I don\u2019t know what to expect. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just sort of normal therapy. Can you tell me what couples counseling is like? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I can tell you what couples counseling is like with me (chuckling). It probably bears some resemblance. In the first session, it would be a lot like the first session of an individual therapy session. Where I would ask both people to talk a little bit about why they chose to come, what was <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D1\">going on, what prompted them to seek therapy together. I usually let them pick who wants to talk first. So, the similarity would certainly be in that, your first session you usually talk about what your issue is. Why are you coming to therapy, what you want to get out of it. What are your goals? It <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D2\">feels a little bit different sometimes, because you\u2019ll be talking in front of each other. When I do couples therapy, I never have people in the room separately. Some therapists do. So that\u2019s one difference, and I don\u2019t know. Who did you end up going with? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Okay, so some therapists will do part of the time with each person separately, and then part of the time with each of them together. So I don\u2019t know about her method. After the first session, usually you kind of let people talk about a little bit about what happened each week, to sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F1\">get the ball rolling. What I like to do is really observe patterns of communication. Because I think one of the things that really affects relationships is how people talk to each other. It\u2019s a lot of what you talk about being a problem between you and Sydney, is how can you guys really express what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F2\">you\u2019re feeling? His intolerance, or inability to tolerate when you\u2019re angry with him, that\u2019s something that I would really work on. Kind of figuring out what makes it feel so intolerable to him, how are ways that you can express what you\u2019re feeling to him that don\u2019t feel so toxic. And are there ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F3\">that he can also work on maybe being more open to hearing what you\u2019re saying, and finding some techniques for that to work in both directions. Sometimes that involves practicing having arguments in the session, with the therapist helping to maintain a level of intensity that feels safe for everybody. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F4\">Does that answer some of your question? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2010E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s not like individual therapy, where you might have individual therapy for the rest of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah, usually not. Usually it\u2019s shorter term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">CLIENT: Like, is it usually a couple months? It\u2019s a year?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: It can really vary. So it could be a few months. It could be a year. It\u2019s usually not forever, because usually people are coming because they have a specific goal of trying to figure out whether or not the relationship\u2019s going to work, or figure out some techniques that they can then evolve <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201171\">in their lives themselves. So you can kind of work on those, get them comfortable, and move on without the therapist. Sometimes people use it as sort of checking back in. You\u2019re going with a very specific question of: are there things we can change in the relationship to make it work? Or are these things <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201172\">not changeable? And therefore you don\u2019t want to continue. Is that correct? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">CLIENT: Mhm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">THERAPIST: One thing you might set with the therapist is how long do you want to give it? And what are the markers that you would use to see if you\u2019re being able to make progress toward making it feel sustainable. Then you can kind of set those time limits. Is that a year? Is that three months? is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B1\">two years? It\u2019s not forever. I know you know that. You\u2019ve said to me it\u2019s not forever. You don\u2019t want it to be like this, you don\u2019t want the relationship to continue this way forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m just wondering. I assume it\u2019s going to be like way harder than a normal, like, if you had a couple where neither party was depressed. I\u2019m sure his depression is not going to help things, or my depression is not going to help things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s part of the reason why you guys are having trouble. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t know if we would have just not had any trouble in the first place if he hadn\u2019t gotten depressed in the first place. I assume we would have eventually butted heads on something, but I don\u2019t think it would be nearly this bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">THERAPIST: Things felt very different at the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was just such a short period of time before he got depressed, and (pause) is there anything I should do to, like, prepare for couples counseling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">THERAPIST: Have you two talked together about what your goals are? Are there things that you\u2019d be afraid to say? That might be something you want to do. If you want to be able to be honest in front of him, and not feel like you\u2019re not saying things because he\u2019s there. You said you have a session on <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201271\">Wednesday. So sometime today or tomorrow, you might want to sit down and talk about, hey, what are your ideas about why you want to go. What do you want to get out of it? And then you can share with him what you want to get out of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s not just going to say, oh, I\u2019m going because you wanted to go. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. He knows we\u2019ve been fighting, and he does think it would be helpful, too. But I\u2019m not sure he has any clearly articulated goals. I guess I\u2019m just also afraid of him being, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201291\">yeah, I just can\u2019t have this conversation right now, and that into Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Hm. And if he does, then you\u2019ve opened up the opportunity to talk about it before you get there. Another purpose of having the couples counseling is if the conversations are too difficult to have on your own, the therapist\u2019s office provides a place where you are going to address this stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B1\">And the therapist can help support him in having the conversation so this stuff doesn\u2019t just get pushed off and never discussed. So, if he says no I can\u2019t have this conversation right now, you can honor that and say, okay, we\u2019re going to have the conversation on Wednesday during our time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah. He sometimes ends up canceling therapy when he feels too bad. Usually it\u2019s more of a physical than emotional thing, but I\u2019ve seen him, like, panic himself out of therapy before. And it\u2019s like, isn\u2019t that the reason why you need to go therapy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F\">THERAPIST: I hope he\u2019ll really be able to commit and go with you. Because you can\u2019t do couples therapy by yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20131\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s anything I can do to make it easier on him ahead of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20133\">THERAPIST: Well, you can ask him that. That\u2019s a very supportive thing to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20135\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll ask him that when I see him. For some reason, I\u2019m very nervous about this and I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20137\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s normal to be nervous. You\u2019re meeting a new person. You haven\u2019t done this mode of therapy before. It\u2019s a scary thing to go and do because the decision of whether or not you want to stay in a relationship is a big one. You know that part of the reason you\u2019re going to therapy is <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201371\">to try and answer that question for yourself. Really confronting that can be anxiety producing. Avoiding the question really hasn\u2019t been good for you either. I think it\u2019s a healthy step to try and address it with him, and make the relationship better for both of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20139\">CLIENT: I guess it will be like a mutual thing. Me and him will both have to assess after the fact whether or not we clicked with the therapist, or if we have to...yeah. She had given me six, and since you had given me two therapists, and both of them had been busy, I ended up calling up the four out <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201391\">of the six in New Haven. One was full and the other three got back to me. So this is one of the three, but then there are like those other two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Might still be contenders if this one doesn\u2019t feel like a good match. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D\">CLIENT: Two of them called me back the day that I called them, but it was while I was busy doing other things. The third one, the one I ended up going with called me when I was free. I hadn\u2019t gotten around to calling the other ones back (chuckling). I\u2019m like, is this really a good way to but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D1\">not like I want to compare people ahead of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t get that much information talking with someone on the phone. Sometimes you can get a little bit of a vibe, but you really have to sit with someone and see if it\u2019s a good match. Sometimes you get lucky, and the first person that you sit with feels like a good match. And if not, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F1\">okay to shop around. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2013E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20141\">CLIENT: Whether or not a good match for me and a good match for Sydney are the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20143\">THERAPIST: Sometimes, not always.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20145\">CLIENT: I mean, at least we\u2019re both coming from places of, like (pause), not hating each other. Wanting things to work. I want the therapist to be someone who works both for him and for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there should be no side. There\u2019s no sides (pause). Anything else we should catch up on before next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20149\">CLIENT: We talked about jobs, we talked about healthiness, we talked about Sydney. (pause) Dad (ph) told me to bring up one of the times that I got panicked, and like (pause), even thought I\u2019d brought it up before. Like, how to calm down when I\u2019m panicked. And I told him that you told me how I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201491\">to think about how something is temporary. But it really seems that the only way my panic goes away is for me to get distracted, or something. He\u2019s not really happy with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s not. Do you feel content with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014D\">CLIENT: Not really either, but I feel like there\u2019s not much I can do about it. I think he feels like there probably is something more I could do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Are there distractions that you could seek out to help move that process along?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20151\">CLIENT: (pause) It depends what I\u2019m doing. Because sometimes if I seek out a distraction, it will take away the panic for as long as the distraction is there. And then when the distraction is over, the panic comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">THERAPIST: But other times it\u2019s gone. So it feels kind of out of your control still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I think when I try to make it go away, it won\u2019t go away. It will only go away on its own eventually sometime. I can\u2019t just go on the Internet or something. Because it\u2019s not enough of a distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20157\">THERAPIST: What does he do when he panics, to help it go away? Or help it get under control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20159\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think he does a good job of getting it under control either (chuckling), to tell you the truth. Usually, because for me, it\u2019s out of nowhere. For him, it\u2019s because he has to do something. He really doesn\u2019t like deadlines, and there are lots of things that have deadlines on them, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201591\">know? You have to be at the review by X time. We have to make the seder for Passover, etcetera. So for him, it\u2019s like either he eventually calms down and does the thing, telling him it\u2019s going to be okay, or he misses the event and isn\u2019t panicking anymore because he doesn\u2019t have to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Right, because he successfully avoided it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so he\u2019s also not the greatest at getting rid of panic, either (pause). I guess he\u2019s sort of really confused by that, that my panic doesn\u2019t usually have a visible trigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F\">THERAPIST: But the panic feels the same, whether there\u2019s an identifiable trigger, or whether it feels like it\u2019s just out of the blue. And a lot of times, panic attacks are very much out of the blue, you know? Some people experience them in the middle of the night, when it\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F1\">be an identifiable trigger. But people wake up feeling that panic. So if a mental distraction is not enough, combining some of the physical techniques that we\u2019ve talked about. To actually work on the physical symptoms of panic. So things that help you to slow down your breathing, or sometimes warmth <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F2\">can be very soothing. As your mind is going in those worries, your body is also responding. So if you can combine the mental distraction with something like deep breathing. Singing can help you to do that, right, without even thinking about it. Because sometimes you\u2019re focusing on your breath. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F3\">we\u2019ve done that in here and sometimes that makes you feel more anxious because you become very aware of the bodily signs. But singing makes you control your breath. And so singing a song as you do something might help. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2015E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20161\">CLIENT: I could do that when I\u2019m by myself. I feel really self-conscious doing that if there\u2019s anyone else around. Sydney included.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20163\">THERAPIST: Okay. Can you go into a room by yourself? Or go take a shower and sing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20165\">CLIENT: I guess I could go to the bathroom or something. If the shower were on, you wouldn\u2019t be able to hear me singing. If it isn\u2019t on, we don\u2019t have a bathroom fan or anything to hide the noise. It\u2019s a very small apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20167\">THERAPIST: In an extreme circumstance, like if you\u2019re feeling really panicked, it might be worth it to go hop in the shower and sing, and see if that is enough to distract you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20169\">CLIENT: I guess I always forget that there are physical things to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and they\u2019re big. Because that popping back up is often because your body is still sort of ramped up. Doing some of the breath work, or seeking out some sort of physical sensation that\u2019s different. Whether that be warmth, or seeking out a fabric or a texture, or a soft yarn, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2016B1\">it can be soothing. And then can help to calm your body down. So you might want to give those a try if it pops up this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t we stop there, and I will see you next Monday?

I did end up going and applying at the store, though I didn\u2019t have my resume printed out. So I just did the application, and, like, it wasn\u2019t as ready as if I had a few process and stuff (ph). I didn\u2019t want to undersell myself, and they said they have competitive pay. But I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">not sure what competitive pay for retail is. So, I think I requested an amount I should have just written negotiable, but obviously I wasn\u2019t thinking straight when I filled it. I mean, if I don\u2019t get it, I don\u2019t get it. But at least I did it. And then I applied for the job that I was telling you about. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">There was also this part time job in a local middle school. It was posted on the listserv. So, it has both current grad students and people who stayed on the list afterwards. I did the application anyways, but made it be just the same e-mail. It was Friday after business hours, so I didn\u2019t know when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">she\u2019d get back to me. So I was just like, you know, I don\u2019t know if this is open to non-students. If it is, here\u2019s my application stuff. She wrote me back this morning thanking me, so I guess if it wasn\u2019t open to non-students, she would have said something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Well, good for you. You took three really solid steps. How did it feel to ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: It felt, well, I guess, applying to the retail place I have all the second guessing myself afterwards. But the other stuff felt really good to get out. Tara has a friend who works there, who I actually met a couple of years ago, and she showed me around the zoo. I sent her an e-mail letting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">her know I applied, but she never wrote me back. So I\u2019m hoping I didn\u2019t write anything offensive or anything. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so I basically told her that, you know, I wasn\u2019t sure if she remembered me, but I really enjoyed when she had given me the tour, and I thought it was a really nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">place to work. This position opened, and I thought it would be good. I applied through the normal channels, but here\u2019s my resume. Let me know if you think it would be a good fit. And she never wrote me back, so I don\u2019t know if she just I hope it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a terrible fit for the position. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It certainly doesn\u2019t sound offensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Oh, good. I guess not offensive so much as I was asking too much, and being too pushy. But that\u2019s the problem with networking. It always feels that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: It is, networking. Not pushy, but it\u2019s okay to ask for what you want. Pushy is demanding what you want, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I guess I feels like I\u2019m asking for a lot for someone who\u2019s never worked for me. You know, if it was like Tara working there, I\u2019d be like, hey, Tara, I\u2019m going to apply here, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a closer connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah, whereas it\u2019s, like, a friend of Tara\u2019s. I think Tara has only told her good things about me because she really liked me, but still. This person has never worked with me, so all they have to go on is their friend\u2019s words and my resume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not as strong of a connection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: (pause) I haven\u2019t actually searched the sites recently, so there might be more things to apply to. The stuff I found on our cascade (ph) was -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: When was the last time you looked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: This morning. They had posted something, which is all the way at the other end of Vermont. And I\u2019m like, hell no, that\u2019s a two hour drive each way. Hell no. I wasn\u2019t sure how far away Stockbridge was until I looked it up. Because I had been there before, but only coming from Connecticut. But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">yeah, the other stuff. There was the one I had applied for, and the other stuff looked like it was from too long ago, that I should probably look at more current things and apply for those instead. I feel like if a job was posted April 1st, it\u2019s probably too late at this point to apply. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Do they take stuff down after it\u2019s been filled?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if they do. Like, they\u2019re not really a natural job site. They\u2019re a blog that posts. I guess I could click on the links, which I didn\u2019t bother doing, and I could see. I guess the link would show whether or not the position is still open. Though I feel like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: If there\u2019s something that\u2019s a really good fit, maybe it\u2019s worth -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s worth it, it\u2019s worth it. Yeah. Oh yeah, there was one at the R.I. Public Zoo and I (shudders), I hate the R.I. Public Zoo so much. It\u2019s, like, the worst policy. I guess I could see how it could be an economic opportunity thing, like if you have people who are less affluent who live in actual <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">R.I., and if you assume that the people who are more affluent or living in New Haven, then I could see it being an equalizer, and that\u2019s why it would only be open to R.I. residents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s also lots of sections, right. I think people living in nearby, are (chuckling) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah. They\u2019re probably a lot better off than I am. It actually makes no sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s been limiting for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even look at the postings anymore. Because if I look, I see how I might be a really good fit, and it\u2019ll just make me sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(pause) I\u2019m definitely not going to make the June deadline of getting a job in time for me to renew the lease. But I\u2019m hoping that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Have you talked to your parents? If you had an offer in hand but hadn\u2019t started?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I think if I had an offer in hand, they\u2019d be fine with it. I haven\u2019t talked to them, but, like, I\u2019m not going to get an offer in hand in the next month (pause). Like, the one at the middle school is only 15 hours a week, so I don\u2019t know how much it pays. It still might be worth it for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">take it, but it might not be enough to pay for my own place. I guess I could supplement it with the NOKIA (ph) job if I get that, too, and then maybe it would be enough. But, like, I don\u2019t know if I get an interview, if that interview would be before the end of May. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, they would have to move on a fast timeline to get a response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: And I feel like a lot of things don\u2019t move on a fast timeline. (pause) Yeah, I\u2019ll probably have to do the whole apartment search again thing, and I\u2019m really hoping I don\u2019t have to move back with my parents. Because I\u2019d really like something full time. The one at the Schlesinger is actually full-time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">and permanent. I don\u2019t know if I should start looking for part-time stuff in Connecticut instead. But then that would just make me more stuck there, I think. It would be nice to be making money while I\u2019m there. If I\u2019m there. Which I\u2019m really hoping that I won\u2019t be there. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">(pause) Yeah, I need to look at more things. I\u2019m just afraid that maybe I\u2019ve already missed the season of all the stuff being posted, and all the academic positions, and I just screwed myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t go back, you can\u2019t go back in time. You can\u2019t let your fear of that stop you from looking at what\u2019s available now, and following through on things. Even if that means clicking on older links and seeing if they\u2019re still open. If you\u2019re afraid that you\u2019ve missed things, then you need <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">to be more diligent about catching, rather than avoiding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I feel like the later, unless it\u2019s a really good fit, the later you go, they\u2019ve seen a lot of candidates. If they\u2019re going to consider you later, the bar is set much higher for later candidates. Because you have to be better than all the candidates they\u2019ve already seen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: So are you telling me why you can\u2019t look at things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I can look at them. I\u2019m telling you why it might be a waste of time to apply to them. I mean, I guess I can start with the ones that are newer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You have plenty of time. When you were working and trying to look for a job, then your time was limited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: A waste of my emotional energy. Which is more limited than my time is. I guess I do have all the time now, especially now that the Takeo concert is over now, so I don\u2019t have anything going on on Sundays or Tuesdays. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: So if it\u2019s the emotional energy that feels limiting, how can we make it so that it requires less energy to pursue these? Because the only way to get a job is to apply to jobs, and sometimes lots of them. And so, I think we need to find ways to make it a little bit less taxing. To make it <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">less anxiety-producing. So that you can really apply to everything that would be an option. It doesn\u2019t make sense to expend energy applying to things that are not really options. But if something is interesting, and in your field, and open, then it\u2019s an option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know, I mean, maybe if I reward myself enough, that would be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: How did you get yourself to do the applications that you ticked off when you came in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: So the alumni, this was mid-March, they started an e-mail being like, hey, are people interested in fitness? And I\u2019m like, oh, I totally need to lose all the weight, and stuff. Then there was like, oh, there\u2019s this thing online okay, are you familiar with RPGs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Nope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Okay, RPGs are role playing games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, I know what that is. I just didn\u2019t know the abbreviation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Okay, so you know how you have a character and it levels up, and you have a party and stuff? So there\u2019s this thing called Have It RPG, where you can create a party with your real-life friends, and the way you level up is by doing tasks. And those tasks are things you enter yourself. You can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">mark them as easy, medium, hard. You can have daily things that you need to do, and will hurt the party if you don\u2019t do them. And so, I have things like <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: You feel really accountable to the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, and then I can get things like, go to grocery store, or send this application.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: So you used that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: So I used that, which got me those two. Of course, I\u2019m still afraid to set, even as a daily or weekly exercise, because -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: What do you count? Do you count going dancing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do. I didn\u2019t want to do it this week because I didn\u2019t go to swing dancing because of my rehearsals. I guess I could start doing that, and then maybe that\u2019ll force me. It\u2019s pretty easy for me to get to swing dancing, but it\u2019s a lot harder for me to get to country dancing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: But you could just have it be dancing, and then if you get to one or the other, you get to check it off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I could do that, but then I\u2019m only dancing once a week. It\u2019s not really helping. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Except that is the bare minimum. Because you\u2019re always allowed to do extra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, but what I\u2019m setting, the bare minimum is what I\u2019m already doing. And that\u2019s already what I\u2019m doing anyways, so it\u2019s already there. It\u2019s more whether or not I should start stretching my goals. You know, do I want to make myself go on a 20-minute walk every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: So, when you\u2019re setting a goal, you want it to be a little higher than what you\u2019re doing, but totally reachable. Because you can always increase your goal, right? So, what would be that? What would be one little increment more than what you\u2019re already doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Maybe if I, like (pause)...because the way it\u2019s set up, you have things that are dailies, and you can mark them as certain days of the week. But that sort of commits you to doing certain days of the week, so it\u2019s a little bit harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: So you can\u2019t set something up as a once a week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, you can set something up as a once a week, but it\u2019s a once a week on a specific day. So I can\u2019t be like, okay, I want to walk 20 minutes a day, at least three days a week. I guess I can set them up as specific days, and if I\u2019ve done them high that day <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: So if you set it on Tuesday\/Thursday, maybe if you walk on Monday\/Tuesday, you could give yourself a click on a Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Exactly. I guess I could do that. (pause) Yeah, I feel like adding 20 minute walks would probably be helpful. I did a lot of walking yesterday, but, yeah, it\u2019s still not something I\u2019m doing regular, it\u2019s still like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Is there a place you typically walk to? Like is there an errand you can do by foot? Or is there a place you can go for coffee? Can you build it into something that would be sort of in the schedule already? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: If I\u2019m more on time, I mean it wouldn\u2019t be a 20 minute walk, it would be a 10 minute walk. But I could walk to the subway to get to therapy. Today I actually took the bus, which is like a block from the house. Whereas the T is more like a 10 minute walk from my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so, that would be something. You come to therapy every week, so that\u2019s already built into the schedule. If you just push when you leave your house by, or even walking home. Then you\u2019re not rushing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, the thing is, Sydney, his therapy is after mine, so he\u2019ll come in the car and we\u2019ll both drive back. I guess I could just walk back without him, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re probably less likely. If you know he\u2019s here with the car, you\u2019re less likely to do that, right? You want to make it something that it\u2019s easy to say yes to.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, maybe like in the middle of the week, getting bubble tea. That would probably be worth it. Then I only get the bubble tea if I walk to the tea, and back from the tea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so if you made that the scheduled, and then you\u2019re maybe ready for therapy, or for tonight\u2019s day, it\u2019s an extra bonus walk to the tea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: It feels like it\u2019s not enough since it\u2019s only like a 10 minute walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not enough to lose the weight quickly, but it\u2019s more than what you\u2019re doing now. And what we want to avoid is for that all or nothing category. You sometimes set yourself up, because if it\u2019s not enough to reach the final goal, it feels like it\u2019s not worth doing at all. And you really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">want to build in, it\u2019s more than you\u2019re doing now, so it\u2019s a step in that direction. Once you get used to doing that level, it\u2019s easier to add more. It\u2019s very unlikely that you\u2019re going to maintain a drastic change. So, if you want to maintain these changes, which is what you really need to do, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200912\">Because it really needs to be a lifestyle change. But people don\u2019t really dramatically change their lifestyles, and keep it by doing it all at once. The way you can make it a consistent change is by doing little things that you get used to, and then that just feels like that\u2019s the status quo. I always <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200913\">get out my door and walk to tea, rather than jump on the bus. When it feels like the status quo, it\u2019s really easy to do. So making these smaller changes that you can practice until they feel normal. And then, you can make another little change that you practice until it feels normal. And that way it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200914\">doesn\u2019t feel taxing, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re depriving yourself of things. It just feels normal, and then you really see the difference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: I guess (pause), I guess one of the barriers to me walking a lot is often what I\u2019m carrying. Because I\u2019m like, oh, if I want out of the house more, I could combine it with applying for jobs. Then I\u2019d be carrying my laptop, which would make me less likely to walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not a comfortable walk, I understand that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I should be able to combine these somehow, but I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Would it be more comfortable with a backpack?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: I mean, if I had my laptop, it would be a backpack. Because it has the pocket in it. I\u2019ve tried maybe once, having my laptop in my knitting bag. And that\u2019s really uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: It feels easier if it\u2019s balanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Maybe in the backpack. It\u2019s just also, I have one backpack, this backpack has all my meds in them. When I was going back and forth between staying at my place and staying at Sydney\u2019 place, the easiest way to make sure that I had all my meds was just to permanently keep them in my backpack. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">guess this could be like, if I got a new backpack, one that\u2019s just used for carrying a laptop, then it wouldn\u2019t have all that other stuff weighing it down. Because my laptop\u2019s not that heavy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Well, the idea you had. Sort of making it the middle of the week. Walking to go get tea. That way you don\u2019t have to be carrying your laptop. You can enjoy the walk more if you\u2019re not carrying things, and get used to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that seems doable. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: How are things going with Sydney?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: They\u2019ve been better for the past few days. We got in a fight on, like, Thursday. But we\u2019ve been good since then. I guess we also got in a fight Wednesday night, too, which sort of led to Thursday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: The same issue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Well, whatever it was Wednesday night, what happened then was Thursday, he was going to go to therapy. But then he was upset. For him, if we fight, he will be sad about it the next day. Which is something so incomprehensible to me. I just don\u2019t understand it. Because even if we make up or whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB1\">and stop fighting, I\u2019ll be like, okay, that fight is over. But he really can\u2019t deal with fighting. So he was going to not go to therapy, but in the end I drove him over there. He got there 20 minutes late but was able to stay after with his therapist. He wants me to believe in him, and sometimes I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB2\">trouble doing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Believe in him, what do you mean? What does he need?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Well, I guess believe in that he\u2019s capable of doing things, and getting over his depression. Stuff like that. I\u2019ve seen so much evidence of him making really bad decisions, it just makes it that much harder. Once he does start making what I believe to be a bad decision, what\u2019s the point of trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">to argue him out of it? Because, like, at this point, when I was like, I guess you\u2019re not going to therapy. What he wanted me to do was to try and tell him it would be okay and that he could do it, and stuff. But it just feels like so many times, it ends up him not doing something. It\u2019s like, why do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF2\">I even bother? How am I supposed to know what it will work and when it won\u2019t work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t predict. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: No. But then I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Is it something you\u2019ve asked out loud? How do I know when it will work and when it won\u2019t? Or is that a question in your head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: I did, and he was like, it doesn\u2019t hurt until you try. You never know until you try (pause). But, it\u2019s just so angering me with so many things that he\u2019s missed and stuff. If he\u2019s not doing it, he\u2019s not doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">(pause) It\u2019s worse when my schedule also gets held up by his -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, because you feel frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, like in the end. It wasn\u2019t this time, but I think Wednesday, I thought I had something on Thursday morning, which I didn\u2019t end up having. But I wanted to go to sleep at a decent hour. He was taking forever and doing something, and it just turned into -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t feel like you can go to sleep without him? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Well, here\u2019s the thing. So, Wednesday night. Sydney\u2019s car has a Wallingford permit. My house is in New Haven. Across the street and down a block is Wallingford. So I have a guest pass for New Haven, which can work three days in a row, and then. So it resets on Sunday, because they don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C11\">the rules on Sunday. So what I do, so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in New Haven, Thursday over in Wallingford. And then Friday, Saturday, back in New Haven. But that day we had gotten a call from the city of Wallingford that had said that two people had recently been assaulted walking back from Belmont. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C12\">I had rehearsal on Wednesday night, not swing dancing. I had drove there, drove back. The original plan was I was going to pick him up at my place, and we were going to park in Wallingford together and walk back. But he ended up not being able to do that. He was going to, eventually before we went to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C13\">sleep, park the car. But I needed to keep on the lights for him, so I really couldn\u2019t go to sleep before he did. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">And then it turned into a fight about other things, too. He being frustrated with his lack of libido, and everything just came out there. I probably shouldn\u2019t have let it, but it did. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to keep it about one thing when you\u2019re angry, and feeling resentful about those other things, too. Those sort of ongoing issues. How much of the time does that happen? Where a fight about one thing becomes a fight about all of those issues? Or issues in addition to the particular incident?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: I\u2019d say between 50 and 75 percent of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: So lots. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Not all the time. There\u2019s like at least a 25% of the time where it doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: What does it mean to you that most of the time it becomes about that other stuff?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: I mean, I\u2019ve always had a habit of grouping similar events together, and noticing patterns, and stuff. Something became that, plus all the times before it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Well, when it\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s a pattern. But when it goes from you said you would help me pack the car to I\u2019m frustrated about your lack of libido, that\u2019s not a pattern. They\u2019re legitimate things. They\u2019re both things you\u2019re concerned about. One, his ability to follow through on plans, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">and the issue of feeling sexually attracted to you, and being interested in sex in general, is certainly another issue about which you can have concerns. But those are not related. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: I mean, logically, you\u2019re correct. It\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: How are they related for you emotionally?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: They\u2019re both ways in which Sydney disappoints me. (pause) I guess it\u2019s also frustrating because I\u2019ve been doing all the Music over (ph), and I kind of wanted some alone time. And if I pushed out, he could just go to his place for the night, or something. But he didn\u2019t want to go out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, why can\u2019t he do that? Why can\u2019t he spend nights apart?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess if we had planned on doing it earlier, it would have been fine. But you don\u2019t ask someone to do that at, like, midnight. That\u2019s really not fair to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: How often do you spend nights apart? Do you get alone time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t. He gets alone time because, I\u2019m the one who is, you know, going out to all the music rehearsals, going out dancing. Trying to have a social life again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s not doing that stuff on his own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: He\u2019s not. Sometimes every few weeks he might get brunch with his friend Elliott. It\u2019s not that often, and usually it\u2019s in the morning, and I end up just going back to sleep anyways. I guess that\u2019s kind of alone time, but it doesn\u2019t feel like alone time, because it\u2019s asleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right. No, it\u2019s a difference. And they\u2019re both necessary. Sleeping and having time to yourself. Relaxation is really important. I wonder if that\u2019s one of the reasons you\u2019re feeling frustrated, is that you don\u2019t have that time to yourself. And why it feels like you don\u2019t really have free time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">even though you\u2019re not working, and there\u2019s hours available in the days to do things. You\u2019re not really on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) A lot of the times we\u2019ll both want to listen to something, or whatever, and that\u2019ll cut into if I was feeling motivated to write a cover letter, or something like that. And we at least worked around it the last time, by being like, okay, can we wait until I write this cover letter. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E71\">Sometimes he\u2019s just playing a computer game or something, in which case I have no excuse for not writing cover letters then. But none of it is alone time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">I think if I he had one activity, maybe in the daytime when I don\u2019t have an activity. Maybe one or two days a week. Then I\u2019d probably be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you\u2019re craving some independence. In a healthy relationship, there\u2019s room for that. For both people to have independence, and to choose time together. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s just the whole problem with the apartment setup, you know? There\u2019s the living room, which doesn\u2019t have a door or anything like that. There\u2019s the bedroom, and there\u2019s the bathroom. There\u2019s the kitchen, which I sort of count as part of the living room, so there\u2019s not like another <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">room for me to go off to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Right. So part of it is a space issue. The apartment isn\u2019t really set up for you both to be there and feel like there\u2019s a lot of separateness. However, you could have two people living in an apartment, and you could both have some independence, if both people were willing to give each other <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">space. He could go out, do some more of his own stuff. You could go to sleep independently. Except it seems like he\u2019s very dependent on you. The relationship has become such in that you guys rely on each other for most everything. You\u2019ve talked in the past about feeling kind of reliant on him to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF2\">something with you. Whether it be to bring the boxes down with you for recycling, or unpack stuff, or move the car. There\u2019s a lot of reliance upon each other to get tasks done or go out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: Well, this time moving the car actually was a legitimate concern. Because it was really late at night. If I had parked it during the day, I would have been fine with that. Because I had just been parking the car in Wallingford myself and walking back after Wednesday nights, usually swing dancing. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F11\">I don\u2019t know how long I should keep up being afraid to walk back by myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, safety\u2019s really important. I\u2019m kind of talking about the broader scheme of things. Types of things that are hard to talk about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: Yeah, even last night I wanted to go to the after party for the concert, and he wanted to go home. So what he ended up doing was drop me off yesterday morning we had my grandmother\u2019s 89th birthday party. There was about a third of the cake leftover, maybe even half a cake. So I took it, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F51\">we could have it for the music after party. It was in the car, so he dropped me off with the cake at the place the party was going to be, and he actually gave me money to take a cab home. Then as I was leaving, there were two other people leaving. They were going to take the subway. And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F52\">well, if Sydney is willing to meet me at the subway and walk me back, then I\u2019ll take the train with you guys and save the cab fare. And I had called up Sydney, and he was okay with that. Except by the time I got there, he wasn\u2019t, and he was like, why don\u2019t you take a cab? And I\u2019m like, I feel really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F53\">silly. There\u2019s a cab stand at the Belmont grocery store, but getting a cab from Belmont to Belmont seems like the silliest thing ever. I guess I\u2019ll just walk by myself. It ended up being the other music people were willing to get a little out of their way to walk me back, because it was only like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F54\">10 minute walk. But it was kind of frustrating. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because he sort of changed his mind so rapidly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess it was 20 or 30 minutes later, but still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">THERAPIST: But it feels really unreliable. And that\u2019s what you were feeling angry about in the argument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">CLIENT: No, because the argument well, I guess, yes, but not from that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Not from that time, but that same thing. Right, when you talk about patterns, that\u2019s the pattern that you\u2019re unhappy with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really know what I can do about it right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t control it. But you can decide whether or not you\u2019re willing to live with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: I guess the only real way around it would just be to never do anything that relies on him again. Like, you know, instead of calling, I should have just taken the car back instead. But I wanted to get that walk in there, from Stanford Central.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">(pause) At the time, it felt like it was a good decision because I\u2019m like, oh, I\u2019m saving up the money for the cab.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Mhm. It was a good decision for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: Except for the part at the end, where he could meet me at Belmont. (pause) Yeah, we actually have our first couples\u2019 session on Wednesday. Though I don\u2019t know what to expect. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just sort of normal therapy. Can you tell me what couples counseling is like? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: I can tell you what couples counseling is like with me (chuckling). It probably bears some resemblance. In the first session, it would be a lot like the first session of an individual therapy session. Where I would ask both people to talk a little bit about why they chose to come, what was <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D1\">going on, what prompted them to seek therapy together. I usually let them pick who wants to talk first. So, the similarity would certainly be in that, your first session you usually talk about what your issue is. Why are you coming to therapy, what you want to get out of it. What are your goals? It <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D2\">feels a little bit different sometimes, because you\u2019ll be talking in front of each other. When I do couples therapy, I never have people in the room separately. Some therapists do. So that\u2019s one difference, and I don\u2019t know. Who did you end up going with? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Okay, so some therapists will do part of the time with each person separately, and then part of the time with each of them together. So I don\u2019t know about her method. After the first session, usually you kind of let people talk about a little bit about what happened each week, to sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F1\">get the ball rolling. What I like to do is really observe patterns of communication. Because I think one of the things that really affects relationships is how people talk to each other. It\u2019s a lot of what you talk about being a problem between you and Sydney, is how can you guys really express what <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F2\">you\u2019re feeling? His intolerance, or inability to tolerate when you\u2019re angry with him, that\u2019s something that I would really work on. Kind of figuring out what makes it feel so intolerable to him, how are ways that you can express what you\u2019re feeling to him that don\u2019t feel so toxic. And are there ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F3\">that he can also work on maybe being more open to hearing what you\u2019re saying, and finding some techniques for that to work in both directions. Sometimes that involves practicing having arguments in the session, with the therapist helping to maintain a level of intensity that feels safe for everybody. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F4\">Does that answer some of your question? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2010E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20111\">CLIENT: I guess it\u2019s not like individual therapy, where you might have individual therapy for the rest of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20113\">THERAPIST: Yeah, usually not. Usually it\u2019s shorter term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20115\">CLIENT: Like, is it usually a couple months? It\u2019s a year?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20117\">THERAPIST: It can really vary. So it could be a few months. It could be a year. It\u2019s usually not forever, because usually people are coming because they have a specific goal of trying to figure out whether or not the relationship\u2019s going to work, or figure out some techniques that they can then evolve <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201171\">in their lives themselves. So you can kind of work on those, get them comfortable, and move on without the therapist. Sometimes people use it as sort of checking back in. You\u2019re going with a very specific question of: are there things we can change in the relationship to make it work? Or are these things <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201172\">not changeable? And therefore you don\u2019t want to continue. Is that correct? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20119\">CLIENT: Mhm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B\">THERAPIST: One thing you might set with the therapist is how long do you want to give it? And what are the markers that you would use to see if you\u2019re being able to make progress toward making it feel sustainable. Then you can kind of set those time limits. Is that a year? Is that three months? is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2011B1\">two years? It\u2019s not forever. I know you know that. You\u2019ve said to me it\u2019s not forever. You don\u2019t want it to be like this, you don\u2019t want the relationship to continue this way forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019m just wondering. I assume it\u2019s going to be like way harder than a normal, like, if you had a couple where neither party was depressed. I\u2019m sure his depression is not going to help things, or my depression is not going to help things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2011F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s part of the reason why you guys are having trouble. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t know if we would have just not had any trouble in the first place if he hadn\u2019t gotten depressed in the first place. I assume we would have eventually butted heads on something, but I don\u2019t think it would be nearly this bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">THERAPIST: Things felt very different at the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. It was just such a short period of time before he got depressed, and (pause) is there anything I should do to, like, prepare for couples counseling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">THERAPIST: Have you two talked together about what your goals are? Are there things that you\u2019d be afraid to say? That might be something you want to do. If you want to be able to be honest in front of him, and not feel like you\u2019re not saying things because he\u2019s there. You said you have a session on <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201271\">Wednesday. So sometime today or tomorrow, you might want to sit down and talk about, hey, what are your ideas about why you want to go. What do you want to get out of it? And then you can share with him what you want to get out of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s not just going to say, oh, I\u2019m going because you wanted to go. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. He knows we\u2019ve been fighting, and he does think it would be helpful, too. But I\u2019m not sure he has any clearly articulated goals. I guess I\u2019m just also afraid of him being, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201291\">yeah, I just can\u2019t have this conversation right now, and that into Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Hm. And if he does, then you\u2019ve opened up the opportunity to talk about it before you get there. Another purpose of having the couples counseling is if the conversations are too difficult to have on your own, the therapist\u2019s office provides a place where you are going to address this stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2012B1\">And the therapist can help support him in having the conversation so this stuff doesn\u2019t just get pushed off and never discussed. So, if he says no I can\u2019t have this conversation right now, you can honor that and say, okay, we\u2019re going to have the conversation on Wednesday during our time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah. He sometimes ends up canceling therapy when he feels too bad. Usually it\u2019s more of a physical than emotional thing, but I\u2019ve seen him, like, panic himself out of therapy before. And it\u2019s like, isn\u2019t that the reason why you need to go therapy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2012F\">THERAPIST: I hope he\u2019ll really be able to commit and go with you. Because you can\u2019t do couples therapy by yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20131\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s anything I can do to make it easier on him ahead of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20133\">THERAPIST: Well, you can ask him that. That\u2019s a very supportive thing to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20135\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll ask him that when I see him. For some reason, I\u2019m very nervous about this and I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20137\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s normal to be nervous. You\u2019re meeting a new person. You haven\u2019t done this mode of therapy before. It\u2019s a scary thing to go and do because the decision of whether or not you want to stay in a relationship is a big one. You know that part of the reason you\u2019re going to therapy is <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201371\">to try and answer that question for yourself. Really confronting that can be anxiety producing. Avoiding the question really hasn\u2019t been good for you either. I think it\u2019s a healthy step to try and address it with him, and make the relationship better for both of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20139\">CLIENT: I guess it will be like a mutual thing. Me and him will both have to assess after the fact whether or not we clicked with the therapist, or if we have to...yeah. She had given me six, and since you had given me two therapists, and both of them had been busy, I ended up calling up the four out <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201391\">of the six in New Haven. One was full and the other three got back to me. So this is one of the three, but then there are like those other two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013B\">THERAPIST: Might still be contenders if this one doesn\u2019t feel like a good match. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D\">CLIENT: Two of them called me back the day that I called them, but it was while I was busy doing other things. The third one, the one I ended up going with called me when I was free. I hadn\u2019t gotten around to calling the other ones back (chuckling). I\u2019m like, is this really a good way to but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2013D1\">not like I want to compare people ahead of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t get that much information talking with someone on the phone. Sometimes you can get a little bit of a vibe, but you really have to sit with someone and see if it\u2019s a good match. Sometimes you get lucky, and the first person that you sit with feels like a good match. And if not, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2013F1\">okay to shop around. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2013E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2013E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20141\">CLIENT: Whether or not a good match for me and a good match for Sydney are the same thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20143\">THERAPIST: Sometimes, not always.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20145\">CLIENT: I mean, at least we\u2019re both coming from places of, like (pause), not hating each other. Wanting things to work. I want the therapist to be someone who works both for him and for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20147\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there should be no side. There\u2019s no sides (pause). Anything else we should catch up on before next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20149\">CLIENT: We talked about jobs, we talked about healthiness, we talked about Sydney. (pause) Dad (ph) told me to bring up one of the times that I got panicked, and like (pause), even thought I\u2019d brought it up before. Like, how to calm down when I\u2019m panicked. And I told him that you told me how I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201491\">to think about how something is temporary. But it really seems that the only way my panic goes away is for me to get distracted, or something. He\u2019s not really happy with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s not. Do you feel content with that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014D\">CLIENT: Not really either, but I feel like there\u2019s not much I can do about it. I think he feels like there probably is something more I could do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Are there distractions that you could seek out to help move that process along?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20151\">CLIENT: (pause) It depends what I\u2019m doing. Because sometimes if I seek out a distraction, it will take away the panic for as long as the distraction is there. And then when the distraction is over, the panic comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20153\">THERAPIST: But other times it\u2019s gone. So it feels kind of out of your control still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20155\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I think when I try to make it go away, it won\u2019t go away. It will only go away on its own eventually sometime. I can\u2019t just go on the Internet or something. Because it\u2019s not enough of a distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20157\">THERAPIST: What does he do when he panics, to help it go away? Or help it get under control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20159\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think he does a good job of getting it under control either (chuckling), to tell you the truth. Usually, because for me, it\u2019s out of nowhere. For him, it\u2019s because he has to do something. He really doesn\u2019t like deadlines, and there are lots of things that have deadlines on them, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201591\">know? You have to be at the review by X time. We have to make the seder for Passover, etcetera. So for him, it\u2019s like either he eventually calms down and does the thing, telling him it\u2019s going to be okay, or he misses the event and isn\u2019t panicking anymore because he doesn\u2019t have to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015B\">THERAPIST: Right, because he successfully avoided it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so he\u2019s also not the greatest at getting rid of panic, either (pause). I guess he\u2019s sort of really confused by that, that my panic doesn\u2019t usually have a visible trigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F\">THERAPIST: But the panic feels the same, whether there\u2019s an identifiable trigger, or whether it feels like it\u2019s just out of the blue. And a lot of times, panic attacks are very much out of the blue, you know? Some people experience them in the middle of the night, when it\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F1\">be an identifiable trigger. But people wake up feeling that panic. So if a mental distraction is not enough, combining some of the physical techniques that we\u2019ve talked about. To actually work on the physical symptoms of panic. So things that help you to slow down your breathing, or sometimes warmth <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F2\">can be very soothing. As your mind is going in those worries, your body is also responding. So if you can combine the mental distraction with something like deep breathing. Singing can help you to do that, right, without even thinking about it. Because sometimes you\u2019re focusing on your breath. I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2015F3\">we\u2019ve done that in here and sometimes that makes you feel more anxious because you become very aware of the bodily signs. But singing makes you control your breath. And so singing a song as you do something might help. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2015E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2015E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561903\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20161\">CLIENT: I could do that when I\u2019m by myself. I feel really self-conscious doing that if there\u2019s anyone else around. Sydney included.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20163\">THERAPIST: Okay. Can you go into a room by yourself? Or go take a shower and sing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20165\">CLIENT: I guess I could go to the bathroom or something. If the shower were on, you wouldn\u2019t be able to hear me singing. If it isn\u2019t on, we don\u2019t have a bathroom fan or anything to hide the noise. It\u2019s a very small apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20167\">THERAPIST: In an extreme circumstance, like if you\u2019re feeling really panicked, it might be worth it to go hop in the shower and sing, and see if that is enough to distract you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20169\">CLIENT: I guess I always forget that there are physical things to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2016B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and they\u2019re big. Because that popping back up is often because your body is still sort of ramped up. Doing some of the breath work, or seeking out some sort of physical sensation that\u2019s different. Whether that be warmth, or seeking out a fabric or a texture, or a soft yarn, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2016B1\">it can be soothing. And then can help to calm your body down.
