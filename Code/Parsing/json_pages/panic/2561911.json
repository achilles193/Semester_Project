Yeah, I\u2019ve been\u2026 really been just trying to work on the paper, and I think this week I really decided that I wanted to sneak my bedtime back. And so far it\u2019s\u2026 because I was getting [inaudible] 2:30 and I was at this\u2026 getting in bed by 2:00 but you can\u2019t simply <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">fall asleep; that doesn\u2019t happen. So I shrunk it back to getting in bed by 1:20. And so I\u2019m going to keep on\u2026 and I\u2026 Jeremy\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: How long is it taking you to fall asleep after you get in bed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Well the first night, which was I think Sunday, it took me a long time. I didn\u2019t get to bed until 2:30 and I was\u2026 had my booty in bed at 2:00. [1:07] But then I went to bed at\u2026 got in bed at 1:40 on Monday and eventually fell asleep by 2:10. And this time I got into bed at 1:20 and I got to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">bed 20 minutes later. So it\u2019s getting\u2026 I\u2019m getting used to it. And Jeremy had me\u2026 I was just so annoyed because I don\u2019t like suggestions when I\u2019m sort of set upon my ways I mean it\u2019s kind of hard to change but he wanted me to install this\u2026 it\u2019s a computer program that takes away the blue lighting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">on your computer so that when you\u2019re working late at night it keeps on getting darker and darker and darker. And I tried it consistently with my second night trying and it really helped. I think I feel more restful. And I guess there is some study or some science to blue light affecting quality of sleep <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">because I was able to get up at 9:00 with Jeremy, and it made me happy. I mean yeah, I took a 30 minute nap after maybe two and a half hours later, or two hours later I took a half hour nap, but the important part is that I felt restful for the first\u2026 it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have any coffee this morning. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">[2:28] I\u2019ve been feeling really dehydrated so I mean I guess it\u2019s sort of\u2026 but I mean I\u2019m very positive that I can keep it up, going to bed earlier and earlier, because I think I have a goal of getting to bed by 12:00. But I can actually\u2026 I mean because I get frustrated when my day really doesn\u2019t get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">started until 11. And by then, to get fully ramped up and then have to go to dance right when I sort of hit max productivity, it\u2019s frustrating. But since I was starting at 9:30 in the morning and had time to think about it, I feel like my ramped up time is going to be around 3:00 versus 5:00, 6:00. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">So\u2026 because I didn\u2019t go to dance yesterday, and part of that was on\u2026 I did three hours, three\u2026 yeah, three hours of tutoring, and it\u2019s a lot. And I\u2026 one of the students\u2026 I was a former TA for the class that she\u2019s taking as a\u2026 I taught the class maybe three, four years ago and I have access to all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200117\">materials but\u2026 and she just wants to do extra problems. But I started to get very hesitant because I remembered in the guidelines that said because it\u2019s a peer tutoring council that I\u2019m working through and it says students can\u2019t use their past materials for the benefit. And so I mean I think it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200118\">to prevent\u2026 because sometimes they\u2026 the students hold onto tests and tests are shared and tests are often reused. And I can see the point of that and\u2026 but so I mean\u2026 but there\u2019s actual practice problems on sight, and I was thinking about it and I was going to send them over but then I just started freaking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200119\">out because I didn\u2019t want to\u2026 because I just I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to be getting anyone in trouble. [4:34] And it\u2019s a serious thing that letting someone\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t know. I mean of course I could count\u2026 consult the council and say are these extra practice problems that were used three years <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001110\">ago okay, and they might say yes or\u2026 but I just don\u2019t even want to contact the council because I don\u2019t want to be under suspicion that I\u2019m doing this or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20010-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20010-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561911\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20013\">THERAPIST: What do you typically use to help? What\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">CLIENT: What I do is I look at their class notes and I look at their homework and we go through the homework. And sometimes\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: Because she wants something more than just homework assignments to practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I spent an hour looking up practice problems to give them and then I was like oh shoot, I wasted a whole hour looking at practice problems and I also was still freaking out. I don\u2019t know, I have a hard time\u2026 once I freak out I have a hard time calming down because I mean just the\u2026 because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">I guess I was just starting to freak out thinking about out all the possibilities of doing something that wasn\u2019t right and how that would magnify. And I sort of see the future of everyone getting in trouble. I just\u2026 my mind focuses on the\u2026 I mean I guess it\u2019s sort of like if I saw something disgusting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">or freak out about the what if. And in a sense freaking out about the what if can prevent us from doing things that we don\u2019t\u2026 we shouldn\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s the difference between freaking out and thinking about what were you doing. [6:16] Were you thinking about the what ifs or did it feel like freaking\u2026 I guess when I hear freaking out I\u2026 it conjures up panic that\u2019s going along with the thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, there was a panic in thought because I mean even talking about the possibility of letting her see the section notes I\u2019m like did other people hear that and\u2026 because we were in a general caf\u00e9 working and I was like are they going to think that I\u2019m doing something wrong. And then I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">like well, I told her I didn\u2019t know if it was right, and I think I\u2019m just worried about just\u2026 I mean what people would perceive. I mean it feels kind of, I guess, what is it, the Truman show, where there\u2019s video cameras. And I don\u2019t know why I feel like that when just sort of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You feel like you\u2019re being watched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean part of it is\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t know why, I just sort of\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve always sort of\u2026 it\u2019s sort of like when I put things in the mail and I sort of freak out when I mail things. Did I really say everything? I mean I sort of freak out over what I just put in the mailbox and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">don\u2019t know why. I mean I guess because my\u2026 I have a lot of random thoughts. And especially when I had thoughts about HIV, and I worry that maybe I put something down, some of these random thoughts, and I didn\u2019t catch it. [7:59] And I had that, and I guess it\u2019s sort of something I had that when I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">very anxious about disease and HIV, and I don\u2019t think it ever went away. So I still fear. And when I\u2019m writing the letter I just sort of freak out about possibly putting something about\u2026 not HIV but just\u2026 I mean at this point it\u2019s still just a freak out. I mean I don\u2019t even know what I would put, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200213\">it\u2019s just a freak out and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20020-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20020-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561911\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: How long does the freak out last?

For letters it goes away for the most part just after\u2026 because it\u2019s\u2026 maybe after a few hours. So I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s an uncomfortable few hours. [9:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I guess I never\u2026 I mean I don\u2019t\u2026 I haven\u2019t brought this up, I guess, because I\u2026 it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, it was always just a problem that I\u2019ve sort of been okay with up until Jeremy was getting on my case for\u2026 because I don\u2019t mail things. And he\u2019ll be like okay, can you just put this <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200291\">in the mail. And for some reason, I mean it could be because there\u2019s not a mailbox right out our door. I mean you have to walk down a bit or\u2026 but I mean there\u2019s\u2026 eventually I\u2019ll walk by a mailbox or\u2026 to mail important things and I don\u2019t do it. And Jeremy was like\u2026 he\u2019s getting very sulky or oh, you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200292\">really bad at this. And I\u2019m like well that\u2019s not very nice and he\u2019s like well you are. And I\u2019m just like well I am. I just have a hard time mailing things. And then I explain and he\u2019s like oh, well do you want me to mail everything then and I was like well no. I was like because that\u2019s just sort of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200293\">letting me get away with the behavior, I said. [10:21] And I need to learn how to mail because I feel [inaudible] not to be able to put something in the mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: So you feel worried even when it\u2019s not a letter you\u2019ve written? So if he\u2019s put together a package or written a letter that you would feel anxious putting that in the mail as well as something that you\u2019ve done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yes, actually, I do. And I don\u2019t know why. I mean\u2026 and for one it\u2019s like did it actually go in the mailbox. But then it\u2019s\u2026 I sort of feel like I\u2019m leaving something behind or\u2026 and the idea of leaving something behind may be, I don\u2019t know. And see, that\u2019s where it just makes no sort of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: What is the worry? You\u2019re leaving it behind and what\u2019s the worry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: It could\u2026 I feel like it could have\u2026 for some reason it feels like I\u2019m leaving behind a piece, like if I left it behind and someone opened it it could be that oh, maybe they\u2019re going to open it up and take a check, or maybe I feel like there\u2019s something written about me, even though it could <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">just be a wedding thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: So it feels exposing, that someone might read something about you or learn something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. That\u2019s what it does. And I\u2026 yeah, it does sort of\u2026 I mean that\u2019s\u2026 I mean I guess it\u2019s not a very logical fear because I mean even if it\u2019s a deposit fee for the wedding cake or a deposit\u2026 I mean even with those\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel fear when about thinking about mailing them, I just didn\u2019t mail <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">them. [12:20] And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: What did you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I just kept them in my backpack, even though there\u2019s a mailbox as I\u2019m leaving the physics department and there\u2019s mailboxes all over when you walk around the Square. And I just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: So it\u2026 the fear\u2019s really interfering because you need to pay those deposits to hold your vendors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: So it\u2026 I mean there\u2019s\u2026 at some points in life maybe it might not interfere so much, but right now is a time when you sort of need to be using the mail service for these kinds of things. So it is\u2026 when I think about whether or not a behavior is a problem or not, using the marker is it getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">in the way with what you need to do and sort of\u2026 to fulfill your daily life obligations. And right now this is because yeah, if you don\u2019t pay your deposits then your vendors, yeah, don\u2019t feel beholden to the contract. And if it\u2019s hard to get those envelopes in the mail then that becomes a problem.

I mean there\u2019s\u2026 and with the mail thing, as you say, it has nothing really to do with me, but in the same sense I feel like if I left it behind it still feels like there\u2019s something about me in that message.

I\u2019m either\u2026 and I guess that\u2019s the sort of thing, is I spent a long time hiding these thoughts.

I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 and it\u2019s just a lot like fearing I said something to people and it\u2019s\u2026 said something inappropriate or wrong. I have that same fear with people. I don\u2019t know, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">some reason it\u2019s\u2026 it reminds me of back in the day when I was really worried about germs, and I got my blood drawn and I\u2019d be like dad\u2026 or I called up my dad and I was like I don\u2019t know if I put my hand in the used needle container.

These things just don\u2019t happen and you forget about them. And I think that\u2019s the thing is because I\u2019m trying to deal with a\u2026 I mean I\u2019d cut my antidepressant [inaudible] but it\u2019s\u2026 I think the regular dose is 20 mcgs or\u2026 20 or 30, which I was on for a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200592\">while, and then I came down. And it\u2019s\u2026 I mean I\u2026 thoughts don\u2019t go away. I just have all of these sort of thoughts and it\u2019s hard to deal with them.

I found that actually I think I was\u2026 I think it was actually what\u2026 it didn\u2019t work like I thought, and then I realized it might be maybe my views on sex are\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: More so than meds?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I\u2019m still a little afraid of it and sort of my role in feeling sexy. I mean it\u2019s been a long time that I wanted to feel sexy and I think I\u2019m getting\u2026 I\u2019m feeling more and more comfortable about feeling sexy. And as far as\u2026 it reminded me, watching The Wolf of Wall Street, where <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200651\">it\u2019s very\u2026 they have lots of scenes that are very graphic, and to be okay with the sort of curiosity and the interest of sex. And I think that was another thing that I sort of\u2026 I still sort of feel bad for getting those thoughts or thinking about those. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: So watching that movie, did you feel like that gave you permission, sort of normalized it for you?

Wow, that is a\u2026 I mean there is of course the drama, the grandioseness, the prevalence\u2026 a lot of it, I mean it was a little\u2026 it was over the top, to say the least, but in the sense\u2026 just seeing men and women together and enjoying it. And it in a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">sense it didn\u2019t fully renormalize but it sort of reminded me how come I don\u2019t feel that way or how come\u2026 so it got me thinking and then I realized that don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think of myself as sexy or I don\u2019t even know what sexy\u2026 to be sexy means anymore. [21:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Was there a time when you felt like you did know what that meant for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Maybe when I first\u2026 when I was younger. When I was younger, yes, and had my first boyfriend. And then even in the beginning with my second boyfriend, which is now my ex-boyfriend, I mean things were exciting and new and\u2026 but I think after the breakup and worrying about the germs and having a <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">few hookups, I\u2026 actually two, but I mean I didn\u2019t feel sexy then; I felt scared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: A very different feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think, yeah, I was\u2026 it was sort of tied with\u2026 I mean during my\u2026 with my ex-boyfriend I did enjoy sex and I was able to have a libido and to orgasm and\u2026 but starting\u2026 after that sort of broke up I was afraid to feel sexy or afraid to do anything that involved that. I mean in one sense <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">I was afraid that I had something but I guess in another sense I was just\u2026 it\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026 the interest of being sexy or wanting to be sexy or viewed as sexy\u2026 I mean pretty, yes, but not sexy, not hot, not\u2026 and I sort of feel that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561911\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">THERAPIST: Because the sex felt dangerous, because you might give something to someone or you might catch something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">CLIENT: It made me sad. It\u2026 well in a sense it felt very dangerous but it also felt sad, like loveless. And that\u2019s\u2026 it might be because right before my second boyfriend broke up he had sex with me, and same with the guy I was sort of dating during the summer that was in between the two. [23:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: So you sort of connected sex with being left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, I really\u2026 I think that. And also, yeah, I mean that was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And danger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And\u2026 well it didn\u2019t help\u2026 well I don\u2019t know, it didn\u2019t\u2026 back when I\u2026 my parents found out that I was having sex with my ex-boyfriend, my mom and sister called me a slut, and that\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you were really ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: I\u2026 yeah, I mean I was, and in the same sense it didn\u2019t stop me. I still enjoyed it. But once I broke\u2026 or once my ex-boyfriend broke up with me he\u2026 I sort of saw that as that\u2026 those years that I spent with him, the things that I did with him, were all wrong and bad and I did\u2026 after he broke up <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200811\">with me I wrote a long\u2026 a whole list of things that he should apologize for. Of course he didn\u2019t apologize for anything. Instead he made me feel bad for worrying and\u2026 or being upset about that and said that I was the bad one. Anyway, but part of\u2026 on that list I said that I was like why did you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200812\">sex with me if you knew it wasn\u2019t\u2026 if it\u2026 if you were going to break up with me. And he\u2019s like well he\u2019s like I don\u2019t know. And he\u2019s like it feels good or I was excited to see you after my trip. And that, I mean, and I guess with the\u2026 I guess\u2026 and following\u2026 after that sex, not only was it kind of sad, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200813\">it was just sort of a feeling of\u2026 it was sad because it seemed to be\u2026 I felt used, especially right the next day. I felt very used. [26:05] And following, I know that when Jeremy and I were first getting intimate he said I made a\u2026 he said I looked strange when I was being intimate, my face. He\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200814\">it looks like you\u2019re in pain. It\u2019s like\u2026 and I feel like I\u2019m molesting you. And after that Jeremy and I really didn\u2019t try sex for another\u2026 for a long while. I don\u2019t know, just because I was just\u2026 I felt really embarrassed. And not to\u2026 I guess I felt really embarrassed, just sort of like my first\u2026 I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200815\">felt that I was being brave even though at that time I was still germophobic. And I thought that it would bring me the same happiness, but then when he said that I looked strange then I was\u2026 I just\u2026 it was\u2026 I guess there\u2019s a bunch of things that are revolving around me and sex. And I mean I know that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200816\">I enjoyed it when I was younger, or at least with my ex-boyfriend I\u2026 but then it\u2026 in the end it just sort of\u2026 it felt sad after that, and dangerous. And then I felt just really embarrassed when I was with Jeremy. [27:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: How does it feel now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: It\u2019s getting a little bit better now that he\u2019s sort of taking on to cues and that I\u2019m trying to tell him things that I like. And I think especially now, after I watched that video, I just\u2026 I was\u2026 it sort of piqued my interest into trying and\u2026 being more open and trying to feel sexy. And part <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">of that is\u2026 part of the things of getting excited about it are things that might make me feel sexy, like maybe a tight short or just a certain je ne sais quoi as I\u2026 when I\u2019m around Jeremy or\u2026 and it was actually funny because on Friday when I was feeling in the mood and he was tired or he didn\u2019t feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200852\">good and I was like what the heck, I was like normally you always get on my case for not wanting\u2026 or not being in the mood. And that\u2019s part of it, I feel guilty that I don\u2019t have a high sex drive. And so I guess I had feelings of guilt as well. I think this is\u2026 it\u2019s sort of a catch-22 or, I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200853\">like if you feel guilty, feeling guilty about not doing something, you would think that you could easily do something, but then I just sort of feel embarrassed rather than\u2026 I mean I guess it\u2019s really a loaded subject for me, and I think\u2026 I mean I think I need to really\u2026 because I told my mom about it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200854\">and she\u2019s like you know, this reminds me of this\u2026 she actually was telling this lady that\u2026 because this lady had at one time liked sex but then just sort of lost her sex drive. [29:40] And she said\u2026 gave the woman advice, whenever you have a hobby, what do you do about it. You think about it. You dream <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200855\">about it. You arrange your life so that\u2026 I mean say it\u2019s with knitting, then I would look at yarns and caress them and think about the colors and the varieties and the possibilities. And she\u2019s like well, then you need to start doing that with sex, start thinking about it. Start thinking about ideas, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200856\">getting these thoughts in your head and being excited about it. And then I realized\u2026 at that point I was like wow, I don\u2019t really think about sex. I think the only time I think about it is how can I avoid it. And that sounds horrible but I mean\u2026 and I thought it was because of my antidepressant because <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200857\">that\u2019s when but I sort of realized that maybe it\u2019s something more than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561911\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">THERAPIST: Because I think\u2026 and it may have had an exacerbating sort of component. The antidepressant can dampen your sexual urges but it doesn\u2019t create meaning about what sex means or what it means about you to have certain feelings about sex. [30:57] And it sounds like part of what is getting in your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200871\">way from sex being enjoyable is sort of the meaning that you construct around sex and the meaning that you attach. What does it mean about you if you want it or don\u2019t want it or want certain things and not other things. The medication doesn\u2019t have that power. It can certainly make it hard to orgasm, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200872\">which can make sex not really that interesting, and it can decrease just the general feelings of libido, which make you kind of want to be sexually active at all. But it certainly doesn\u2019t create the feelings of guilt or discomfort, kind of vulnerability that you\u2019ve been talking about, in a sense. Those <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200873\">are much more about the meaning that you attach to sex, the messages that you\u2019ve kind of absorbed about it, whether it be from your family or your upbringing or society in general. And your past experiences. I mean it sounds like you had some experiences with partners that were negative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. And what\u2019s a way to, I mean, sort of, I guess, detach the meanings or create new meanings or\u2026 and what\u2026 I mean do you have any advice on suggestions on how I should go about thinking positively or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20088-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20088-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561911\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Well what do you want sex to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008D\">CLIENT: Well\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What would you teach your daughter? [32:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20091\">CLIENT: It should be\u2026 well one thing is funny because Kitty tells me, she\u2019s dating this new guy and she tells me very vividly about her sex life, how\u2026 or not vividly but vividly\u2026 more vividly than you think your mother in law would talk about it, how it\u2019s fun and exciting and just an expression of feeling. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">And I want it to be like that. I want it to be fun and to laugh and enjoy and to have that component of feeling close. And at this point I\u2019m still\u2026 I mean I think now I\u2019ve been trying to sort of\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: What does feel fun, exciting, and emotionally close?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: I know definitely rubbing of the back and the hugging and kissing and being physically close.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20097\">THERAPIST: So at what point does it change from that to something different? When do you\u2026 when in sexual play do you lose that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">CLIENT: When it starts to be like I\u2019m\u2026 when it\u2026 I think it\u2019s when it starts to become instead of just being close and getting excited, when sort of Jeremy sort of starts to expect\u2026 he starts going\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009B\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s nothing that I haven\u2019t heard before. [34:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009D\">CLIENT: Okay. I\u2026 it feels like he expects me to either\u2026 I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m\u2026 because when he goes to put on protection and then we\u2019re about to have sex. And then I\u2019m like oh shoot, I\u2019m not ready to come, and he\u2019s going to come and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Is there an expectation that you\u2019re going to come together?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">CLIENT: For him? Yeah. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">THERAPIST: So\u2026 and he\u2019s expecting you to come through intercourse?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Okay, so we need to dispel him of this notion because that\u2026 it\u2019s rare, and I think it sounds like that\u2019s a rough expectation for you to try to meet. And it also sounds like he moves toward intercourse before you\u2019re really ready. So there\u2019s two things, if you can talk about this with him. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A71\">Most women don\u2019t come through penetration because it\u2019s not how your body is made. Most women. I mean there are a few women that\u2026 for whom\u2026 how their bodies are aligned that penetration might lead to orgasm. But for most women the thing that\u2019s actually going to lead you to orgasm is clitoral stimulation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A72\">And your clitoris is not near where the opening of your vagina is. So actual intercourse, not necessarily what\u2019s going to be most efficient, if even possible, for you to come to orgasm. And if the expectation is that you\u2019re going to come together, my guess is that the expectation is that he\u2019s probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A73\">going to come through vaginal intercourse. And then you\u2019re just going to magically do that? So trying to dispel that. And a lot of times\u2026 flip through some Cosmos or Glamour or any of those because a lot of times they\u2019ll have articles written in easy language. [36:12] It doesn\u2019t have to be a clinical <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A74\">discussion that kind of says this is not actually what\u2019s going to work. What usually works is direct clitoral stimulation, whether that be using his fingers or use fingers or a vibrator during intercourse, maybe, if that\u2019s really important or\u2026 before or after. That\u2019s going to be a lot\u2026 much more realistic <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A75\">in terms of just how your body works.

Maybe we do need to flip through some Cosmos because I mean I guess I\u2019ve been really embarrassed because that\u2019s\u2026 in the past there was a focus on exciting through the clitoris, and doing that before so I was just about to have an orgasm and then go from there. And it\u2026 and I guess, for <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B11\">some reason, I feel I haven\u2019t done that with Jeremy because I let him take the lead. And I think I just need to be\u2026 talk to him about it, that I need more time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and you need\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t expect him to orgasm by rubbing his leg, right. So it doesn\u2019t make any sense to expect you to orgasm by rubbing a part of your body that\u2019s not actually an erogenous zone. [37:52] Intercourse is fabulously designed for pregnancy, right. It gets a man to ejaculate, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B31\">which is what you need for women to get pregnant. So that works really well for him. Nobody really knows exactly why women have orgasms because it\u2019s not\u2026 it may be to get us interested in having sex so we can procreate. But if you\u2019re not having sex just for the purpose of procreation, which you\u2019re not, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B32\">then it\u2019s important that you get to enjoy it. And it\u2019s\u2026 the intercourse part is just for pregnancy, and obviously you\u2019re trying to prevent that. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you necessarily want to prevent the other fun parts. So I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. There is something wrong with the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B33\">way that the media portrays sex, and that\u2019s where this idea, right, because in a lot of movies oh, they have intercourse and everybody\u2019s ecstatic. And they\u2019re missing\u2026 they\u2019re not showing other things that are going on. And yeah, in order to get you to orgasm he\u2019s got to stimulate your clitoris. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B34\">unless\u2026 that\u2019s not necessarily what\u2019s getting stimulated when you\u2019re having intercourse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B5\">CLIENT: Well that makes me feel a lot better because I think that I was just really embarrassed, and I think\u2026 because yeah, I do see the movies where the magic happens and it\u2019s like how does that happen. And I mean I don\u2019t ask my sister about these things. I mean especially because now she has hip problems. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B51\">That\u2019s a very sensitive subject for her because she\u2026 I mean sometimes she tells me more but then my ears start to shut up because\u2026 and I don\u2019t really talk to my friends about it. [39:37] And maybe I should just, to\u2026 so I can see what works for them, or maybe read some magazines and see what\u2026 I mean <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200B52\">because I\u2019ve always been really embarrassed to read about sex. And I think that might go along with the why sex is such a loaded topic for me. And I think it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B7\">THERAPIST: It just felt like you weren\u2019t working correctly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I think the message that\u2019s sent about sex is still quite\u2026 it\u2019s heterosexist and it\u2019s male\u2026 it\u2019s in a male dominated view. Even when we look at our sort of\u2026 the medical literature, the stuff that we know about what makes the male body work and the stuff we know about the female body is\u2026 it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB1\">not equal. Do you have cable?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561911\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BD\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200BF\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a\u2026 there\u2019s actually a series. I don\u2019t know if you can stream it or not\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C1\">CLIENT: Maybe I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C3\">THERAPIST: \u2026called\u2026 I think it\u2019s called Masters and Johnson, or it\u2019s something to that effect. And it\u2019s a fictionalized account of real life, so it\u2019s somewhat nonfiction. But Masters and Johnson were these two researchers who did sort of the groundbreaking research on the physiology of orgasm and sex. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C31\">And nobody had ever wanted to touch it before because medical science thought ooh, this is not like real science. But it\u2019s how the body works. So they did\u2026 their research was a little questionable, and their methods, because they couldn\u2019t get anybody to fund it, so they did a lot of research on themselves, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C32\">and they hired prostitutes to work for them. But they did this groundbreaking research on looking at what are the phases of excitement, and they focused a lot on women because we knew some stuff about men. [41:29] But looking at the phases of what actually gets people excited, what works in orgasm, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C33\">how does this help. So if you can Hulu that you might find that it\u2019s engaging to watch because they\u2019ve made it into sort of a drama. But it\u2019s real life information about how does the female body work, what is an orgasm, what actually gets women excited. And so you\u2026 it might\u2026 in the privacy of your own <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C34\">home you might feel like you can check it out. Or yeah, let yourself pick up a Cosmo and go to the love and sex section and read what\u2026 read some stuff that just lets you feel a little bit more comfortable with the whole topic. I don\u2019t\u2026 it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re abnormal; it sounds like the expectation <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C35\">is abnormal and misguided. Just present\u2026 you got presented with a lot of information that was incorrect and didn\u2019t have anything to\u2026 didn\u2019t have access to information that would help you kind of break the myth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think\u2026 I mean it\u2019s interesting because Jeremy and I, we don\u2019t talk about sex, and I think it sounds like he\u2026 I mean he said originally he likes to do it because\u2026 he doesn\u2019t talk to sex about\u2026 with his friends because he likes to keep the intimacy between the couple. But think about\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C51\">we don\u2019t really talk about it or like even [inaudible] if anything it\u2019s sort of a joke, or he\u2019ll be like\u2026 he\u2019s like will you pleasure me. And he sort of looks at me. Jeremy, you can\u2019t ask like that. We always just sort of laugh. He\u2019s like but it\u2019s so funny when I say it like that. I think he\u2019s slightly <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C52\">uncomfortable talking about it, very sensitive, because\u2026 and I think that\u2019s the thing is that he and I need to become more comfortable with each other about it. [43:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Well I\u2019m happy to talk about this stuff in here with you, and if we can find a language that feels more comfortable and you can start to bring it up with him. And if you guys can\u2019t talk about it then it\u2019s really hard to approach it and change what\u2019s going on. And I think the end goal is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200C71\">you do feel comfortable talking about sex, having sex, and that it\u2019s enjoyable for both of you. But yeah, there\u2019s some steps. I want to look\u2026 I used to teach a sex ed course so I\u2019m wondering if I still have any of my stuff, or where I have it. Yeah, so let me\u2026 are we meeting next week?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561911\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200C9\">CLIENT: I think so, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CB\">THERAPIST: So let me spend some time\u2026 I will\u2026 I know there\u2019s some good sort of basic info and that way you can present it to him in sort of a nonbiased way. It\u2019s not here. It\u2019s not like you telling him. If we can find some stuff that feels objective and won\u2019t feel like a personal threat and you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200CB1\">kind of share it. So let me find some time looking through here, find you some stuff, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CD\">CLIENT: That would be great because I think him and I both need to open up the dialogue and be comfortable talking about it rather than just\u2026 it seems sort of like a\u2026 more like a guilt trip when he talks about it, like oh, why don\u2019t you do this and oh, he gives me a frowny face. Because he was feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200CD1\">very revved up right before we went on a walk and I was like well, I kind of want to go on the walk. And he\u2019s just like what, you don\u2019t\u2026 he\u2019s like you\u2019re making me feel dejected. And I was like well, I was like\u2026 and in a sense I mean I wanted to go for the walk, but I also didn\u2019t want to\u2026 I mean I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200CF\">THERAPIST: You were avoiding. [45:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was avoiding. So\u2026 but yeah, no, that would be really helpful because\u2026 I think because I haven\u2019t\u2026 in talking, I feel very uncomfortable talking about sex in general, and I think talking it in this room will help, and with the controlled setting feel like it\u2019s something really positive <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200D11\">to do. And I think that part of getting married is being able to enjoy this with your partner, and I think at this point it\u2019s something that I still need to work on because at this point I don\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s not something that\u2019s fun. I mean it\u2019s fun a little bit fun but it\u2019s not something that brings me back. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200D12\">Eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch seems a little bit more fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D3\">THERAPIST: So I think\u2026 I\u2019d love to get you to a place where sex trumps Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Not eliminates it, but trumps it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think it should, as good as everyone seems to talk about it. There must be something to it. It\u2019s not mentioned in most magazines or\u2026 Cinnamon Toast Crunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200D7\">THERAPIST: All right. Well why don\u2019t we stop there for today.
