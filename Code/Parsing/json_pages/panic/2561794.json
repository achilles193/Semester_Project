Hello Jessa. Due to my being away at a conference last week there\u2019s been a longer interval of time between our previous session and this one. And I noted down before I left for my conference, and after our last session, the homework. So I\u2019ll just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">mention that and then hear whether you did it, how you did it, and anything else. Just to recap, one of the areas that we were looking at last time was that of your mother\u2019s behavior and tendencies and how you shared she displays behavior after which you feel guilt, and talking about the helpfulness <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">of your developing less need for approval. [00:01:02.22] When we talked about it in the last session, you were able to see the humor in the situation. And homework included your reflecting on unconditional self-acceptance and identifying the thoughts that are counter to your attaining more of that unconditional <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">acceptance within yourself, and the importance of disputing irrational beliefs. I recommended, and you agreed, that you might write down the E\u2019s, the effective new philosophies, and read them every day and do some full and complete ABCDE forms. So that\u2019s where we left off. Please fill me in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Well in a perfect world...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Where\u2019s that? Which universe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I know, it\u2019s an imperfect world. But in a perfect world I would\u2019ve been able to probably get, maybe, some more of the homework done \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Keep talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: And completed. [00:02:02.05] Unfortunately so after you left we I had one really good night where I was really feeling great, and I wrote myself a letter which using the dear Jessa form, which I can share or not share, whatever. But sort of using the rational beliefs or techniques or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">Then after that I had two really, really challenging weeks, pain management wise, where I would go to work and all I was capable of doing once I got home was just \u2013 all I was physically capable of doing was lying down, putting on some ice or some heat, and really calling it a night. And I had some really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">painful moments in there because I really was almost unable to even do my regular work for work let alone anything any kind of extra. [00:03:01.08] So fortunately I don\u2019t really want to focus on that because fortunately today, I don\u2019t know what it was, maybe it was just you connected some miracle, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">you being connected, but today was the first day that I actually was able to get through a whole day of work and not even be I mean I had some physical pain at different points but it was not debilitating, and I was able to get through the day. And I took an acetaminophen and was able to just feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">like I could do some stuff. So when I got home today before seeing you I had some time and was able to actually write down some things because up until today it\u2019s been quite challenging. And part of one of the things it\u2019s interesting because one of the things I was writing while I was waiting for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200175\">you to come was about how I wasn\u2019t able to do any of the work. Not that I haven\u2019t been doing it in my head because that\u2019s the thing. I\u2019ve really been thinking a lot, catching myself, doing all of that, but the actual work for that we talk about, the I guess the written down part, that\u2019s been a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200176\">bit more of a challenge just because I haven\u2019t really been able to write. [00:04:10.26]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: And not only for the last two weeks, but in the course of our sessions it\u2019s been an interesting observation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been months. So I had some moments where I got really angry, really frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: You mean you got yourself really angry and frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: By telling yourself what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: By telling myself that I can\u2019t I couldn\u2019t stand well the pain, that I couldn\u2019t stand it. That I couldn\u2019t stand the pain, that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. And then one evening I said, okay, well there are things that you can do to get rid of the pain because I wasn\u2019t really taking any pain <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200231\">medication. So then I took pain medication and then I got nauseous because it was like a Percocet, and it was really heavy medication. So then I told myself, you can\u2019t even take a pain medication and get better. And so nothing is going to work. [00:05:00.08] And so it was I kind of spiraled out of control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: After telling yourself that nothing is going to work, did you add something to that thought in all probability?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: \u201cAs it should\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: As it should work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: As it should, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: And might you have added that \u201cIt\u2019s awful that it...\u201d?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s awful that it doesn\u2019t, yeah, that it isn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: That may be a way you may think in other undesirable circumstances \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: And I was able to at least the good news is that I was able to at least catch myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: That is good news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was able to catch myself, but it wasn\u2019t until after. When I was in those moments where the pain was so super intense, like I can\u2019t even describe to somebody that doesn\u2019t have a herniated disc and recovering from major shoulder surgery. You can\u2019t really describe it to anybody but it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">to me it felt unbearable. And so it wasn\u2019t until after that sort of pain had gone a little bit, subsided a little bit, that I was able to recognize some of the things I was telling myself. So I think it was a little bit of two things going on because yes, I do tell myself these things, and I\u2019m very <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">much aware of it and I did write it, a lot of what I tell myself down and tried to work out how to make it a little more logical, but then I guess the question lies on the table of when pain doesn\u2019t last forever. [00:06:10.08] And I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Nothing lasts forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well nothing lasts forever, they say, except death and taxes. But I don\u2019t know. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Some people might disagree with that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Some people might disagree. I actually disagree with that because I don\u2019t think that does either. But nevertheless, in those moments of intense physical pain that is really, really difficult for me to even describe, it is very difficult to come out, at least for myself. That\u2019s my own experience, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">is that in a physical pain state it doesn\u2019t make it any better to think in this should, must type of illogical or not rational way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Pain can make it more difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: It can make it worse. But I feel like it\u2019s a slippery slope because it\u2019s like what comes first, sometimes in those moments when it\u2019s I couldn\u2019t I really was blinded by pain. [00:07:05.13] That\u2019s how I felt and I\u2019m not like that today, so I know there\u2019s a difference between...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: It can be helpful to make the distinction between thinking that \u201cI feel blinded by the pain and debilitated\u201d which may simply be a description, and \u201cI can\u2019t stand that I\u2019m blinded by the pain and debilitated\u201d, which really is weakening. One may allow soldiering on, keeping on with breathing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">taking a tablet, but you\u2019re not adding to the discomfort by then forecasting the worst \u2013 that \u201cI can\u2019t stand it\u201d. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: I think I lost you only because you said taking a tablet but then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Doing something, taking some action, if you can, to help lessen the physical pain. So when you\u2019re honestly in pain and it\u2019s blinding and you do not have the energy to pick up a pen and do your ABCs, that\u2019s quite understandable. [00:08:03.15] But then if you add to that, and say or imply that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">\u201cthis is shocking and I can\u2019t stand it and it\u2019s awful\u201d that disempowers you even more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. No, and I get that. I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: And so the beauty of doing this...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I can see it later on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yes, and the beauty of doing this REBT work, and keeping on doing it and doing it and doing it, especially on the more comfortable days, is that it makes it easier if there\u2019s a really challenging day again to not catastrophize, to breathe, to sweat, to handle the pain and not add to it by <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">saying this is awful and terrible. You see? So part of what I hope these sessions are offering you is the motivation to keep making effort to get into this healthy way of thinking habitually. [00:09:02.27] And that comes only through practice, practice. And the good news is that you told me a few minutes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">ago you\u2019re watching your thinking catching yourself when you think in unhelpful ways more. Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I am catching myself. And so what I ended up doing one of the evenings when it was because it\u2019s been it wasn\u2019t just one evening. It had been like that. It kind of hit an all-time high, and I think maybe because I was getting treatments, and so sometimes you have to go through the really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">bad part when you\u2019re getting the treatment in order for there to be some type of a rainbow at the end. But basically what I did at the time was I started looking up different, what\u2019s it called, I can\u2019t even think of what it\u2019s called, specialists in herniated discs and really so trying to empower myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">that way. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You felt less hopeless and less disempowered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Right. So I had hope throughout all of it. So I guess, again, there were some really good things. I think just in terms of doing the actual written homework, that was where it was a little bit more of a challenge, only based on the fact that writing was a challenge, actually putting...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Do you write at work? [00:10:10.10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: All the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Okay, then you still can write.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: No, I wasn\u2019t able to do it at work either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Oh, you weren\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: No. No. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I was just investigating whether there\u2019s any selective extra effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: No, there really is not, actually. In fact, when I called the doctor\u2019s office to find out if my pain was sort of to be expected based on what I the surgery that I had had done and what had happened there after, which was the herniated disc, the nurse actually told me that she\u2019s very impressed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">Most of the people that call that call her to say, is this normal because they all get this after the surgery, she said they\u2019re either kind of doped up on some type of pain medication so they don\u2019t really feel it, that they just want to know when the pain medication\u2019s going when they don\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200672\">to take it anymore, or she said, they\u2019ll be calling and saying, I need a letter for work because I cannot go back. And she said, in fact, I just got off the phone with somebody who is not who hasn\u2019t been going to work. So I guess in a way I wanted to kind of pat myself on the back in the sense that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200673\">I\u2019ve been able to that I have pushed conjured up something, whatever energy I have, to go to work. [00:11:19.12] And then when I\u2019ve come home it\u2019s been that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I had had for two weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: And also you\u2019ve just, in the last few minutes, reported to me that you\u2019re more aware, you catch yourself more. So that\u2019s good. Have you noticed any changes in attitude to yourself regarding having greater unconditional acceptance of yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Certain ways, yes. I still that\u2019s an area where I definitely need to continue to work on because I think what happens for me is it\u2019s and I think I\u2019m sure this is for a lot of people, not just me, but I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Why are we bringing in other people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, because I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s pause there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Okay, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Because it reminds me of what you\u2019ve told me in the past of in the past, your tendency to even lose sleep...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: To compare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Compare and wondering did you do the right thing. [00:12:16.12] So I just wanted to put the spotlight on this tendency of yours ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: No, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: ...a seemingly habitual tendency to bring others into the picture when I\u2019m simply asking about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: About me. Well I think it\u2019s embarr I feel shameful. I feel ashamed over the fact that I beat myself up. I don\u2019t even I wasn\u2019t even aware, I don\u2019t think, until I started this REBT work of how negatively I speak to myself. And so it is that part for me, personally, has been challenging to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">change because I feel like it doesn\u2019t even feel natural when I tell myself. I\u2019m almost like ha, ha, ha, that\u2019s not what I to me it\u2019s not resonating yet. That\u2019s just what I sort of about me. The part let\u2019s separate it for a minute. I can do all the other stuff but then when it comes to actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F2\">being accepting of myself and not being super hard on myself, or not beating myself up about whatever it is, that part continues to be challenging as much as I attempt to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Okay, so pause, breathe, why do you think that is? Let\u2019s explore this. [00:13:24.09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: I believe I know the answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Well it has to do with past stuff. I don\u2019t want to focus so much on the past but it does I believe it comes from that. I think it\u2019s beliefs that for however x number of years when I don\u2019t think we\u2019re always so much aware of what we\u2019re told and then how we internalize it, in other words, about <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">ourselves. So I don\u2019t really think I realized it so much before our working together because it was maybe a little more subtle. I didn\u2019t have conscious ...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: You mean it was subconscious?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Subconscious, yeah, so I think that this whole REBT practice has enlightened me to maybe realizing how I think and how I feel and how I act and behave because of it. [00:14:12.28] But at the same time it has been daunting in the sense that I didn\u2019t even know that I did. And I continue to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">back to that because it\u2019s only been a few weeks of this and my whole life of doing that. So it\u2019s very unfamiliar...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Which may explain, to go back to my question just now, why you think it\u2019s so unfamiliar. Because it IS unfamiliar!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really unfamiliar to me. It\u2019s really unfamiliar to the point where I feel ashamed that I\u2019m like and I know that\u2019s again, and it comes up. But I do. I feel ashamed that it\u2019s that unfamiliar. It just seems like it should...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see, so you are telling me that you \u201cshould have\u201d been able to psychically pick up the formula of REBT before we even had these sessions?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: No. I think it\u2019s self-esteem though. I think that\u2019s what it is. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily REBT. I think it\u2019s how you feel about yourself. [00:15:04.28] So somebody might not have had REBT practices but they might\u2019ve felt a certain way about themselves. And then if they got REBT I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200931\">know. I don\u2019t want to talk about somebody else. For me it feels like it\u2019s a...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Good, there\u2019s progress. Just speaking of you, not someone else \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: For me I feel like it\u2019s self-esteem related. That my self-esteem is that much in the gutter that it\u2019s pretty frightening to know that\u2019s so I think when I look at it sometimes, or I have to look at it, and again, it had nothing to do with the writing piece because I was happy to write when <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200971\">I had a good day before you left. So it\u2019s not that. What it is, is in my mind. When I go there in my head I catch myself but then I\u2019ve been thinking, thinking, thinking about the shoulds, the but it\u2019s much more natural to think in that way. It\u2019s my tendency...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: Familiar tendency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Familiar, yeah. So I could definitely use some help in how to make it more familiar to have Unconditional acceptance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Unconditional self-acceptance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: Because I don\u2019t want to sit here and act as though that part every time I get to that part, that\u2019s where...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Which part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: The part the unconditional self-acceptance piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: And you seem reluctant to change \u2013 and seem to tend to interchange the expression unconditional self-acceptance with self-esteem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT Aren\u2019t they kind of the same?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">THERAPIST: They are not the same, although I think a huge majority of people considering those areas think they are the same. My husband (Albert Ellis) wrote a book on that, and I helped him work on that book, did research for it, that was published in 2005 called The Myth of Self Esteem the publisher <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">chose that title because the publisher can make that choice, but Al actually wanted to call it Why Self Esteem is a Sickness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a sickness? Why it\u2019s a sickness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Sickness, yes. [00:17:10.22] And he would sometimes say, in talks, self-esteem is the greatest sickness known to humankind because according to the commonly understood definition of it, which may or not be yours Jessa, is that a person may think: \u201cI esteem myself, I consider myself worthwhile <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B11\">because I\u2019m adequate at this and I\u2019m good at that and because, because, because\u2026\u201d. A lot of well-meaning counselors and teachers will talk about raising your self-esteem, focus on what you do well. And to put it in my husband\u2019s language, if you think you\u2019re worthwhile because you\u2019re good at this, this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B12\">and that, well then if in the course of life you become less good or become bad at this, this, or that, thento quote him back to shithood you go. So USA and REBT strongly are about encouraging us to realize, to accept ourselves unconditionally, to work on that healthy accepting that we have worth <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B13\">simply because we are alive \u2013 not due to what we do well at or due to what we have. And this is very much pointed at you right now, that each one of us has worth just because we\u2019re alive. [00:18:23.29] And if we do well at things and if we\u2019re fortunate enough to have talents, certainly let\u2019s enjoy the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B14\">talents, but let\u2019s work on not letting the talents define us. We have worth because we exist \u2013 we are not what we do or defined by it \u2013 what we do is simply that: what we do. It is not who we are. And we you and I spoke about this when it came to your decades of working out and fitness training.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: Oh, I thought you were going to say the piano thing [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And that too. But I remember, also, that part of the frustration you were feeling, or worse, about the pain and injuries that you\u2019re coping with now, was the fact that you can\u2019t train as freely, as much, as often, in the same way as you used to, and you agreed in some sessions past that in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">your mind that activity had defined you for a while. [00:19:10.02] And I was hoping to have you contemplate the fact that while that\u2019s something you do and like to do, and good on you for that \u2013 it is a healthy activity, but maybe in 75 years you won\u2019t be able to do as much at the gym. And if you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">that you\u2019re more you because you\u2019re so good at the gym and if\/when you can\u2019t do it some day, then the danger is you feeling diminished instead of having the attitude \u2013 \u201cwell, I\u2019m now 105 years old, I can\u2019t do what I did when I was 35. I wish I could, but I can\u2019t and I can stand that and find other things to enjoy\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: At that age I\u2019d be tired though, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d be tired\u2026that could be. Do you understand however the point I am making?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: But I\u2019ve gotten better at that. I mean there has been I don\u2019t want to focus on the negative, I think, because I didn\u2019t have the actual I feel like it\u2019s like a presentation, so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an illogical thought that I oh, I have nothing really I have things in the notebook but not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">as much as we said. So that\u2019s where it comes back to. But really, in essence, there has been a lot of change with that because I don\u2019t I no longer life circumstances, I no longer define myself by that. I haven\u2019t been going to the gym as much and that hasn\u2019t been an option for me to be able to do <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB2\">what I was doing before. So clearly I\u2019ve gone on despite all of that. [00:20:14.22] I\u2019m not happy about it. I really, in a way, in fact I\u2019ve tried to kind of be happy about it because somebody said the other day oh, I would do anything not to have to go to the gym right now. I just enjoy it. I enjoy <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB3\">it. I think it\u2019s that. I felt like a pleasure that was being taken away in a sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Temporarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: Temporarily, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Okay, but I want to go...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: Sorry, did that make sense?

And even earlier this evening you had said that you\u2019re catching yourself, and that\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: I am. I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: But what I\u2019d right now like to look at is the comment you made about feeling ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: I do. [00:21:12.17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s what I\u2019m commenting on now. And I\u2019d like to ask you, what do you think you\u2019re telling yourself, specifically, to make yourself feel ashamed for not yet being habitual or an expert in the constant remembrance of REBT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Okay, well I did some stuff. And maybe it would be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Can you answer that question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Oh, oh, sure. I just had it right here in terms of all the things I was doing. So what am I telling myself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: To make yourself ashamed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Lots of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Well tell me what they are please.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, but do you want you want it in a specific like what comes first. There\u2019s so much. There\u2019s so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Chercher (look for) the shoulds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: The shoulds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: What are you telling yourself to make yourself ashamed? Now it would be quite healthy enough to feel disappointed if you had a goal and you didn\u2019t reach it. [00:22:13.24] You had the goal to have more USA and there you went, you put yourself down, oh you\u2019re disappointed. Wouldn\u2019t talk you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">out of that. It\u2019s nothing to be ecstatic about. But the shame is unhealthy \u2013 and far from disappointment it is debilitating. It keeps you imprisoned. What are you telling yourself to make yourself feel ashamed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E7\">CLIENT: That well I start with comparisons. Any other person that was doing REBT was getting a beautiful experience. Therapy like this for others would have gone much farther at this point. That\u2019s one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Okay, stop. Where is the evidence that any other person doing REBT would\u2019ve been much further at this point? And by the way, we\u2019re talking only months, not years.

[00:26:06.00] Number one, where is the evidence that after two whole weeks Debbie would be devastatingly disappointed at what you think is your dismal, so-called lack of progress? (And by the way we agreed a few minutes ago you have made progress). And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201211\">secondly, if Debbie was disappointed, what\u2019s the horror? What\u2019s the terribleness about that? Two questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: To the first to answer the first one, wait, what was the question for the first one? What\u2019s the evidence...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yes, where\u2019s the evidence that Debbie would be devastated have I cried or beaten you up in the past when you haven\u2019t done all the homework we discussed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: Have I given you a hard time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Have I punished you or called the police?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: So where is the evidence that Debbie would be extremely disappointed or react in some adverse way as you\u2019re implying? Where is the evidence? Has it happened before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Not with you in my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m talking about me because we\u2019re...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: Not with you. We\u2019re here in the present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: Yes (jokes), I think we are. Is this a time machine? [00:27:12.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: Not with you. I project sometimes that it might happen but it hasn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Notice that, okay. Notice that tendency. Projecting. The more you notice your tendency, the easier it will continue to be to catch it and change it. So you have a tendency to predict, project, and believe what may not true. Important to watch that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: Okay. So just to clarify, is there evidence that Debbie is disappointed? And in fact, is there evidence to the contrary even when you don\u2019t do everything that we discuss?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20140-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20140-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: Is there evidence to the contrary? Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20145\">THERAPIST: Okay. And then worst case scenario and I have a facial expression and you interpreted I disapproved and acted untrue to my role...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20147\">CLIENT: Right, right, right. What would be the worst thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20149\">THERAPIST: What would be the horror in that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014B\">CLIENT: That I would continue to the horror would be that I would continue to have my irrational beliefs about it. [00:28:20.28] So it wouldn\u2019t be actually what occurred, it would be what I would tell myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014D\">THERAPIST: And again, wouldn\u2019t you have choice in that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yes, I would.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20151\">THERAPIST: Isn\u2019t this boiling down to that familiar theme of need for approval?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20153\">CLIENT: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20155\">THERAPIST: Why do you need my approval?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20157\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20159\">THERAPIST: No, you don\u2019t. It probably feels nicer but do you need it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015B\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015D\">THERAPIST: And is there any evidence that if I didn\u2019t approve of something you did, that we wouldn\u2019t keep going forward anyway in our goal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2015F\">CLIENT: No. Of course we would keep working for improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">THERAPIST: So when you stop and think about your premises, do you see how you can notice when you believe falsehoods and through thinking about your thinking you can recognize how false such ideas are. Whereas as in the past you simply tended to believe what you believed without questioning those beliefs ...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">THERAPIST: And carry on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: No, there is change. [00:29:18.23] There\u2019s been there\u2019s definitely been a lot of change. But I keep reminding myself that, like you said, when I go back to those tendencies of thinking everybody would\u2019ve done this by now, Debbie\u2019s going to be all that. I remind myself I have to stop myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201671\">and really catch myself in those moments. But what I\u2019m saying is, I guess, any I know that you say it takes practice, right, of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: Ongoing effort, ongoing practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: Ongoing, but I think that there\u2019s a physical reaction that I get. Maybe I should be a little bit clearer and just say that there\u2019s a physical...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: You should?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: Oh, I\u2019ll try to be a little clearer with it. Well maybe I\u2019d like to be...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: It would be beneficial\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been saying that a lot. It would be beneficial. I\u2019ve been saying it on the phone with parents actually. [00:30:01.05] So thank you for all the things you\u2019ve taught me. But I think I get a physical reaction every time that I it happens every time. When I\u2019m even doing the homework and I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201731\">getting to the I\u2019m going about my thing and I\u2019m oh, A, wonderful. Oh B, beliefs, I know those beliefs. And it\u2019s even fun. It\u2019s like a journal. I love it. I love it. I almost get a little high from it. And then and the C consequences. Oh, well I feel sad, I feel anxious, I act out. I do this. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201732\">cry to my friends. I whatever X, Y, and Z, whatever I do. And then I get to the disputing part and I actually get a physical, I can\u2019t breathe type of reaction because and I don\u2019t know what that is. I don\u2019t know what that is, and I think that\u2019s the part that I feel it\u2019s a little bit daunting because <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201733\">if I just get over the hump of all right Jessa, you could just do and I hear your voice in my head. What would Debbie say could be a good dispute. I look at the book. [00:31:01.13] I read the book and it\u2019s like all of that, it\u2019s so physically overwhelming to me that I don\u2019t know where to go with it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201734\">if that is coming across, if it\u2019s making sense to you the way it makes sense to me. Because it\u2019s every time when I\u2019m doing the work, no matter what it is, I can sit there I wrote pages, pages of the shoulds and the musts and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20172-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20172-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20175\">THERAPIST: Okay, if you thought just before you got to that disputing part, which is the time in this process you say you get yourself into a panic...\u201dWhat am I telling myself to create the panic? \u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20177\">CLIENT: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20179\">THERAPIST: Because that\u2019s what it sounds like, the panic and uncomfortable breathing \u2026 If you thought to yourself \u201coh, the disputing now, well I don\u2019t yet feel anywhere near expert at this, but let me do the best I can. And if I don\u2019t do it right, I\u2019ll discuss it with Debbie. And if I do it partly right, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201791\">I\u2019m still in a learning process. Let me do the best I can\u201d... [00:32:03.20] if you believed that, if you allowed yourself to believe that you didn\u2019t have to do it perfectly well, do you think you would still experience those panicky reactions? Think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B\">CLIENT: I have thought about it. I have thought about it because I know what you\u2019ve said other times. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. I think so I\u2019ll agree with it partially, that I think partially that I would that it would come a little bit easier because I wouldn\u2019t be so focused on it being perfect. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2017B1\">But the other piece of it is that sometimes I don\u2019t even know what to say. I really somebody...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017D\">THERAPIST: So you think \u201cI have to do this perfectly well\u201d doesn\u2019t it come back to the same I \u201cshould\u201d do it well enough or perfectly well? Even if you take away the perfect out of the sentence and think \u201cI should do it adequately\u201d. That \u201cHave-to\/should\u201d: isn\u2019t that what contributes to the panic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20181\">THERAPIST: So there it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20185\">THERAPIST: Why should you do it adequately or perfectly well?

Each situation is so different and so unique. It\u2019s there\u2019s never one, and I think that\u2019s actually actually, one of the things not to cut you off because I know you were saying something but one of the things that I had in my mind and I said, bring that up to Debbie because it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201931\">so powerful for me that I couldn\u2019t really I really couldn\u2019t, in the moment anyway. Maybe we can look at it together today. But last week, I guess it was or, no, two weeks ago. It was right after you one of our last sessions, before you left. I was on the crosstown bus and there was a young I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201932\">on the bus and I\u2019m standing on the bus and I\u2019m in pain so I\u2019m not in a very I wasn\u2019t in a good mind frame. [00:34:07.16] Let me just tell you that. And I felt physically weak because I was holding on and it was I felt like I wanted to sit down but there was no seats; it was a packed bus. So physically <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201933\">I remember not feeling good. And this little boy, he was probably like 10 or so, starts running after the bus when the bus was driving. So he\u2019s going miles a minute and this kid comes up and starts slamming the window of the bus. So the next thing I know all I see I see him slamming this window and <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201934\">I\u2019m thinking to myself okay, that\u2019s not smart but whatever. And then the next thing I know the bus stops because he was stopping at the stop and then the kid, all you see is no more kid. I laugh about it now because thank God he was okay, but I see no more kid. And everybody on the bus saw no more kid. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201935\">They all saw the same thing I saw. I screamed out and I said, no. Because immediately you think okay, this child is now under the bus.

I don\u2019t doubt that some others assumed that. My hunch is that very possibly some others didn\u2019t assume it and wouldn\u2019t have assumed it until they saw evidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A7\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201A9\">THERAPIST: I just want to point out that although many people might have had your tendency to freak themselves out[sharp intake of breath] initially, but I want to point out to you that not necessarily everyone would. There are people who might have the presence and steadiness of mind to think wow, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201A91\">that looks fishy, I wonder if whether that happened \u2013 let me check it out. So don\u2019t assume, unless you have evidence, that all or even many people think the same as you do. [00:36:01.24]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB\">CLIENT: So after all of this happened I was in a tizzy to say oh, and then I thought I was superwoman and I\u2019m getting off the bus to help this kid. I\u2019m supposed to be at an appointment, I\u2019m running off to go do my due diligence. I don\u2019t know what I was going to do. And meanwhile the next thing I see <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB1\">is the mother literally picking up her son, grabbing him. He looked like he did fall but was not under the bus. But he did fall and was maybe pushed, I don\u2019t know, by the force. Did fall. And then she grabbed him up and he had just a mark on his face and that was it. So I was beating myself up the whole <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB2\">ride to my appointment after that happened because the [sharp intake of breath] freak out, the panicky breathing, all that, I was having a really hard time coming down from the excitement of the whole incident. And it wasn\u2019t anything. And so this one woman\u2019s looking at me, they\u2019re all discussing it <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB3\">on the bus, and they were like oh, I saw your face. They all saw my face. They\u2019re like we saw you were ready to I was like there we go, here it is. So it was hard for me to calm down physically, and then even after I did calm down, I have to tell you, I was still thinking about it for like into the <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201AB4\">hours into the night. [00:37:16.24] And I said, how can I talk to Debbie about this when she gets back because it was a physical so I didn\u2019t know what I was telling myself.

What color?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201B7\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t really go that far.

Just pointing out your tendency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BB\">CLIENT: Yeah, to think the worst.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201BD\">THERAPIST: And dramatize and extrapolate and just get yourself absorbed in that narrative.

So that\u2019s not stopping you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C7\">CLIENT: Oh. Okay. Thinking that when my heart starts racing in those moments that my mind doesn\u2019t really isn\u2019t a steady mind. I\u2019m not an ER doctor, I don\u2019t see those things every day, and it\u2019s a child. And the thought that it was I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t have reacted if it was an adult. I probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201C71\">would\u2019ve reacted the same way if it was an adult, but it felt even more so because it was a young person. [00:39:05.19] And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201C9\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re justifying your catastrophizing now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I don\u2019t really know why I do it.

And he\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201D9\">THERAPIST: And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DB\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t really think much. That\u2019s the thing. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of thought. Or maybe there was and I wasn\u2019t aware of the thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DD\">THERAPIST: What in all probability was your view about the situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not looking good. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know what that was. It probably scared me to even go any further with it. I just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Correct. And I think, and you tell me now if you think I\u2019m wrong, but I think isn\u2019t that what might frequently happen when you experience physical panic, that there\u2019s a thought that\u2019s frightening and there\u2019s (sharp intake of breath) an arrest. [00:40:14.29] And you aren\u2019t assessing things <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E11\">clearly and realistically \u2013 you feel panic and you don\u2019t think it through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Which is how REBT can help you, because it invites you to think it through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">THERAPIST: And so my hypothesis is, going back to your telling me that when you\u2019re doing the homework and you get to the D you find it hard to breathe, when you get to the stage of disputing, and it comes back to what I started proposing before, that in all probability you\u2019re telling yourself ideas <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E91\">connected to \u201cI should, and if I don\u2019t it\u2019s awful and it has to be adequate and if not perfectly adequate and when it\u2019s not it proves what a shitty person I am and not good enough and unworthy\u201d. [00:41:03.12] So I think this cocktail of beliefs that seem, from what you\u2019ve told me, to have been habitual <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E92\">up until now, may cause this [sharp intake of breath] physical response, and then you don\u2019t question it and hence it grips you until you distract yourself, do something else, which doesn\u2019t really remove, lessen, or resolve the frankly false beliefs and resulting panic. Those irrational beliefs. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E93\">word \u2018false\u2019 is perhaps not the right word to use in this context, because at the time of the experience, it\u2019s truly what you believe. That does not mean it is factual. Such beliefs are not rational, they\u2019re not based on reality. So do you see how you\u2019re creating that panic by thinking the irrational thoughts?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N201E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Not intentionally but just through succumbing to habitual self-putdowns, and not making more effort to do whatever task, even if it\u2019s not adequate, and even if it will be imperfect, which in all...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201EF\">CLIENT: So in that particular situation then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Which one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F3\">CLIENT: The one with the boy and the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Do you mean the homework and your panic, or the boy and your panic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F7\">CLIENT: The boy, the boy. [00:42:09.13] Yeah, the homework, I see well it\u2019s all related. I mean it\u2019s I can\u2019t really separate the boy and the homework, so all of it. So you\u2019re saying...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201F9\">THERAPIST: When talking about your panic\u2026 The boy and the homework are the A, the activating event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FB\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry, the boy and the homework are the activating event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FD\">THERAPIST: And then we\u2019re talking about what you described as symptoms of panic, [sharp intake of breath] holding the breath and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N201FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, it\u2019s like a little panic attack. So what\u2019s my question now.

It\u2019s a stretch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20207\">CLIENT: I did forget what I was going oh, in those moments, I don\u2019t know, maybe as my tutor, maybe we can go over one I know we do that a lot but maybe I could kind of say it out loud this time and then maybe you can sort of chime in after, like let me sort of say what I think the dispute would <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202071\">be and then maybe you could say it after instead of in the moment when I\u2019m saying it. [00:43:20.26] Okay. So we can use the boy and the bus because that was pretty significant for me. So the activating event was that I saw this child hit the bus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20209\">THERAPIST: When you say hit the bus, he actively banged, and it\u2019s not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2020B\">CLIENT: He actively banged on...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2020D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not like he fell into...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2020F\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, no. Yeah, sorry. He hit the bus with his hand to probably try to stop the bus. Right. And then the bus pulled over and the boy was no longer in my sight and I thought the worst, that he fell under the bus and that he was hit. Oh, I forgot. I left out one part. There was a big bang. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2020F1\">That was what it was. There was a thump.

So now I understand... Okay. So the worthless I well I can kind of pinpoint what I was telling myself <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N202331\">but we\u2019ll do that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20235\">THERAPIST: Feeling worthless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20237\">CLIENT: Okay, I\u2019m feeling worthless but can I should I say, or can I say, where that comes where the I\u2019m feeling worthless part comes...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20239\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s from the B, is it not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2023B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it is, but I\u2019m saying that it came from the in other words I just recognized I wasn\u2019t able to break it down, but I was wondering why would I feel worthless if this happened with this boy. [00:46:12.07] What does that have to do with me feeling worthless. And it\u2019s because I looked at <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2023B1\">other people and said, they\u2019re not letting this affect their day like I do. I shouldn\u2019t be letting this affect my day like I do. That\u2019s it.

So they don\u2019t change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202BF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s very familiar to me, the idea of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202C1\">THERAPIST: So if your girlfriend was with a partner who beat her up, would you say I understand, you\u2019re more comfortable with the partner.

[00:53:23.18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202CF\">CLIENT: My advice to myself is to begin to really focus on or start to begin to recognize healthier patterns so that the panic doesn\u2019t continue to take over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D1\">THERAPIST: So you don\u2019t allow it to take over. How about contemplating a willingness, if you work to have it Jessa, of allowing yourself to feel uncomfortable with what now is unfamiliar until you get more comfortable with it. Accepting it\u2019s going to feel uncomfortable but it\u2019s healthier. And the more <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202D11\">you practice it the more familiar it gets. [00:54:15.15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D3\">CLIENT: But you know what\u2019s interesting, though, this helps me, too, because it makes when I get frustrated...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D5\">THERAPIST: When you get yourself frustrated...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D7\">CLIENT: When I get myself frustrated, when I see somebody who\u2019s in an abusive relationship, let\u2019s say, or somebody who has you watch them and say, how could they not I, in a way, I\u2019m starting to see that it all runs under the same sort of gamut of what\u2019s comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202D9\">THERAPIST: Or familiar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202DB\">CLIENT: Familiar. Familiar, not comfortable, right. Familiar. And I just think as much and again, I don\u2019t I really, really don\u2019t want to continue to revisit childhood stuff, but I think the reason...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202DD\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s okay. The longer you keep believing it the more harm it can be it\u2019s very relevant to look and let\u2019s keep working on disputing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P16-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202DF\">CLIENT: Well yeah, because I think I don\u2019t think I realize I don\u2019t even think I realize that that panic was something that was I thought that I was the one that was panicking, and then when I was a child I would run to my parents and say, oh my God, I\u2019m panicking, and then they\u2019d fix it. [00:55:11.24] <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202DF1\">And now that I\u2019ve gotten older it\u2019s taken me a long time to see that they, too, panic about different things. They just have their way of showing it so that it doesn\u2019t look like panic. It\u2019s panic disguised. So it is it\u2019s a way to be completely real in this situation and to share what it is, I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202DF2\">my fear, my deep, deep, deep fear is that if I, let\u2019s say, become healthier or start disputing things, that I\u2019m going to distance myself from my family. That\u2019s really what it is because I hear in their language and the way that they speak. And we are close, I\u2019m close with my family, I can hear the <\/span><span data-id=\"P16-N202DF3\">irrational beliefs. So every time that I get closer to disputing it, I feel farther away from my relationship with them, if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P16-N202DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"15\"><span data-id=\"P16-N202DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":17,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"17\" data-page=\"17\">\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E1\">THERAPIST: I understand what you\u2019re saying. If you say to me does it make sense, well what\u2019s your definition of sense? [00:56:10.21] Is it inevitable that if you stop thinking in healthy ways the way they do you\u2019re going to be distant from them? There\u2019s as much, in my view, potential, if not greater <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202E11\">potential, to be closer to them than distant. These sessions are not about you converting your family. They\u2019re about you living comfortably as YOU within the family, within the world, within your life, within yourself. So it would be like you being part of an alcoholic family and your being an alcoholic <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202E12\">and then you stop drinking excessively and then you say, no, I better get back to it because if I don\u2019t then I won\u2019t be part of or as accepted or as comfortable in my family. [00:57:08.15] Do you see that scenario?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E3\">CLIENT: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E5\">THERAPIST: Can you see that\u2019s similar to what you\u2019re doing now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, I do see it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202E9\">THERAPIST: Your work had better not be a mission to change them, it\u2019s a mission of recognizing what was modeled for you, recognizing how for so long you thought that was normal, truth or the way reality was. Now you\u2019re getting new insights that can enable you to view family more objectively without <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202E91\">being like them and therefore step by step finding it easier to live comfortably in your own ski. For example, to allow yourself not to make the bed perfectly, as mummy says you should. But being flexible and telling yourself I\u2019m in a hurry today, I\u2019m going to make the bed imperfectly and it is no big <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202E92\">deal. Not hearing your mother severely reprimanding you for an imperfect bed, though she did so many years ago when you were a child. You can tell yourself On Saturday I\u2019ll have more time, I\u2019ll make it a little better. No big deal. Do you see what I am getting at? [00:58:06.01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202EB\">CLIENT: I do, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202ED\">THERAPIST: Just being easier on yourself is not the formula for separation from your family. Frankly it more likely could result in the contrary. You may find it easier on the inside to have a giggle when you\u2019re with them. Maybe outwardly there may be differences, which would begin a whole new drama <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202ED1\">perhaps. But on the inside you wouldn\u2019t have to suffer emotionally, when you see things from a healthy perspective. Do you see the point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202EF\">CLIENT: I do. I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P17-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P17-N202F1\">THERAPIST: Now our session time is coming to an end for tonight. So we haven\u2019t fully completed, or you haven\u2019t, going over the ABCDE real time of panic about disputing, or coming back to the instant of thinking that the boy was under the bus \u2013 though he thankfully wasn\u2019t under the bus. Thankfully. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P17-N202F11\">I hope from what we\u2019ve done so far, with this example you brought to us to look at, that what contributed to your panic, tell me if you think I\u2019m wrong, was largely your anticipating the worst before you had evidence.

Self-flagellation. And blame, yes. You see? And with awareness in a moment of panic, a panic can be your alarm clock, like waking you up in the morning. An alarm waking you up \u2013 reminding you to think about your thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P18-N202FF\">CLIENT: I have an alarm clock too. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20301\">THERAPIST: Okay. So you have your alarm and you wake up and you say, oh, it\u2019s time for me to get up. In the same way, if you feel this panic, if you take some breaths, step back, make the effort, that can be like your alarm to yourself saying, oh, I\u2019m telling myself harmful stuff again. And then you <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203011\">could dispute it as you started to do and then come up with effective new philosophy or attitude and behavior, which could be \u2013 \u201c let me see if anything happened to the boy and look for the evidence\u201d. [01:00:20.00] And then, assuming you see he\u2019s okay, then notice what you were telling yourself to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203012\">yourself panic. And also noticing the \u201cshould\u201d on yourself, how you should, Saint Jessa, not think about work when there\u2019s crisis now and then after identifying your should disputing them, and coming up with effective new philosophies. Even if there was a bad accident, telling yourself:\u201d I\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203013\">do what I can. Accidents happen. I didn\u2019t throw the boy under the bus.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s maybe we could talk...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20319\">THERAPIST: How about e-mailing me your disputing at that moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031B\">CLIENT: Oh, I see what you\u2019re saying. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031D\">THERAPIST: E-mail me what you\u2019re doing about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P18-N2031F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20321\">THERAPIST: And I will respond as soon as I get the e-mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P18-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20323\">CLIENT: No, I understand what you\u2019re saying. But yeah, get I actually did do that. I did do that. I e-mailed you when you were away. It never it was the weirdest thing. I was writing, writing, writing, writing, writing. I wrote at least half a page. I mean it was a lot. No, it was maybe almost a <\/span><span data-id=\"P18-N203231\">full page. It was a long e-mail and it was I guess it was partially anyway, it was I pressed send; it was gone. I could not retrieve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P18-N20322-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"17\"><span data-id=\"P18-N20322-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":19,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"19\" data-page=\"19\">\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20325\">THERAPIST: I didn\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20327\">CLIENT: I know. That\u2019s the point. It wasn\u2019t meant to go through. It was so bizarre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20329\">THERAPIST: Interesting. Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2032B\">CLIENT: I was on a rant. Debbie I know you\u2019re away and blah, blah, blah, but na, na, na, na, na, went on and on and on and it was just all the things, and I don\u2019t even remember what I said now because it was one of the nights that had been typical but I was able to type. And so I said let me write her. <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2032B1\">But anyway, not the point. But I\u2019ll do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2032D\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s a good idea, which I do welcome you to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2032F\">CLIENT: Okay. But it\u2019s easier for me to type sometimes anyway than it is for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20331\">THERAPIST: Then I\u2019m giving you another piece of homework and you can type it, which is completing ABC forms on your tendency to create panic. [01:03:40.10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20333\">CLIENT: Oh, just do the regular self-help form.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20335\">THERAPIST: On creating panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20337\">CLIENT: Oh, that the A is creating panic? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20339\">THERAPIST: The \u201cB\u2019s\u201d create it. And do the forms about anything else. But that is your homework. And next time we have a session that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to ask about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2033A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033B\">CLIENT: Oh great. Okay. I\u2019m joking. It\u2019ll be wonderful. It may be; it may not be. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be. I\u2019m not a prophet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2033C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033D\">THERAPIST: Any final questions? By the way sometimes you act like you are a prophet, do you not? Assuming you know the future ! So catch yourself. Any other questions or comments before we finish?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2033F\">CLIENT: Yes, if next week, also, if or next session, whenever we do, I forgot to ask it tonight, but if we can address just gut not about panic but just gut instinct about certain things and how that fits into REBT?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20341\">THERAPIST: Bring it up after we discuss your homework. [01:01.21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20343\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I was going to okay, so I might feel differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20345\">THERAPIST: Let\u2019s see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20346\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20347\">CLIENT: Because that was my other question for tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20348\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20349\">THERAPIST: Okay, now how are you feeling now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2034B\">CLIENT: Oh better. Definitely better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2034D\">THERAPIST: Better than what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2034F\">CLIENT: Than I was when I was waiting for you to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20351\">THERAPIST: Which was feeling? \u2013 tell me briefly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20353\">CLIENT: I guess panic, looking back on it, probably panicky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20355\">THERAPIST: And now do you feel panicky?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20357\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20359\">THERAPIST: And why do you think that is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2035B\">CLIENT: Because we talked about it, number one, we addressed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2035D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s too general. What\u2019s different in your mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P19-N2035F\">CLIENT: Well what I\u2019m telling myself is that, number one, that it\u2019s okay that I\u2019m going through these things and that I\u2019m figuring it out. I\u2019m learning. It\u2019s not a new it\u2019s something new, and anything new or unfamiliar takes time to sort of understand. And I\u2019m not sitting here and beating the crap <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2035F1\">out of myself over the fact that I that there were things I didn\u2019t know, and continue to maybe not know, and over time I\u2019ll hopefully have a better sense of what those philosophies and ideas are. [01:06:14.09] They\u2019re not necessarily going to just come to me like I thought that they should. I\u2019m catching <\/span><span data-id=\"P19-N2035F2\">myself. I no, I but I mean that\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking. I thought they should. They must.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20361\">THERAPIST: And now you realize...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P19-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20363\">CLIENT: No, and it\u2019s for my own personal experience with this whole thing. I think it\u2019s a little bit of what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for it\u2019s a little it\u2019s a little shocking. It\u2019s a little bit of a surprise to think that it\u2019s a little humbling. That\u2019s the word I was looking for, humbling.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P19-N20362-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"18\"><span data-id=\"P19-N20362-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":20,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561794\" data-realpage=\"20\" data-page=\"20\">\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20365\">THERAPIST: Careful about changing humbling into anything that could be self-depreciating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20367\">CLIENT: No, I didn\u2019t feel that it was. I actually didn\u2019t feel that when I said it. I feel like it\u2019s humbling because of what I thought that I knew before but not but a factual thing, that I went to graduate school, this, that, I was so reading all the time, how do I not know. But it\u2019s not that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203671\">It\u2019s just you learn something new all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20369\">THERAPIST: Not everyone learns something new all the time. You\u2019re electing to learn this new thing, and it seems very...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2036A\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2036B\">CLIENT: I enjoy learning new things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2036C\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2036D\">THERAPIST: ...beneficial. So just ending on the note that you feel different now than you did an hour and a bit before, because you are thinking differently about it. Correct?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P20-N2036F\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20371\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re feeling less panicky now because you have a different attitude. And that is the point. Good job. Good job. You are becoming more aware. You are catching yourself more often. It\u2019s an ongoing process and you\u2019re going along, humanly, with some good progress and some insights, especially <\/span><span data-id=\"P20-N203711\">when you are not appearing to progress in some matters. So the journey continues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P20-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P20-N20373\">CLIENT: Oh my God I get tired.
