How are you today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Doing okay. I think I\u2019m going to do dancing two nights a week instead of three.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m not sure that three is sustainable, and so far I\u2019ve been making two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: That seems realistic then, noticing what\u2019s happening and base it on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s actually enough but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s a difference, so I think looking at the changes that you make in your life, kind of figuring out what they do for you, rather than whether it\u2019s enough or not enough. Did you enjoy it? [1:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve gotten better at walking so it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: The weather change this weekend probably helped with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, well I meant more that when I walk it doesn\u2019t hurt sort of thing, because before my lower back would hurt pretty soon. If I carry too much it still sometimes happens, but I\u2019ve been not hurting most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so if you think about what\u2026 basing what you do and noticing what changes it\u2019s making, I know that you want to lose weight but also noticing things like having more mobility, having more fun. You were feeling pretty isolated, so dancing is something that helps decrease that. You\u2019re just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">out seeing more people. Those things are all positive changes for you in the week. And if it also helps you to control your weight, that\u2019s great. If there are other things you need to do in order to achieve that goal, then we might find that that\u2019s the case. But I think looking at your overall health <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">in terms of both your medical health and your\u2026 your physical health and your mental health, you\u2019ve got to look at sort of what are the things you\u2019re doing and how are they affecting you. [2:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, and today after this appointment I\u2019m getting together with a friend and knitting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So yeah, I\u2019ve\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: When did you reach out for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well we were originally going to meet last week but then things came up, so I guess about a week and a half ago. But yeah, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still\u2026 I\u2019m trying to\u2026 I think I might be eating less but I\u2019m not\u2026 still not doing the whole getting all my vegetables in and stuff. And still been doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">a lot of ordering take out just because I\u2026 neither Sydney nor I usually feel like cooking or doing all the dishes and stuff. And he had made mac and cheese and there were a lot of dishes with that that we still haven\u2019t actually got into because he said he\u2019d do them, and he hasn\u2019t done them yet, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s a hard routine to break. [3:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I don\u2019t want\u2026 because often it ends up, then, that I end up doing the dishes, but if he says he\u2019ll do them, I should let him do them. But then again, if they don\u2019t get done after a certain time then they need to be done. So I\u2019m not sure what\u2026 there\u2019s not really good compromise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your time frame?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Well I guess my time frame is before the next time that I want to cook something. And we\u2019ve just been extending that by going out or ordering in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you\u2019re giving it a good long time it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean he\u2019s been freaking out because today, actually right now, he had his job interview and it was a technical interview. And before he was freaking out and I didn\u2019t know why, and I thought it was just his normal oh no, it\u2019s something happening; it\u2019s important, therefore I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">to have a panic attack. And I was being sort of unsympathetic because I was just kind of pissed off because here he is having a job interview and I haven\u2019t heard back from many people. And I\u2019m actually out applying for jobs and if I had an interview I\u2019d be happy. When I talked to him yesterday I finally <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">figured out it was because he hadn\u2019t been programming for the past two years since he\u2019s been unemployed, and it\u2019s they\u2019re going to ask him programming questions and he didn\u2019t feel ready for it. So then I was more sympathetic because that actually makes sense. And I thought it was more like a talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B3\">about what you do kind of, like the interviews that I have. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so he wasn\u2019t feeling qualified. [5:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he had\u2026 he\u2019d been programming. Had he not been unemployed for the past two years he would\u2019ve been able to do it with no problem, but he wasn\u2019t feeling ready. Then again he was also shooting himself in the foot by\u2026 well I guess he only had a few days to prepare because\u2026 okay, so he had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">talked to the recruiter a while ago and he had put off that talk for a while because he had gotten really sick with the bronchitis. Then he finally did talk to them\u2026 her, and she was like okay, we need to set up an interview with the actual interviewers, here\u2019s a bunch of questions that you need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">fill out. And he stalled on that and finally got it back. And then for at least\u2026 it took him a couple of weeks after talking to the recruiter just to send that in. And then\u2026 or either that or\u2026 there was some step that he took two weeks to get back to them, or more than two weeks even. And then he didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">hear back from them until we thought okay, well he took too long. I guess that means they\u2019re not interested anymore. And then they finally got back to him on Thursday with the interview slot for Monday, giving him three days to prepare. And had he known they were still actively considering him he would\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F4\">been preparing the whole time, but then since he only had the weekend he didn\u2019t prepare at all. He might still be fine but he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s going to be fine, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, I hope that it goes well for him. [7:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean the whole thing. The job is in Florida so he\u2019s not sure he\u2019d even want it anyway. Facebook does have the office in Boston for their telecommuters but this is a job probably working with their servers, which he\u2019d have to be physically present there. So he\u2019s not even sure that he wants it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: How do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know because the thing is, if he\u2026 because he\u2019d only accept it if he had enough for both of us to live off of in Florida. So I think\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a long shot that he\u2019ll get it. I do think it would be a long shot that he\u2019d get it and it would be enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">that he\u2019d actually take it, and even then I\u2026 he\u2019s still pretty depressed and still hasn\u2019t gotten\u2026 his psychiatrist still hasn\u2019t gotten back to him, and he is on no anti-anxiety meds and so I don\u2019t even know. Maybe working would be good for him and make him feel better, but I don\u2019t know whether or not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">he\u2019s at the point where he could hold down a job. So yeah, I mean I\u2019m hoping he does well so that way it\u2019s his choice whether or not he wants to take the job, but yeah, I don\u2019t know how hard the questions are going to be that they ask him. [8:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: How could you know that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Because I know nothing about technical interviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because you\u2019re in different fields.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, in my field it\u2019s not those kind of questions at all. And I mean I guess I\u2019m\u2026 I mean it hasn\u2019t been\u2026 I haven\u2019t been looking for jobs that much. Last week I didn\u2019t\u2026 I mean I didn\u2019t check all the sites but I checked some of the sites, and the ones that I did I didn\u2019t find anything that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">could apply to, so this\u2026 I guess this is now my third week of unemployment and so far I\u2019ve applied to jobs one of those three weeks. But then again, this week has only just started so I guess I\u2019ve only missed one week of applying to things. But still\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: What stopped you from checking all of your typical sites last week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I guess because I was just\u2026 I really don\u2019t know, possibly forgetting about the other ones. [9:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Out of practice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is very silly. And then when I thought of it I was already out of the okay, I\u2019ll try to find things and apply to them mode, and it was just like yeah, whatever, which I shouldn\u2019t have done because if I had found something I could\u2019ve always just bookmarked it and looked at it later. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">But I guess now I can always go back and look at everything because it\u2019s probably not going to make that much of a difference if it\u2019s a few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: And kind of setting up a routine for yourself of when you check, where you look, so you can get back in that rhythm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is harder than if I have to set up a routine of okay, this is when I apply for jobs, then what happens if I get to that time and I don\u2019t feel like it. And then again, what happens if I only waited until I feel like it and never feel like it. I can\u2019t\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: The expectation that you\u2019re going to feel like doing what you need to do. I mean there are kind of\u2026 you think about separate categories of things. There are things that you want to do and then there are your responsibilities that you need to do. And I think at this point looking for jobs <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">and applying for reasonable jobs is something you need to do. That\u2019s one of your responsibilities as somebody who has an apartment, has college degrees, has graduate degrees. Your parents are expecting it of you. So there\u2019s a difference between being unable to do something and not wanting to do something. [11:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, just like it was the same thing with writing papers in college, in grad school. If I was\u2026 I guess these periods also came more often then, but there were periods that I was like okay, I\u2019m totally writing this paper, would write tons of things, and it would be really, really good. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">there were times that I had to write a paper and wasn\u2019t feeling it and getting any sentence was like pulling teeth. It was just not coming out of me. And it\u2019s the same thing with cover letters except it\u2019s even worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because you\u2019re not really\u2026 I mean [inaudible] writing papers. You may have had something that you were\u2026 a topic that you were interested in.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, or at least I could\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Whereas cover letters feel pretty dry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, especially because it was so much easier when I actually had things to talk about, like sources and proving points, and a cover letter\u2019s not like that at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right, so they\u2019re\u2026 it seems less likely that sort of design\u2026 divine inspiration to write is not going to come as much for job applications as it does, or as it did, for papers that you might be interested in. So your bar for what you push through has to be a little bit different. [13:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean they\u2019re\u2026 because the ones that I wrote two weeks ago I did have a period of oh, I can totally do this. And I still get it. Yesterday we\u2026 Sydney helped me and we actually took out all the trash and recycling. I willed myself to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: How did you feel when you were done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: A lot better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so looking forward to that feeling, whether it\u2019s relief or pride or accomplishment, that whatever that better was, knowing that that might follow. So it might not feel good when you get started but there is that positive feeling at the end for having done something that you know is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">on that list of things that you just do as a responsible adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just really hard with cover letters because you can push yourself to do the dishes; you don\u2019t have to think to do the dishes. I\u2019m just hoping I can get back to the point where writing cover letters doesn\u2019t actually require thinking either. [14:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Do you have copies on your computer of the ones you\u2019ve written before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes, every single one of them. And I keep them all in one folder. And the resumes I update and put a date on the\u2026 and then I have everything sorted by date so I can go back and be like okay, at this point in time I was applying for these kinds of jobs. Let me look and see what I wrote in them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">But the problem, I guess, is also now it\u2019s very different, what I\u2019m writing. So I have to start all over again. I can\u2019t just recycle stuff from my old cover letters because I had this job for a year and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Right, so you have to kind of\u2026 well but you\u2019ve applied to something since then, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: A couple of things. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: But none of them have had cover letters that I\u2019ve considered particularly good yet. So I mean I can use stuff from them\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Pieces maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: But if they all are like pieces of sucky cover letters then I just send out more sucky cover letters. Then I\u2019m sending out sucky cover letters. And then does that even really count as sending out cover letters if they\u2019re not going to get me anything. And maybe they\u2019re not as bad as I think they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">are but they\u2019re not particularly\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so subjective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: \u2026 good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: I mean you certainly don\u2019t get anything by not sending out one. [16:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well no, not quite. Because then I still have the potential to send one out and possibly send out a good one. If I sent out one that\u2019s bad then I can\u2019t send out another one for that job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: So by\u2026 if they\u2019re\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: How long do the jobs that are posted in your field typically stay open?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Usually at least a couple of weeks. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2026 it depends on\u2026 sometimes they even give you a closing date. The ones that I had applied for two weeks ago, at that time it had been three weeks since they had been posted but the postings were still up, so I was like does it mean that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">I would still have a chance for them maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: So knowing that they typically stay up for a couple of weeks gives you a time limit for your thinking of how long can you wait before deciding to send out something that feels okay but not great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: I mean and even\u2026 it\u2019s probably been more, that was just when I applied to it. They probably stay up for at least a month, usually, if not more. It just\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether they might, just on that first day, take those cover letters and not read ones that come in after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Or they might read them all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Right. I mean they may be slow to take down a posting or maybe they really are staying open to new applicants as long as the posting\u2019s up. But I think at least giving yourself sort of a time limit, because you\u2019re right. I guess you can wait and see if a better cover letter will sort of come <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">to you, but if you miss that window\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I mean usually if I write one that I\u2019m not too happy with but I think it\u2019s okay, I end up sending it out. So usually it\u2019s between thinking I\u2019ll write a bad one and not doing it or feeling like I\u2019m at a point that I can force myself to do it. And very rarely is it oh I feel like I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">totally write an awesome cover letter for this today. And yeah, when the jobs are more generic it makes it harder to send out something good, and if I\u2019m applying for a billion jobs at Yale, if I should be talking about how awesome it would be to work at Yale and stuff, you can only say that so many <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">ways before you get really, really repetitive. I mean sometimes I can talk about the different subdivisions but it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But if you\u2019re applying, I mean it\u2019s going to be repetitive because it\u2019s a cover letter. [18:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: And if the same people are then reading those same cover letters [inaudible] I don\u2019t want to make it sound like I copy everything from my other cover letters, but I run out of things to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Right, because it\u2019s a very limited\u2026 there\u2019s a very limited set of things that you\u2019re going to say in a cover letter. I mean you\u2019re going to talk about why you want to work at the place and why you\u2019d be a good fit for the job. And if the place is Yale and you\u2019re going to talk about why you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">want to work at Yale, you don\u2019t have a lot of room to be super creative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I guess then at that point I could recycle things outright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think for things that fit it\u2019s okay to be recycling things because this isn\u2019t a paper. Original thought is not, and creative interpretation is not, really the goal of this type of writing. This is very specific highlighting your skills. I want to work for you and you want me to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">for you for these reasons. Everybody\u2019s kind of writing similar things. It\u2019s hard to get really creative. And you want to stand out based on your unique fit rather than something really zany and creative in your cover letter. [20:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. And I\u2026 yeah, because if you do something gimmicky it will show and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And not for your field of work. If you were applying to be in some sort of art teacher position, maybe doing something zany and creative would be fabulous. But it doesn\u2019t seem like a fit for the types of job that you\u2019re typically applying for. So it seems like really your task is to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">out how to get motivated to look at what\u2019s out there so the opportunities don\u2019t pass you by, and how to motivate yourself to then sit down and start the process of producing the cover letters and the resume for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I mean I guess one thing I could do is sort of make watching a show on TV or listening to a podcast contingent on finishing a cover letter, which actually sometimes I\u2019ve done. Or like Sydney might\u2019ve already started listening to something and so it\u2019s on, but I\u2019m not really paying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">attention to it until I finish my cover letter because I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: So that might be a way to do it. I mean and getting\u2026 I was thinking about a routine in terms of just getting into a rhythm of your day. Maybe you start the day by what would get you ready to sit down and do some of this work. [21:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: I mean I guess having eaten already and showered and stuff and having some time to Internet at first. It\u2019s just hard to then cut off that Interneting and\u2026 before I write something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Would it make more sense to make playing on the Internet the reward?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Except then I\u2019m like oh, I can totally multitask and look\u2026 I mean I guess if I only allowed myself a set 20 minutes or something like that before I started working that could do it. The other thing is that I\u2019m still having trouble with the whole getting a normal sleep schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What was your sleep like this week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: I think\u2026 well for most of the time we were staying up more until one than two, so it\u2019s an improvement, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And then what time are you waking up in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Ten, eleven. This morning I actually\u2026 we\u2026 because Sydney had the interview we were going to go out for breakfast and stuff early, and I woke up at nine and I just could not get up. So I set an alarm for ten and then I couldn\u2019t really get up so I set an alarm for 10:45 and then I\u2026 yeah, at ten <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">I tried to wake up Sydney. I was hoping he would get up and then that I could go back to sleep and he could wake me up after he\u2019d showered or something. But that\u2019s also why I sent that 10:45 alarm, and then we both ended up going back to sleep. And I mean I guess we went to bed at\u2026 it was like 12:45. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF2\">It wasn\u2019t that late. I had got more than eight hours sleep but I was just having so much trouble, and I wasn\u2019t even\u2026 because sometimes it\u2019s like I have a really good dream or something and I\u2019m like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to face the outside world, I want to go back to this dream, I\u2019ll give myself another hour\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF3\">sleep. But this morning I was just so tired I could not get up. And I don\u2019t know, I mean I\u2019m feeling a little bit sick today and so I don\u2019t know if that has something to do with it, but it was just really frustrating. [24:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So last night you went to bed around one. What have the other nights been like? Is it similar or are you all over the place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Well yeah, it\u2019s sort of all over the place. I think there might have been one night that we actually got to bed early because I\u2026 yeah, we got to bed early on Friday night since I had my game on Saturday and that was starting at one, so I wanted to have time to get breakfast beforehand. And so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">yeah, that time I went to bed early. But the rest of the nights it\u2019s been late. Yeah, sometimes\u2026 because I went swing dancing on Wednesday night. I got back from that like 11:30 and then stayed up for awhile. And then on Saturday night I went contra dancing, got back from that at like 11:00, but then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">Sydney was out with friends. And he got back from that more around 12:00. Then we stayed up for another two hours after that. And I\u2019d been wanting to go to bed but it took a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So the inconsistency plus we had the time change this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, the time change definitely did not help. [25:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Sometimes that can really kind of alter people\u2019s sleep schedules a bit. So I think one thing that makes it hard if you\u2019re not having a consistent pattern of when you go to sleep and when you wake up, your circadian rhythm is irregular as well. And the pattern of going to bed at a fairly similar <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">time, waking up at a fairly similar time so that your sleep cycles can regulate to the amount of time that you typically sleep, that makes it easier to wake up. Throughout the night we go through several 90-minute sleep cycles, and it\u2019s easier to wake up as\u2026 in between a cycle rather than in the middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C92\">of one. And if you sleep for the same amount of time every night, approximately, if you typically sleep eight hours or typically sleep ten, your body adjusts so that it kind of knows when you\u2019re going to wake up. So your sleep cycle kind of matches what your wake up time is. So with inconsistency your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C93\">body has no idea what\u2019s going on or what\u2026 or when you\u2019re\u2026 when it should be ready to wake up. So I think that might be partly why it\u2019s sometimes really hard to get yourself to get up even though you\u2019ve had more than eight hours of sleep. Well your body didn\u2019t know what to expect. Was it getting eight <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C94\">that night, was it getting ten, was it getting up at eight in the morning or eleven in the morning. It\u2019s a big difference. [26:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Well actually this morning I realized that I did wake up before my alarm; I just couldn\u2019t get out of bed and get up. I mean I got out of bed to go to the bathroom and then I went back to sleep. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I think your goal is just to try to be a little more consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: How consistent is consistent? Is it\u2026 if it\u2019s within an hour is it okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s probably close enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s unrealistic to expect that you\u2019re going to go to bed at 11:15 on the dot every night. And you don\u2019t need to strive for that. But there\u2019s a big difference between going to bed at 11:45 and 2:00. So I think trying to go to bed within an hour, picking an hour, and then seeing if you can\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">and make one that\u2019s reasonable. If you know that you\u2019re going to want to be doing these dancing things a couple of nights a week, and that means you\u2019re not getting home until 11 or 11:30 at night, then don\u2019t pick 11 as your bedtime because that\u2019s going to be hard for you to stick with. So pay attention <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D52\">to what\u2019s actually going on, pick something that seems reasonable with that, and practice trying to see if you can arrange your bedtime to be within an hour of each other. That would be closer than what you\u2019re doing now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. [28:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: So I think we\u2019ve got to work with what\u2019s realistic rather than what would be super ideal. And then the same thing goes for waking up. Waking up at a consistent time is almost more important than going to bed at consistent time because that\u2019s the part that you don\u2019t have as much control over, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">right? You can pick when you go to bed. You don\u2019t have control over when your body wakes up naturally. You set your alarm but that doesn\u2019t impact what your\u2026 where your sleep cycle is. But if you consistently wake up around the same time then your sleep cycles will naturally regulate to that time. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D92\">that\u2019s what you want, so that when your\u2026 so that your body\u2019s ready to wake up when your alarm says so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it\u2019s been really hard to do that. I keep on falling into that trap. I guess today it was just so much worse than it usually is. I mean yesterday I got up pretty late too, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: That might be partly because of the time change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: It was the time change. I ended up getting up at noon. We went to bed at I guess what was almost two but then was almost three with the time change. And then I don\u2019t think I set an alarm. And yeah, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, my body\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: So see what you can do in terms of the things that you can control. It\u2019s going to take probably a couple of days for your body to get used to the time change. And at the same time you\u2019re kind of responding to the fact that you\u2019ve had sort of an erratic pattern of when you go to bed and wake <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E11\">up. So if it\u2019s important to you and you can control the factors of when you go to bed and when you set your alarm\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well I guess\u2026 is it possible that my body just needs more sleep? I thought that eight hours is normal. [30:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Eight to ten is all considered normal needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: At least I\u2019m finally sleeping through the night again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that makes a big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: I think\u2026 yeah, it mostly started after my job ended. And I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with the job. I don\u2019t think it did, other than I guess the\u2026 now I\u2019m actually going to get a walk in now that I don\u2019t have my job anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And that can help regulate sleep. So sleeping a little bit deeper at night, sleeping through the night because you\u2019re walking. Exercise can really help with that, too, because your body\u2019s actually physically tired enough to sleep through the night. And then you get a better rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: You mean even if I\u2019m not getting exercise every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Every day would be ideal. Some days is better than nothing, right? So I mean it\u2019s not all or nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: I got exercise last night, too, because\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Dancing, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: That was Saturday night. Last night I had rehearsal and I walked to the subway, which was about a ten-minute walk, and then it\u2019s another ten minutes or so from the subway to the room where we rehearse.

So singing things are annoying you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah, so people interrupting in the middle or singing the wrong thing because we do scale going up and then the person who\u2019s playing it will play the note and then the next\u2026 that we ended on, then the next note. And then someone was also singing that for no good reason and the person on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">piano was\u2026 and that just bothered me and I don\u2019t know why. And then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: So people kind of not following the rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, people just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Singer etiquette. [32:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: \u2026butt into [inaudible] It didn\u2019t used to be this way but in the past couple of years [inaudible] or usually Jack will sing random things all the time and sometimes when it\u2019s between\u2026 when they\u2019ve given us the note and when we\u2019re about to sing what we\u2019re supposed to sing. That\u2026 then it\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">distracting because\u2026 and that\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I should speak up but he really shouldn\u2019t be doing\u2026 we definitely, at one point, have been told you should not sing between giving the notes and when starting to sing because otherwise that will throw other people off with their notes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it feels disrespectful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: And then another one that I just got annoyed\u2026 so we were singing a song that\u2026 I had been alto forever and switched to tenor because they needed a tenor. And so the tenor they split into two parts. There\u2019s\u2026 because it goes low and high. And so they have one person singing lower notes and two <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F1\">of us singing the upper notes. So the person giving\u2026 and the lower note comes first and so the person giving the starting notes give the bass starting note and the low tenor starting note but not the high tenor starting note. And I asked if I could have a starting note but then she kept on playing it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F2\">over and over again and I\u2019m like no, I just wanted a starting note. And for some reason that\u2026 I guess just because\u2026 then I felt like it was like oh, she doesn\u2019t think I can sing it myself or something. But I\u2019m just like no, I just want a starting note like everyone else has a starting note. But if there <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F3\">was a little [inaudible] of her to actually control my annoyance and I don\u2019t know what that was.

I\u2026 yeah, I guess it\u2026 not quite, yeah. So I don\u2019t know what the deal is, why I get overly annoyed at these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Well what does it mean\u2026 what kind of meaning do you attach to their\u2026 the behavior of the people interrupting, or the girl misunderstanding what you were asking for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Well the interrupting, I\u2019m not really sure. I don\u2019t really place much meaning on it; it\u2019s just people doing their own thing and not paying attention to warm ups or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s the meaning you attach, that they\u2019re not paying attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, or just trying to railroad it, like do their own thing. And it\u2019s like you are not the one leading warm-ups; stop doing that. Even though I\u2019m not the one leading warm-ups. But I want my warm-ups to be led by one person and not by several people. And you shouldn\u2019t just get to sing something <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201231\">and make everybody else sing it when you\u2019re not leading warm-ups. That\u2019s not how rehearsal works. [36:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it\u2019s bumping up your\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 that behavior is sort of bumping up your\u2026 bumping up against your belief that this should be done a certain way, and nobody should interfere with it. So sometimes even just recognizing it. What is it that\u2019s really frustrating you. It\u2019s frustrating you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201251\">that\u2026 or angering you, maybe more appropriately, if it\u2019s a five, that people are breaking the rules that you\u2019re adhering to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s not like I think it\u2019s unfair or anything like that.

You\u2019re not in charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s as if you had no one enforcing them because they all think it\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: So are you the only one that\u2019s bothered by it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: I mean I haven\u2019t\u2026 because it\u2019s such a minor thing that I don\u2019t feel justified being annoyed by it, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone about it. So I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m the only one bothered by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: How does the rest of practice go for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: The rest of practice is usually fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: So would keeping that in perspective help you to let go of your feeling that the warm-up is a fairly small portion of the night, and the other part\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s not just that I\u2026 Jack butting in and singing random things isn\u2019t just warm-ups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s not just the warm-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: It\u2019ll be one where anytime we\u2019re in between runs or the song or anything like that. That\u2019s all the time. I mean he won\u2019t do it in the middle of a song.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: So what do you do in between songs? Or what do other people do? [38:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: Talk to each other. That\u2019s pretty much what the rest of the group does. Or we\u2019re discussing how it went and what needs to be changed and stuff like that. Well I guess the other thing that I also get annoyed is, I guess she does it on all the parts, but when we\u2019re learning new parts Cam usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201431\">likes to sing along with it. I guess I just feel like when she does that it feels like she doesn\u2019t think I can handle the part myself, which I guess it\u2019s not that I think\u2026 it\u2019s probably that she just wants to learn all the parts. But because we do sometimes have\u2026 okay, every\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s Cam?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">CLIENT: She\u2019s one of the people in the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">CLIENT: And yeah, she\u2019s president right now. She\u2019s the only one who does that. But sometimes they\u2019ll have everyone sing the bass part, but that\u2019s usually because the basses probably can\u2019t get it on their own. We\u2026 I mean I guess sometimes I\u2019ll have everyone sing\u2026 like Kempsey [sp?] had everyone sing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B1\">to increase sight reading, but nowadays it\u2019s usually just people in their parts singing the part. And yeah, it feels like she doesn\u2019t think we can get it ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">THERAPIST: And that probably leads you to feel bad [inaudible] interpreting it that way, that she thinks we can\u2019t get this on our own. [39:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and actually last night with the tenor part, Thomas had been on the lower tenor part and then he switched over to mine midway through the song. And I\u2026 afterwards he was like oh yeah, I decided to switch because I realized that the tenor, the lower part, was echoing the basses, so we need <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F1\">more people on the upper part. But during the time I was like wait, is he singing this now because I\u2019m singing it wrong, which is what I thought it was so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">THERAPIST: So the self-doubt thoughts or the\u2026 or a feeling like people are judging you and not trusting your abilities, those can really make you feel badly. So when\u2026 so I think it\u2019s important to recognize how you\u2019re interpreting what people are doing because if you\u2019re interpreting it in a way that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201511\">going to lead you to feel defensive or badly then you need to find another interpretation. Or leave it without interpretation, right. Because in that case you found out that oh, it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t feel\u2026 think you were doing a good enough job, it was completely unrelated to you at all. And it <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201512\">might be that Cam is unrelated to you wanting to learn all the parts because she\u2019s president and feels that she should have a handle on everybody\u2019s part. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because she\u2019s president, but I think it\u2019s just because she wants to learn all the parts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">THERAPIST: But again\u2026 but\u2026 so that\u2019s a benign interpretation, whether it\u2019s because she wants to learn all the parts just because that\u2019s who she is. But coming up with interpretation for things that don\u2019t make you feel badly, whether it\u2019s angry or upset. When you don\u2019t know it doesn\u2019t do you any good <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201551\">to come up with an interpretation that makes you feel bad. Until you can check in about something, see if you can come up with an interpretation that\u2019s neutral, like oh, Cam just likes to learn them all, or so and so\u2019s easily bored in between sets so he sings his own thing. [41:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it just gets annoying and repetitive. It\u2019s like maybe he\u2019s sometimes doing it to be funny and after you do it the hundredth time it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">THERAPIST: \u2026ceases to be funny. And you\u2026 maybe you could lead with that. Oh, yeah, this has now ceased to be funny. Without getting as invested in response to it. And the purpose of trying to not get really vested in the response is not to give him a break but give you a break from feeling maybe more <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201591\">upset than makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just wish all the decorum around warm-ups hadn\u2019t completely disappeared but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I can see that it\u2026 not taking it seriously bothers you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">CLIENT: It just\u2026 and if it were people just like talking in between or something like that, that probably wouldn\u2019t bother me as much as actively trying to sing something and be okay, where\u2019s [inaudible] when you\u2019re not the one leading it. Also, sometimes [inaudible] Jack sings something weird and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F1\">we do end up singing it, and it\u2019s something that isn\u2019t actually [inaudible] because the syllables are hard to sing or something like that. Because it\u2019s like okay, pick a random sentence and sing that. And that\u2019s not how you should be warming up. It should be things that allow the voice to get to its <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F2\">maximum range and stuff.

And it\u2019s just like no one knows how warm-ups work anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20165\">THERAPIST: Where did you learn about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20167\">CLIENT: I was in choir for all of high school and some of middle school, but four years of\u2026 two of those years were\u2026 was in the special audition choir. Then even\u2026 and also then [inaudible] used to have warm-up\u2026 do normal warm-ups. And so years and years of choral experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20169\">THERAPIST: And what is the background of the other people who are doing it differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016B\">CLIENT: Probably not years and years of choral experience. And there\u2019s a\u2026 I guess they just sort of think oh, it would be fun to do x but it\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to\u2026 I think one where they just kept on changing the syllables when the whole point of it was to be testing speed and I guess faster and faster. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2016B1\">And it\u2019s just trying to combine too many things into one, and it\u2019s like that\u2019s not the point of this. So I guess it\u2019s sort of like they\u2019re coming from a perspective of oh, it would be fun to do x. [45:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so maybe people might have different goals of what\u2019s the point of the warm up. And for you it\u2019s very clearly about developing the range and letting your voice actually warm up, and maybe another interpretation that people are taking is let\u2019s play a little bit. Can you be more flexible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20171\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s the challenge. It\u2019s challenging you to be a little bit more flexible. What\u2019s the point of warming up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve completely forgotten about that aspect of [inaudible] and it\u2019s only been in the most recent past\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20175\">THERAPIST: That sometimes people do things that are more just for fun, or that challenges you to be flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20177\">CLIENT: That people do things for fun and randomly interrupt [inaudible] yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20179\">THERAPIST: I mean it\u2019s not a professional group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean I\u2019m not trying to get us to be professional. And I mean there\u2019s a reason why I haven\u2019t said anything about it to anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">THERAPIST: But I think the\u2026 you want to be able to enjoy your time there, and you\u2019re not going to be able to change the group. I mean there may be specific things that you can have an impact on but you\u2019re not going to change the entire group. So figuring out where you can be a little bit more flexible <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D1\">so that you can enjoy things, even when they\u2019re not done exactly the way you would have them be done, that\u2019s going to be the challenge. Because I do really want you to be able to enjoy the things that you get from it. I imagine you want to be able to enjoy your time there too. And so we need to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D2\">out what is in your power. And part of that might be learning how to tolerate things being done differently than you would do them and broadening\u2026 maybe not broadening your vocal range but broadening your tolerance. [47:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">CLIENT: Or if I could possibly do a class, like this is how to do a warm-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">THERAPIST: You want to change them; you don\u2019t want you to be changed at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">CLIENT: Yes, I mean warm-up [inaudible] is just like picking random notes and\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not warming us up. It\u2019s not what the group expects and it makes it, I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 I can\u2019t really explain why it\u2019s wrong but it is. And then I don\u2019t always feel, then, like I\u2019ve actually gotten warmed <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201831\">up, which is an actual problem. I don\u2019t know if I can just make myself be more flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20182-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20182-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20185\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to increase your flexibility. It\u2019s also hard to make other people change when they don\u2019t want to. You have to see where\u2026 which side you want to push on. [48:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20187\">CLIENT: But I mean some of them might not actually know what a warm up is supposed to do, which is why I would consider doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so that might be something you can look for, right. So it\u2019s not impossible for people to change; it is\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say impossible because nothing\u2019s really impossible, but it is very difficult and not likely to get people to change if they don\u2019t want to. Now figuring out if maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201891\">there are people that are open to hearing your ideas and then hearing your ideas, in that case, might actually have real impact. There may be people who are not open to that and see the process as something different than what you see it as, and that they might be okay with sometimes not having a real <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201892\">vocal warm-up but just playing. So I think figuring out where there are openings, you push on the openings, and then where there\u2026 if there isn\u2019t an opening then the\u2026 any shift in your enjoyment has to come from your shift. So we\u2019ll have to see what\u2019s available to you really. So we have to stop for today. [49:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018B\">CLIENT: Okay.

How are you today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Doing okay. I think I\u2019m going to do dancing two nights a week instead of three.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Because I\u2019m not sure that three is sustainable, and so far I\u2019ve been making two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: That seems realistic then, noticing what\u2019s happening and base it on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s actually enough but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s a difference, so I think looking at the changes that you make in your life, kind of figuring out what they do for you, rather than whether it\u2019s enough or not enough. Did you enjoy it? [1:05]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s really important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve gotten better at walking so it\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: The weather change this weekend probably helped with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, well I meant more that when I walk it doesn\u2019t hurt sort of thing, because before my lower back would hurt pretty soon. If I carry too much it still sometimes happens, but I\u2019ve been not hurting most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so if you think about what\u2026 basing what you do and noticing what changes it\u2019s making, I know that you want to lose weight but also noticing things like having more mobility, having more fun. You were feeling pretty isolated, so dancing is something that helps decrease that. You\u2019re just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">out seeing more people. Those things are all positive changes for you in the week. And if it also helps you to control your weight, that\u2019s great. If there are other things you need to do in order to achieve that goal, then we might find that that\u2019s the case. But I think looking at your overall health <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">in terms of both your medical health and your\u2026 your physical health and your mental health, you\u2019ve got to look at sort of what are the things you\u2019re doing and how are they affecting you. [2:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah, and today after this appointment I\u2019m getting together with a friend and knitting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: So yeah, I\u2019ve\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: When did you reach out for that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well we were originally going to meet last week but then things came up, so I guess about a week and a half ago. But yeah, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still\u2026 I\u2019m trying to\u2026 I think I might be eating less but I\u2019m not\u2026 still not doing the whole getting all my vegetables in and stuff. And still been doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">a lot of ordering take out just because I\u2026 neither Sydney nor I usually feel like cooking or doing all the dishes and stuff. And he had made mac and cheese and there were a lot of dishes with that that we still haven\u2019t actually got into because he said he\u2019d do them, and he hasn\u2019t done them yet, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s a hard routine to break. [3:32]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, because I don\u2019t want\u2026 because often it ends up, then, that I end up doing the dishes, but if he says he\u2019ll do them, I should let him do them. But then again, if they don\u2019t get done after a certain time then they need to be done. So I\u2019m not sure what\u2026 there\u2019s not really good compromise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s your time frame?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Well I guess my time frame is before the next time that I want to cook something. And we\u2019ve just been extending that by going out or ordering in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so you\u2019re giving it a good long time it sounds like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean he\u2019s been freaking out because today, actually right now, he had his job interview and it was a technical interview. And before he was freaking out and I didn\u2019t know why, and I thought it was just his normal oh no, it\u2019s something happening; it\u2019s important, therefore I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">to have a panic attack. And I was being sort of unsympathetic because I was just kind of pissed off because here he is having a job interview and I haven\u2019t heard back from many people. And I\u2019m actually out applying for jobs and if I had an interview I\u2019d be happy. When I talked to him yesterday I finally <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">figured out it was because he hadn\u2019t been programming for the past two years since he\u2019s been unemployed, and it\u2019s they\u2019re going to ask him programming questions and he didn\u2019t feel ready for it. So then I was more sympathetic because that actually makes sense. And I thought it was more like a talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B3\">about what you do kind of, like the interviews that I have. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so he wasn\u2019t feeling qualified. [5:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he had\u2026 he\u2019d been programming. Had he not been unemployed for the past two years he would\u2019ve been able to do it with no problem, but he wasn\u2019t feeling ready. Then again he was also shooting himself in the foot by\u2026 well I guess he only had a few days to prepare because\u2026 okay, so he had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">talked to the recruiter a while ago and he had put off that talk for a while because he had gotten really sick with the bronchitis. Then he finally did talk to them\u2026 her, and she was like okay, we need to set up an interview with the actual interviewers, here\u2019s a bunch of questions that you need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F2\">fill out. And he stalled on that and finally got it back. And then for at least\u2026 it took him a couple of weeks after talking to the recruiter just to send that in. And then\u2026 or either that or\u2026 there was some step that he took two weeks to get back to them, or more than two weeks even. And then he didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F3\">hear back from them until we thought okay, well he took too long. I guess that means they\u2019re not interested anymore. And then they finally got back to him on Thursday with the interview slot for Monday, giving him three days to prepare. And had he known they were still actively considering him he would\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F4\">been preparing the whole time, but then since he only had the weekend he didn\u2019t prepare at all. He might still be fine but he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s going to be fine, so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, I hope that it goes well for him. [7:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean the whole thing. The job is in Florida so he\u2019s not sure he\u2019d even want it anyway. Facebook does have the office in Boston for their telecommuters but this is a job probably working with their servers, which he\u2019d have to be physically present there. So he\u2019s not even sure that he wants it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: How do you feel?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know because the thing is, if he\u2026 because he\u2019d only accept it if he had enough for both of us to live off of in Florida. So I think\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a long shot that he\u2019ll get it. I do think it would be a long shot that he\u2019d get it and it would be enough <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">that he\u2019d actually take it, and even then I\u2026 he\u2019s still pretty depressed and still hasn\u2019t gotten\u2026 his psychiatrist still hasn\u2019t gotten back to him, and he is on no anti-anxiety meds and so I don\u2019t even know. Maybe working would be good for him and make him feel better, but I don\u2019t know whether or not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">he\u2019s at the point where he could hold down a job. So yeah, I mean I\u2019m hoping he does well so that way it\u2019s his choice whether or not he wants to take the job, but yeah, I don\u2019t know how hard the questions are going to be that they ask him.

And I mean I guess I\u2019m\u2026 I mean it hasn\u2019t been\u2026 I haven\u2019t been looking for jobs that much. Last week I didn\u2019t\u2026 I mean I didn\u2019t check all the sites but I checked some of the sites, and the ones that I did I didn\u2019t find anything that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">could apply to, so this\u2026 I guess this is now my third week of unemployment and so far I\u2019ve applied to jobs one of those three weeks. But then again, this week has only just started so I guess I\u2019ve only missed one week of applying to things. But still\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: What stopped you from checking all of your typical sites last week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, I guess because I was just\u2026 I really don\u2019t know, possibly forgetting about the other ones.

And then when I thought of it I was already out of the okay, I\u2019ll try to find things and apply to them mode, and it was just like yeah, whatever, which I shouldn\u2019t have done because if I had found something I could\u2019ve always just bookmarked it and looked at it later. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">But I guess now I can always go back and look at everything because it\u2019s probably not going to make that much of a difference if it\u2019s a few days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: And kind of setting up a routine for yourself of when you check, where you look, so you can get back in that rhythm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is harder than if I have to set up a routine of okay, this is when I apply for jobs, then what happens if I get to that time and I don\u2019t feel like it.

And I think at this point looking for jobs <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">and applying for reasonable jobs is something you need to do. That\u2019s one of your responsibilities as somebody who has an apartment, has college degrees, has graduate degrees. Your parents are expecting it of you. So there\u2019s a difference between being unable to do something and not wanting to do something. [11:40]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah, just like it was the same thing with writing papers in college, in grad school. If I was\u2026 I guess these periods also came more often then, but there were periods that I was like okay, I\u2019m totally writing this paper, would write tons of things, and it would be really, really good. And then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">there were times that I had to write a paper and wasn\u2019t feeling it and getting any sentence was like pulling teeth. It was just not coming out of me. And it\u2019s the same thing with cover letters except it\u2019s even worse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because you\u2019re not really\u2026 I mean [inaudible] writing papers. You may have had something that you were\u2026 a topic that you were interested in.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, or at least I could\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Whereas cover letters feel pretty dry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, especially because it was so much easier when I actually had things to talk about, like sources and proving points, and a cover letter\u2019s not like that at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right, so they\u2019re\u2026 it seems less likely that sort of design\u2026 divine inspiration to write is not going to come as much for job applications as it does, or as it did, for papers that you might be interested in. So your bar for what you push through has to be a little bit different. [13:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean they\u2019re\u2026 because the ones that I wrote two weeks ago I did have a period of oh, I can totally do this. And I still get it. Yesterday we\u2026 Sydney helped me and we actually took out all the trash and recycling. I willed myself to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: How did you feel when you were done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: A lot better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so looking forward to that feeling, whether it\u2019s relief or pride or accomplishment, that whatever that better was, knowing that that might follow. So it might not feel good when you get started but there is that positive feeling at the end for having done something that you know is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">on that list of things that you just do as a responsible adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just really hard with cover letters because you can push yourself to do the dishes; you don\u2019t have to think to do the dishes. I\u2019m just hoping I can get back to the point where writing cover letters doesn\u2019t actually require thinking either. [14:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Do you have copies on your computer of the ones you\u2019ve written before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes, every single one of them. And I keep them all in one folder. And the resumes I update and put a date on the\u2026 and then I have everything sorted by date so I can go back and be like okay, at this point in time I was applying for these kinds of jobs. Let me look and see what I wrote in them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">But the problem, I guess, is also now it\u2019s very different, what I\u2019m writing. So I have to start all over again. I can\u2019t just recycle stuff from my old cover letters because I had this job for a year and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Right, so you have to kind of\u2026 well but you\u2019ve applied to something since then, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Mm-hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: A couple of things. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: But none of them have had cover letters that I\u2019ve considered particularly good yet. So I mean I can use stuff from them\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: Pieces maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: But if they all are like pieces of sucky cover letters then I just send out more sucky cover letters. Then I\u2019m sending out sucky cover letters. And then does that even really count as sending out cover letters if they\u2019re not going to get me anything. And maybe they\u2019re not as bad as I think they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">are but they\u2019re not particularly\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so subjective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: \u2026 good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: I mean you certainly don\u2019t get anything by not sending out one. [16:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well no, not quite. Because then I still have the potential to send one out and possibly send out a good one. If I sent out one that\u2019s bad then I can\u2019t send out another one for that job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: So by\u2026 if they\u2019re\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: How long do the jobs that are posted in your field typically stay open?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Usually at least a couple of weeks. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2026 it depends on\u2026 sometimes they even give you a closing date. The ones that I had applied for two weeks ago, at that time it had been three weeks since they had been posted but the postings were still up, so I was like does it mean that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">I would still have a chance for them maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: So knowing that they typically stay up for a couple of weeks gives you a time limit for your thinking of how long can you wait before deciding to send out something that feels okay but not great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: I mean and even\u2026 it\u2019s probably been more, that was just when I applied to it. They probably stay up for at least a month, usually, if not more. It just\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether they might, just on that first day, take those cover letters and not read ones that come in after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Or they might read them all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Right. I mean they may be slow to take down a posting or maybe they really are staying open to new applicants as long as the posting\u2019s up. But I think at least giving yourself sort of a time limit, because you\u2019re right. I guess you can wait and see if a better cover letter will sort of come <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">to you, but if you miss that window\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I mean usually if I write one that I\u2019m not too happy with but I think it\u2019s okay, I end up sending it out. So usually it\u2019s between thinking I\u2019ll write a bad one and not doing it or feeling like I\u2019m at a point that I can force myself to do it. And very rarely is it oh I feel like I\u2019m going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">totally write an awesome cover letter for this today. And yeah, when the jobs are more generic it makes it harder to send out something good, and if I\u2019m applying for a billion jobs at Yale, if I should be talking about how awesome it would be to work at Yale and stuff, you can only say that so many <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">ways before you get really, really repetitive. I mean sometimes I can talk about the different subdivisions but it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But if you\u2019re applying, I mean it\u2019s going to be repetitive because it\u2019s a cover letter. [18:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: And if the same people are then reading those same cover letters [inaudible] I don\u2019t want to make it sound like I copy everything from my other cover letters, but I run out of things to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Right, because it\u2019s a very limited\u2026 there\u2019s a very limited set of things that you\u2019re going to say in a cover letter. I mean you\u2019re going to talk about why you want to work at the place and why you\u2019d be a good fit for the job. And if the place is Yale and you\u2019re going to talk about why you <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">want to work at Yale, you don\u2019t have a lot of room to be super creative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: I guess then at that point I could recycle things outright.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think for things that fit it\u2019s okay to be recycling things because this isn\u2019t a paper. Original thought is not, and creative interpretation is not, really the goal of this type of writing. This is very specific highlighting your skills. I want to work for you and you want me to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">for you for these reasons. Everybody\u2019s kind of writing similar things. It\u2019s hard to get really creative. And you want to stand out based on your unique fit rather than something really zany and creative in your cover letter. [20:17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. And I\u2026 yeah, because if you do something gimmicky it will show and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: And not for your field of work. If you were applying to be in some sort of art teacher position, maybe doing something zany and creative would be fabulous. But it doesn\u2019t seem like a fit for the types of job that you\u2019re typically applying for. So it seems like really your task is to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">out how to get motivated to look at what\u2019s out there so the opportunities don\u2019t pass you by, and how to motivate yourself to then sit down and start the process of producing the cover letters and the resume for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I mean I guess one thing I could do is sort of make watching a show on TV or listening to a podcast contingent on finishing a cover letter, which actually sometimes I\u2019ve done. Or like Sydney might\u2019ve already started listening to something and so it\u2019s on, but I\u2019m not really paying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">attention to it until I finish my cover letter because I can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: So that might be a way to do it. I mean and getting\u2026 I was thinking about a routine in terms of just getting into a rhythm of your day. Maybe you start the day by what would get you ready to sit down and do some of this work. [21:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: I mean I guess having eaten already and showered and stuff and having some time to Internet at first. It\u2019s just hard to then cut off that Interneting and\u2026 before I write something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Would it make more sense to make playing on the Internet the reward?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Except then I\u2019m like oh, I can totally multitask and look\u2026 I mean I guess if I only allowed myself a set 20 minutes or something like that before I started working that could do it. The other thing is that I\u2019m still having trouble with the whole getting a normal sleep schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: What was your sleep like this week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: I think\u2026 well for most of the time we were staying up more until one than two, so it\u2019s an improvement, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And then what time are you waking up in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">CLIENT: Ten, eleven. This morning I actually\u2026 we\u2026 because Sydney had the interview we were going to go out for breakfast and stuff early, and I woke up at nine and I just could not get up. So I set an alarm for ten and then I couldn\u2019t really get up so I set an alarm for 10:45 and then I\u2026 yeah, at ten <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF1\">I tried to wake up Sydney. I was hoping he would get up and then that I could go back to sleep and he could wake me up after he\u2019d showered or something. But that\u2019s also why I sent that 10:45 alarm, and then we both ended up going back to sleep. And I mean I guess we went to bed at\u2026 it was like 12:45. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF2\">It wasn\u2019t that late. I had got more than eight hours sleep but I was just having so much trouble, and I wasn\u2019t even\u2026 because sometimes it\u2019s like I have a really good dream or something and I\u2019m like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to face the outside world, I want to go back to this dream, I\u2019ll give myself another hour\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF3\">sleep. But this morning I was just so tired I could not get up. And I don\u2019t know, I mean I\u2019m feeling a little bit sick today and so I don\u2019t know if that has something to do with it, but it was just really frustrating. [24:20]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">THERAPIST: So last night you went to bed around one. What have the other nights been like? Is it similar or are you all over the place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: Well yeah, it\u2019s sort of all over the place. I think there might have been one night that we actually got to bed early because I\u2026 yeah, we got to bed early on Friday night since I had my game on Saturday and that was starting at one, so I wanted to have time to get breakfast beforehand. And so <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">yeah, that time I went to bed early. But the rest of the nights it\u2019s been late. Yeah, sometimes\u2026 because I went swing dancing on Wednesday night. I got back from that like 11:30 and then stayed up for awhile. And then on Saturday night I went contra dancing, got back from that at like 11:00, but then <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">Sydney was out with friends. And he got back from that more around 12:00. Then we stayed up for another two hours after that. And I\u2019d been wanting to go to bed but it took a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: So the inconsistency plus we had the time change this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah, the time change definitely did not help. [25:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Sometimes that can really kind of alter people\u2019s sleep schedules a bit. So I think one thing that makes it hard if you\u2019re not having a consistent pattern of when you go to sleep and when you wake up, your circadian rhythm is irregular as well. And the pattern of going to bed at a fairly similar <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C91\">time, waking up at a fairly similar time so that your sleep cycles can regulate to the amount of time that you typically sleep, that makes it easier to wake up. Throughout the night we go through several 90-minute sleep cycles, and it\u2019s easier to wake up as\u2026 in between a cycle rather than in the middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C92\">of one. And if you sleep for the same amount of time every night, approximately, if you typically sleep eight hours or typically sleep ten, your body adjusts so that it kind of knows when you\u2019re going to wake up. So your sleep cycle kind of matches what your wake up time is. So with inconsistency your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C93\">body has no idea what\u2019s going on or what\u2026 or when you\u2019re\u2026 when it should be ready to wake up. So I think that might be partly why it\u2019s sometimes really hard to get yourself to get up even though you\u2019ve had more than eight hours of sleep. Well your body didn\u2019t know what to expect. Was it getting eight <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C94\">that night, was it getting ten, was it getting up at eight in the morning or eleven in the morning. It\u2019s a big difference. [26:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Well actually this morning I realized that I did wake up before my alarm; I just couldn\u2019t get out of bed and get up. I mean I got out of bed to go to the bathroom and then I went back to sleep. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I think your goal is just to try to be a little more consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: How consistent is consistent? Is it\u2026 if it\u2019s within an hour is it okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s probably close enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s unrealistic to expect that you\u2019re going to go to bed at 11:15 on the dot every night. And you don\u2019t need to strive for that. But there\u2019s a big difference between going to bed at 11:45 and 2:00. So I think trying to go to bed within an hour, picking an hour, and then seeing if you can\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D51\">and make one that\u2019s reasonable. If you know that you\u2019re going to want to be doing these dancing things a couple of nights a week, and that means you\u2019re not getting home until 11 or 11:30 at night, then don\u2019t pick 11 as your bedtime because that\u2019s going to be hard for you to stick with. So pay attention <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D52\">to what\u2019s actually going on, pick something that seems reasonable with that, and practice trying to see if you can arrange your bedtime to be within an hour of each other. That would be closer than what you\u2019re doing now.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. [28:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: So I think we\u2019ve got to work with what\u2019s realistic rather than what would be super ideal. And then the same thing goes for waking up. Waking up at a consistent time is almost more important than going to bed at consistent time because that\u2019s the part that you don\u2019t have as much control over, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">right? You can pick when you go to bed. You don\u2019t have control over when your body wakes up naturally. You set your alarm but that doesn\u2019t impact what your\u2026 where your sleep cycle is. But if you consistently wake up around the same time then your sleep cycles will naturally regulate to that time. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D92\">that\u2019s what you want, so that when your\u2026 so that your body\u2019s ready to wake up when your alarm says so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it\u2019s been really hard to do that. I keep on falling into that trap. I guess today it was just so much worse than it usually is. I mean yesterday I got up pretty late too, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: That might be partly because of the time change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: It was the time change. I ended up getting up at noon. We went to bed at I guess what was almost two but then was almost three with the time change. And then I don\u2019t think I set an alarm. And yeah, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, my body\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">THERAPIST: So see what you can do in terms of the things that you can control. It\u2019s going to take probably a couple of days for your body to get used to the time change. And at the same time you\u2019re kind of responding to the fact that you\u2019ve had sort of an erratic pattern of when you go to bed and wake <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E11\">up. So if it\u2019s important to you and you can control the factors of when you go to bed and when you set your alarm\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">CLIENT: Well I guess\u2026 is it possible that my body just needs more sleep? I thought that eight hours is normal. [30:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Eight to ten is all considered normal needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: At least I\u2019m finally sleeping through the night again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that makes a big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: I think\u2026 yeah, it mostly started after my job ended. And I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with the job. I don\u2019t think it did, other than I guess the\u2026 now I\u2019m actually going to get a walk in now that I don\u2019t have my job anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: And that can help regulate sleep. So sleeping a little bit deeper at night, sleeping through the night because you\u2019re walking. Exercise can really help with that, too, because your body\u2019s actually physically tired enough to sleep through the night. And then you get a better rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: You mean even if I\u2019m not getting exercise every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Every day would be ideal. Some days is better than nothing, right? So I mean it\u2019s not all or nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: I got exercise last night, too, because\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Dancing, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: That was Saturday night. Last night I had rehearsal and I walked to the subway, which was about a ten-minute walk, and then it\u2019s another ten minutes or so from the subway to the room where we rehearse. [31:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so that\u2019s 20 minutes of walking. So I mean your body doesn\u2019t count some exercise and not others. Even if it\u2019s in little chunks it\u2019s still\u2026 it still has a positive impact on you and it can impact so many things. How did it feel to be at rehearsal again [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: It felt good. I don\u2019t know, I find myself irrationally getting annoyed at some things that people do during rehearsal that aren\u2019t actually bad things that\u2026 not that I ever said anything about it but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: What kinds of things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: How much do you know about singing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">THERAPIST: Very little. So singing things are annoying you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah, so people interrupting in the middle or singing the wrong thing because we do scale going up and then the person who\u2019s playing it will play the note and then the next\u2026 that we ended on, then the next note. And then someone was also singing that for no good reason and the person on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201031\">piano was\u2026 and that just bothered me and I don\u2019t know why. And then\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: So people kind of not following the rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah, people just\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Singer etiquette. [32:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: \u2026butt into [inaudible] It didn\u2019t used to be this way but in the past couple of years [inaudible] or usually Jack will sing random things all the time and sometimes when it\u2019s between\u2026 when they\u2019ve given us the note and when we\u2019re about to sing what we\u2019re supposed to sing. That\u2026 then it\u2019s really <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B1\">distracting because\u2026 and that\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I should speak up but he really shouldn\u2019t be doing\u2026 we definitely, at one point, have been told you should not sing between giving the notes and when starting to sing because otherwise that will throw other people off with their notes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it feels disrespectful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: And then another one that I just got annoyed\u2026 so we were singing a song that\u2026 I had been alto forever and switched to tenor because they needed a tenor. And so the tenor they split into two parts. There\u2019s\u2026 because it goes low and high. And so they have one person singing lower notes and two <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F1\">of us singing the upper notes. So the person giving\u2026 and the lower note comes first and so the person giving the starting notes give the bass starting note and the low tenor starting note but not the high tenor starting note. And I asked if I could have a starting note but then she kept on playing it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F2\">over and over again and I\u2019m like no, I just wanted a starting note. And for some reason that\u2026 I guess just because\u2026 then I felt like it was like oh, she doesn\u2019t think I can sing it myself or something. But I\u2019m just like no, I just want a starting note like everyone else has a starting note. But if there <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F3\">was a little [inaudible] of her to actually control my annoyance and I don\u2019t know what that was. [34:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: So on a scale of one to ten, how annoyed do these things make you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Maybe three to five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: So low to medium?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: Does that feel appropriate to you? As you sit here removed from the situation, does it feel like an appropriate amount of annoyance for the situation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: Probably not for the lower one. I\u2026 yeah, I guess it\u2026 not quite, yeah. So I don\u2019t know what the deal is, why I get overly annoyed at these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Well what does it mean\u2026 what kind of meaning do you attach to their\u2026 the behavior of the people interrupting, or the girl misunderstanding what you were asking for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Well the interrupting, I\u2019m not really sure. I don\u2019t really place much meaning on it; it\u2019s just people doing their own thing and not paying attention to warm ups or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20121\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s the meaning you attach, that they\u2019re not paying attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20123\">CLIENT: Yeah, or just trying to railroad it, like do their own thing. And it\u2019s like you are not the one leading warm-ups; stop doing that. Even though I\u2019m not the one leading warm-ups. But I want my warm-ups to be led by one person and not by several people. And you shouldn\u2019t just get to sing something <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201231\">and make everybody else sing it when you\u2019re not leading warm-ups. That\u2019s not how rehearsal works. [36:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it\u2019s bumping up your\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 that behavior is sort of bumping up your\u2026 bumping up against your belief that this should be done a certain way, and nobody should interfere with it. So sometimes even just recognizing it. What is it that\u2019s really frustrating you. It\u2019s frustrating you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201251\">that\u2026 or angering you, maybe more appropriately, if it\u2019s a five, that people are breaking the rules that you\u2019re adhering to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s not like I think it\u2019s unfair or anything like that. It\u2019s just annoying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s annoying that people aren\u2019t following the rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: But there\u2019s absolutely nothing I can do about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s not your job to enforce the rules, right. You\u2019re not in charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: I mean it\u2019s as if you had no one enforcing them because they all think it\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: So are you the only one that\u2019s bothered by it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: I mean I haven\u2019t\u2026 because it\u2019s such a minor thing that I don\u2019t feel justified being annoyed by it, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone about it. So I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m the only one bothered by it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: How does the rest of practice go for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: The rest of practice is usually fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: So would keeping that in perspective help you to let go of your feeling that the warm-up is a fairly small portion of the night, and the other part\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s not just that I\u2026 Jack butting in and singing random things isn\u2019t just warm-ups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Oh, that\u2019s not just the warm-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: It\u2019ll be one where anytime we\u2019re in between runs or the song or anything like that. That\u2019s all the time. I mean he won\u2019t do it in the middle of a song.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: So what do you do in between songs? Or what do other people do? [38:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: Talk to each other. That\u2019s pretty much what the rest of the group does. Or we\u2019re discussing how it went and what needs to be changed and stuff like that. Well I guess the other thing that I also get annoyed is, I guess she does it on all the parts, but when we\u2019re learning new parts Cam usually <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201431\">likes to sing along with it. I guess I just feel like when she does that it feels like she doesn\u2019t think I can handle the part myself, which I guess it\u2019s not that I think\u2026 it\u2019s probably that she just wants to learn all the parts. But because we do sometimes have\u2026 okay, every\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20145\">THERAPIST: Who\u2019s Cam?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">CLIENT: She\u2019s one of the people in the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">CLIENT: And yeah, she\u2019s president right now. She\u2019s the only one who does that. But sometimes they\u2019ll have everyone sing the bass part, but that\u2019s usually because the basses probably can\u2019t get it on their own. We\u2026 I mean I guess sometimes I\u2019ll have everyone sing\u2026 like Kempsey [sp?] had everyone sing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B1\">to increase sight reading, but nowadays it\u2019s usually just people in their parts singing the part. And yeah, it feels like she doesn\u2019t think we can get it ourselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014D\">THERAPIST: And that probably leads you to feel bad [inaudible] interpreting it that way, that she thinks we can\u2019t get this on our own. [39:52]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah, and actually last night with the tenor part, Thomas had been on the lower tenor part and then he switched over to mine midway through the song. And I\u2026 afterwards he was like oh yeah, I decided to switch because I realized that the tenor, the lower part, was echoing the basses, so we need <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2014F1\">more people on the upper part. But during the time I was like wait, is he singing this now because I\u2019m singing it wrong, which is what I thought it was so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20151\">THERAPIST: So the self-doubt thoughts or the\u2026 or a feeling like people are judging you and not trusting your abilities, those can really make you feel badly. So when\u2026 so I think it\u2019s important to recognize how you\u2019re interpreting what people are doing because if you\u2019re interpreting it in a way that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201511\">going to lead you to feel defensive or badly then you need to find another interpretation. Or leave it without interpretation, right. Because in that case you found out that oh, it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t feel\u2026 think you were doing a good enough job, it was completely unrelated to you at all. And it <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201512\">might be that Cam is unrelated to you wanting to learn all the parts because she\u2019s president and feels that she should have a handle on everybody\u2019s part. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20153\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because she\u2019s president, but I think it\u2019s just because she wants to learn all the parts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20155\">THERAPIST: But again\u2026 but\u2026 so that\u2019s a benign interpretation, whether it\u2019s because she wants to learn all the parts just because that\u2019s who she is. But coming up with interpretation for things that don\u2019t make you feel badly, whether it\u2019s angry or upset. When you don\u2019t know it doesn\u2019t do you any good <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201551\">to come up with an interpretation that makes you feel bad. Until you can check in about something, see if you can come up with an interpretation that\u2019s neutral, like oh, Cam just likes to learn them all, or so and so\u2019s easily bored in between sets so he sings his own thing. [41:54]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess it just gets annoying and repetitive. It\u2019s like maybe he\u2019s sometimes doing it to be funny and after you do it the hundredth time it\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20159\">THERAPIST: \u2026ceases to be funny. And you\u2026 maybe you could lead with that. Oh, yeah, this has now ceased to be funny. Without getting as invested in response to it. And the purpose of trying to not get really vested in the response is not to give him a break but give you a break from feeling maybe more <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201591\">upset than makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I just wish all the decorum around warm-ups hadn\u2019t completely disappeared but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I can see that it\u2026 not taking it seriously bothers you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F\">CLIENT: It just\u2026 and if it were people just like talking in between or something like that, that probably wouldn\u2019t bother me as much as actively trying to sing something and be okay, where\u2019s [inaudible] when you\u2019re not the one leading it. Also, sometimes [inaudible] Jack sings something weird and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F1\">we do end up singing it, and it\u2019s something that isn\u2019t actually [inaudible] because the syllables are hard to sing or something like that. Because it\u2019s like okay, pick a random sentence and sing that. And that\u2019s not how you should be warming up. It should be things that allow the voice to get to its <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2015F2\">maximum range and stuff.

And it\u2019s just like no one knows how warm-ups work anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20165\">THERAPIST: Where did you learn about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20167\">CLIENT: I was in choir for all of high school and some of middle school, but four years of\u2026 two of those years were\u2026 was in the special audition choir. Then even\u2026 and also then [inaudible] used to have warm-up\u2026 do normal warm-ups. And so years and years of choral experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20169\">THERAPIST: And what is the background of the other people who are doing it differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016B\">CLIENT: Probably not years and years of choral experience. And there\u2019s a\u2026 I guess they just sort of think oh, it would be fun to do x but it\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to\u2026 I think one where they just kept on changing the syllables when the whole point of it was to be testing speed and I guess faster and faster. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2016B1\">And it\u2019s just trying to combine too many things into one, and it\u2019s like that\u2019s not the point of this. So I guess it\u2019s sort of like they\u2019re coming from a perspective of oh, it would be fun to do x. [45:15]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so maybe people might have different goals of what\u2019s the point of the warm up. And for you it\u2019s very clearly about developing the range and letting your voice actually warm up, and maybe another interpretation that people are taking is let\u2019s play a little bit. Can you be more flexible?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2016F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20171\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s the challenge. It\u2019s challenging you to be a little bit more flexible. What\u2019s the point of warming up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20173\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve completely forgotten about that aspect of [inaudible] and it\u2019s only been in the most recent past\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20175\">THERAPIST: That sometimes people do things that are more just for fun, or that challenges you to be flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20177\">CLIENT: That people do things for fun and randomly interrupt [inaudible] yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20179\">THERAPIST: I mean it\u2019s not a professional group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean I\u2019m not trying to get us to be professional. And I mean there\u2019s a reason why I haven\u2019t said anything about it to anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D\">THERAPIST: But I think the\u2026 you want to be able to enjoy your time there, and you\u2019re not going to be able to change the group. I mean there may be specific things that you can have an impact on but you\u2019re not going to change the entire group. So figuring out where you can be a little bit more flexible <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D1\">so that you can enjoy things, even when they\u2019re not done exactly the way you would have them be done, that\u2019s going to be the challenge. Because I do really want you to be able to enjoy the things that you get from it. I imagine you want to be able to enjoy your time there too. And so we need to figure <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2017D2\">out what is in your power. And part of that might be learning how to tolerate things being done differently than you would do them and broadening\u2026 maybe not broadening your vocal range but broadening your tolerance. [47:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2017F\">CLIENT: Or if I could possibly do a class, like this is how to do a warm-up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20181\">THERAPIST: You want to change them; you don\u2019t want you to be changed at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20183\">CLIENT: Yes, I mean warm-up [inaudible] is just like picking random notes and\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not warming us up. It\u2019s not what the group expects and it makes it, I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026 I can\u2019t really explain why it\u2019s wrong but it is. And then I don\u2019t always feel, then, like I\u2019ve actually gotten warmed <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201831\">up, which is an actual problem. I don\u2019t know if I can just make myself be more flexible.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20182-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20182-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561893\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20185\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to increase your flexibility. It\u2019s also hard to make other people change when they don\u2019t want to. You have to see where\u2026 which side you want to push on. [48:31]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20187\">CLIENT: But I mean some of them might not actually know what a warm up is supposed to do, which is why I would consider doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20189\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so that might be something you can look for, right. So it\u2019s not impossible for people to change; it is\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say impossible because nothing\u2019s really impossible, but it is very difficult and not likely to get people to change if they don\u2019t want to. Now figuring out if maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201891\">there are people that are open to hearing your ideas and then hearing your ideas, in that case, might actually have real impact. There may be people who are not open to that and see the process as something different than what you see it as, and that they might be okay with sometimes not having a real <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N201892\">vocal warm-up but just playing. So I think figuring out where there are openings, you push on the openings, and then where there\u2026 if there isn\u2019t an opening then the\u2026 any shift in your enjoyment has to come from your shift. So we\u2019ll have to see what\u2019s available to you really. So we have to stop for today. [49:41]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2018B\">CLIENT: Okay.

And you said no on the 31st.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20193\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20195\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20197\">CLIENT: I\u2019m going to write you a check now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20199\">THERAPIST: And then maybe next week we can also talk about\u2026 I know Passover\u2019s coming up in April.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2019B\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.
