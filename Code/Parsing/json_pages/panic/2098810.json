I was thinking as I was walking home on Friday the thing about a [lonely being] (ph), I didn't really ever consciously think she doesn't want me. What I thought and what was really difficult for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">me, or one of the things that was really difficult, was feeling, burning with absolute certainty was what I wanted didn't matter at all; that it was not going to be taken into account. So, I mean from that perspective, the story of about [inaudible at 00:01:22] at camp it's like no, that wasn't about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">me choosing anything. In some part it was I wanted to be with my mom. I was getting some kind of conciliation prize and it wasn't really very much. I wanted to be at a different school, I didn't want to be at no (ph) and it just didn't matter to anybody. I wanted to be in different classes and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D3\">was ended. Even now I don't want to be working on [inaudible at 00:02:25] and it feels like I don't have a choice. I wanted to be in [inaudible at 00:02:44]; that doesn't seem to make a difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: You like to not be working?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I just wanted to get a life. I don't think I wanted that. I want to be doing I feel like I need to be working, to be doing something but I don't know what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You think you really want to be dead?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I think so. I mean, really I just want my life not to suck but I don't see that as a reasonable possibility. I want not to be suffering so much, but I don't see how to make that happen. Yeah. I would rather be dead than [inaudible 00:04:18]; watch [inaudible] time in life. [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: So, if I'm understanding you right, the things we've been talking about to do with your mother and what that has made you think of about what you sort of wanted or needed not mattering not much at all and really not being, well, recognized really even, let alone seriously taken into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes. I told people what I wanted -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yes, and how did that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: And they kind of nodded and listened and said okay and then it just didn't happen. And there wasn't even any like admission that yes, I had wanted this and I wasn't getting it. It was like I hadn't spoken. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I imagine it sometimes feels that same way when you talk about wanting to die that when there's (ph) people around when you're talking about whatever (ph), but not much happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. The only other person that I talk to about it is James. I don't talk to him about much. I mean I have more and more [inaudible]. And what's inside of me, I know, I'm sorry, and I'm making it up to him, which is something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: When you said I mean, I asked if this is what you wanted and you said [at that point] (ph) you would ask for your life not to suck, but you don't see that doesn't seem possible. So I guess that that would be like a little like with school, wanting things in your classroom to be better <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">but not being that a real possibility and so just wanting to be somewhere else as a kind of tactical <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yes, I want people to like me but that wasn't consistent (ph). I wanted people to care whether I was there or not and they just really didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098810\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Yes, you wanted to [inaudible at 00:09:16], which is not how things are now I gather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes. It's it felt like kind of like I was hallucinating; it felt real bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yesterday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Tell me about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Just it's just all of the choices that I have seems just impossible to do they were so hard. And it felt like I would die if I went into work. I didn't think it sort of felt like I would die if I called in sick and felt like it would be better but also like it would be better for me to die. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">I was just like this cannot be my situation; this cannot be my life. But that is what it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">It was like I could, for most of the day I could kind of feel something really, really bad or I could feel about like it was going to be really, really painful at some point and I kept just kind of trying to cope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Like the shit was going to hit the fan?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yes, and at yes. And that's when I sort of broke and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I eventually just broke, the night before last. I got drunk with James; that was how he copes. It might not be the best coping mechanism but I don't think it's the worst. But that was what I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: That was fine, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: When did I'm sorry, my calendar's is all screwed up we talked on the phone, was that after Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I don't remember what I did. Oh, Saturday I went to [the chiropractor] (ph) early in the afternoon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I came home and sat there for about half an hour and then it's like yes, this isn't going to happen [inaudible at 00:12:13] this week or the next day early Sunday. And then I had to go to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yes, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: It's like I've been dodging feeling as bad and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: And this is the stuff that came up around your mother when she left?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: And we kind of jumped into it with both feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I don't think it's a major factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I wasn't expecting it to be like it was because it's not like I haven't thought about it and I mean we've talked about it before, just not at great length. And I think I told you before that I really wanted to move. But it was like I started thinking about it and I couldn't stop thinking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">it, and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Thinking about having wanted to [move on] (ph), how that would make a difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yes. And then started drawing analogies that may or may not actually be apt to the way I'm living now but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like there's not as much between the two of you or that there never was [inaudible at 00:13:57]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: No. Between the two...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: You and your mom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I guess I sort of imagined you in a kind of freefall over the last few days. Or I guess the bottom kind of dropped out in a way that you saw more clearly when she wasn't there for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yes, but it's when she wasn't there and when everybody wasn't there. It's like everybody sort of tried but nobody really quite cared enough. They cared enough to say use your therapist, but therapists don't call anybody at other times when my living situation wasn't good. And my dad didn't care <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">enough to not yell at me all the f***king time; school just didn't care at all; I don't know, I didn't care enough to fake [inaudible at 00:15:56]. It feels like when [inaudible] I tend to automatically think that what I want isn't very important and I got trained pretty specifically into thinking that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B2\">what I wanted wasn't very important because it was not treated as very important. And it's really hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098810\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: And it's started again, yes. I mean how long [inaudible] really mattered?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes, I think I must have worried about or felt like my mom didn't want me on some level because I never thought about her not wanting me but I thought very hard about other people not wanting me. I was very upset that I did not have friends and incredibly lonely in that regard. It felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F1\">I remember phrasing to myself that nobody cares whether I'm in the room or not; nobody would care if I left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: I wonder too about the therapist in some ways feeling like a proxy figure mom in that the feeling I get from it, at least in other words from you, is like it was kind of she put in an appearance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yes, I mean she was trying but she didn't know what I needed and I didn't know how to tell her. Yes. I remember the thing about her telling me oh, this is how you can avoid crying because that was something where that was exactly what I needed at that moment, that like how do I cope?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Because I would just burst into tears all the time and I couldn't stop it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Well you were so horribly sad and you were so horribly alone. Probably furious too but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes, definitely that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: and I think I appreciate how in a way what you did need was supplicated (ph) to tell you how to cope but you really needed somebody there with you, which you absolutely didn't in no way, shape or form have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: By that time, I mean by the time she said that, I was in seventh or eighth grade so I'd given up on that as even a possibility. Like, this is what's never going to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: You quit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes, but I didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: You're right. I completely agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: But by that point, I didn't think that people were all bad so I didn't care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Yes, I imagine you couldn't [inaudible at 00:20:29] function at all. I think another factor in this last few days is that I kind of left you with this on Friday and we haven't talked much since, I mean we've talked on the phone, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: It's hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I think the timing there sucked and maybe a little bit recapitulated some of it. Though, I would imagine a bit late [inaudible at 00:21:08], but neither of us even realizing, I don't think, the extent to which it had [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: No, it's one of those where it's like I don't blame you but I sort of need to blame somebody or something. It's hard but I'm here. I also finished the Infinite Jest, which is not the best idea ever but I needed to be done with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Why was it not the best idea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Oh because it didn't end in a satisfying way. So I [inaudible at 00:22:00] kind of poked around a little bit and got somebody else's opinion on this and read an article about, a very long article about David Foster Wallace, it was like a biography of his life and his depression, nearing his <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">biography of his work and what he was trying to do with it. So I found it a bit it ended in the way he'd want it to end but I wasn't missing anything. It just wasn't a satisfying conclusion and that actually made me feel much better about the book. I'm okay as long as I know it's not like some kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200932\">of clue he didn't [inaudible at 00:22:41], that this is what we're supposed to get. Yes, I was just thinking about all these things. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098810\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: How old is he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: He's 46. I should have I guess the one thing that I realized that is helpful is that when he writes about depression, he writes about it from the perspective of somebody who's totally in it. And the way that when I am completely in it, it feels like it has always been exactly this unendurable <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">and it is the same level of unendurable but that's not actually the case. I just don't, I don't think he had that distance ever. So I spent some time thinking through that. ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: And he I think truly despised therapy. So he's very funny writing about it and it's very kind of therapeutic for me, like oh my God somebody else is [saying this] (ph). I just don't know if he ever had a therapist who was smarter than he was, was the problem, or as smart as he was or could keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I'll go with or keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: A good therapist [inaudible at 00:24:46] keep up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: So he never trusted anybody else to know better than he did. So I'm working that card or smart or something. .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: What did he say that might help?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Oh God. Oh, there's this amazing scene in Infinite Jest where this poor kid who's trying to quit pot cold turkey and having a really tough time, asks for a reference to an AA meeting. And he goes to the one that's the farthest away where he's not going to know anybody. And he goes in and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A71\">takes him a while to get this out but it's not an AA meeting; it's a bunch of men sitting around holding teddy bears having a Nurturing the Inner Infant session. And there's this, oh God, I can't even describe it, it's too grotesque. But basically just he clearly thinks this kind of therapy, the Nurturing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A72\">of the Inner Infant, is A, stupid as f**k, and B, is exacerbating the feelings that they're talking about, that's like wallowing in how miserable you are rather than reaching for some kind of catharsis and it's making people more childish and more infantile and helpless. It was really funny, really funny. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">And the sadness is that this kid never gets to go to an AA meeting, misses this whole thing of support that's there. I don't know, I'm thinking, if that's actually autobiographical Wallace, but it sure feels like it's me. There is this support that could be there and didn't raise [inaudible at 00:27:30].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Are you thinking how that's familiar?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: I was more thinking well I have no support now; I don't know what I'd do with it. And sometimes I'm not getting up and sometimes I don't know what to do. Just continues to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well you don't really have no control over this at all when you feel helpless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: It feels like I should it feels like I don't have any control but I sure think I should. Sometimes I don't have to feel how bad it is and sometimes I do and I don't know how I go from one to the other but it sort of feels like that's a choice I'm making. But it seems like both when I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B11\">like I have a choice and when I feel like I don't have a choice those are both of those are illusory.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098810\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I guess that's again reminiscent of what things are like growing up with the appearance already controlled or something but I guess in another way really not being able to affect the things that matter the most at all. Or even have any confidence that you'd be heard about them, which you weren't. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">I had one last thought before getting into the advising portion of the program. So there is I was clear that I had some sense of how awful you have been feeling, how much and at some part intensely you'd rather be dead, and how precarious things have felt, I mean a lot especially over the last few <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">days we've been talking about it now. That said, there should need to be some kind of good things about this, obviously not about how you're feeling which is unmitigatingly awful pretty much. But it is pretty true to your experience and what's happened to you and it seems there's a lot we don't know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B52\">but we also kind of have, kind of have a clear sense of what's going on, why this weekend, why in some of the ways, why isn't that in some of the ways that you are, how what's going on now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: All of which is an improvement. I've been feeling really bad and have no idea of why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Well, yes, that's true. What I have in mind also is that it suggests you won't necessarily feel like you have this weekend for the rest of your life. In other words, it seems like you're very, very overwhelmed and feeling very, very awful but also in a process that's digesting something in <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B91\">a way, which isn't you shouldn't have to, it isn't fair I'm not trying to justify, I'm just really kind of in a diagnostic and a prognostic vein.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yes. No, I agree. I agree with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: And I guess I probably am saying that partly to be a little positive but at the same time I think it's true. I guess it makes me sort of think I'm not convinced you could never work at Starbucks again. You may decide that you don't want to and it's not worth it and it feels too much like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">you're going to die if you ever go back there and that's your call. But it seems to me plausible that in three or four days you might not feel as uniformly that way. I'm not trying to tell you you should definitely go back to work again. I don't know what the best thing is, but it does seem to me that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD2\">we don't know quite how this is going to shake out or whether working there will continue to feel like a fundamental of frontier being, or whether that will soften a little bit. It might and it might be, I don't know, but I think it's probably at least for me it's hard to know that today. Does that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD3\">seem reasonable? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Don't know what the thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yes, I know. That's a different question. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yes. I think I might -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:36:07] you should go back there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: I should've been out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: I mean practically can you tell them you're sick?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: I mean I did tell them that I was sick -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I mean you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: they don't care. I mean they said if you're not contagious we need you to come in. And I said I'm not coming in, so I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Well okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2098810\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">CLIENT: I'm just going to go home and see. I don't know. At this point they have the option to fire me because I didn't show up for work. I don't think they will -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">THERAPIST: I see, even if you're sick they can -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yes, if you're not contagious. I don't understand why or how that works but I think they will fire me because I didn't go in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:37:02] a good worker. Would any sort of doctors note...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">CLIENT: That would be really helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Be helpful?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I mean, I might be willing but you probably don't want it from me. I mean, in other words if it comes from somebody with a Ph.D. it's going to be clear what kind of problem it is. Whereas -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yes. Someone with an MD might be better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: I can ask Dr. Vaughn then. Since I know her, I'll call her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Yes, they got to like it. I'm not at all hesitant to write it, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">CLIENT: I understand. Yes, no I'll do that. That should smooth things over for them. I mean if there's documentation on this, I checked off that I had a disability. I got hired there after I was in the hospital three weeks ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Yes, and it's a no-brainer that you I don't quite know how to say that you weren't medically fit to go into work and not today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:38:03]. It's a no-brainer to you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yes, no I see your point. I will also, it may take me a little while but I will look for a time for us on Monday. I think that might be a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yes, that would be helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: You got three days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: I still overhear that three days is too long, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: No, it's the way it would be. I mean I understand the way these kind of things work. So we should stop for now for sure, but keep me posted. Would it make sense to plan a check-in by phone later today or do you want to just keep me posted and if it does we'll talk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Can I just do that?
