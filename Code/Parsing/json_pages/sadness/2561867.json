(chuckles) Um... (pause) (sighs) Yeah, um... (chuckles) Sorry, uh...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: (pause) You don\u2019t seem real convinced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: (chuckles) I\u2019m waiting for more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Um... Yeah. You know, um... (pause) I\u2019ve been thinking about... Well, yesterday I heard this... partial... interview with Brian Cranston, Breaking Bad (inaudible). I didn\u2019t know who it was, at first, but it just came on and... (inaudible)... whatever in his life. I, you know, again, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">I didn\u2019t know who it was, but he was saying, \u201cYeah, my dad left when I was 12, and I didn\u2019t find him until he was 22, (corrects) or until I was 22 and... (clears throat) Yeah, I... (clears throat) assuming when you drop into an interview, you kind of try to figure out who it is, what this context is, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">all this stuff. So I didn\u2019t catch, I don\u2019t remember all of what he was saying, but... Yeah, he was saying that his dad is now 90, and he\u2019s actually caring for him now, but when he found him, the first part of it was... not just for me to forgive him, but for him to forgive himself. And... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(clears throat) It just made me think about... You know, I mean, for me to forgive myself, I need to forgive my dad. That\u2019s, I think, at the crux of this, but then... because he was saying also that his (clears throat) dad... felt bad about it, but he couldn\u2019t, he never really have a chance to talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">about it, to express himself, and forgive himself in the process. I don\u2019t know that my dad has ever really had much opportunity, not that he would have taken it, but much opportunity to talk about the whole thing and... how (sighs) damaging it was and... (pause) you know... And so I guess, I\u2019m just... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s part of what (clears throat) he needs, is just the ability to just... talk about it in a setting that\u2019s not... scary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s a pretty big secret to feel like you have to keep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And, you know, I\u2019ve (chuckles) I\u2019ve dealt with keeping that secret myself, and I wasn\u2019t really even the one who was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: It wasn\u2019t your wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so... You know, and I think I\u2019ve mentioned the... (pause) the... (pause) the empathy that I have toward him about (clears throat)... how I would also... likely... want to... get through my therapy as quickly as possible, get this thing reduced to a misdemeanor as quickly as possible, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">all of those things that he did. And I understand that attitude. So part of that is (sighs), you know, I understand what you did, but, you know and this is not, you know, putting you on trial, but this is just kind of letting you know that your haste was damaging and... although I understand why you\u2019d <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">want to do that, I would have done the same thing, probably. But it can\u2019t go without... we can\u2019t continue without you knowing that... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: His actions affected more than just him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Exactly. And that if he needs to, this is an opportunity to talk about it, and to get it out and to... say what he needs to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561867\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Do you feel that you need him to do those things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: No, but I think I need him to hear me, although... (pause) I suspect he won\u2019t... (pause) Well, awhile back... and if you don\u2019t remember this, I apologize, that\u2019s okay. But I think I said something about, in, as part of a therapy... I discovered that I think he is depressed, you know, he suffers <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">from depression. And I don\u2019t think he agreed. He didn\u2019t agree. He said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not...,\u201d you know. But I don\u2019t... Like, I had to be diagnosed with depression before, and in some ways persuaded... that this feeling of angst and depression is not normal, need not be considered normal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">(pause) And... I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to react. I don\u2019t even know that it matters much, but (sighs)... I would at least like him to consider, as I consider his circumstances, for him to consider my circumstances: what I went through, in terms of understanding that I suffer from depression, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">and proceeded along those lines, so that he can say, \u201cWell, maybe I do. Maybe...,\u201d you know. So I empathize with him, he empathizes with me and understands that this is... it just didn\u2019t come out of nowhere and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Maybe a lot more acknowledgement of one of another than there has been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And, you know, Jesus Christ isn\u2019t just going to take away all of this pain, because I think that\u2019s what his... (sighs) That\u2019s been his strength, and not one that I\u2019ve been able to rely on myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, it might work for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sure it does, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not necessarily something that provides you the same measure of comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Just because you have raised me doesn\u2019t mean that I have the same... (pause) the same relationship that he has. I have one, but it\u2019s not the same that he has and... anyway. That\u2019s... (chuckles) He turns 80 this week, this weekend. I think I mentioned that, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: The birthday, the deadline. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: So... (pause) that\u2019s kind of where I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a fuller answer than \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d (client affirms) Having you present in the current moment is also... useful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I can\u2019t just spring it on you like... I have to collect my thoughts. (pause) But I also... (pause) I also saw my psychiatrist yesterday. (pause) And... (sighs) you know...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: That reminds me. It\u2019s probably my turn in the phone tag. (chuckles) (client affirms) We\u2019ve been continuing to... (client affirms) (inaudible) (pause) and soon continuing to leave each other messages (inaudible\/blocked).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s what she said, so, you know, she didn\u2019t... You know, she said, \u201cUnless there is something you specifically wanted to talk about, we will talk, I will talk to her, but, you know...\u201d So, because I asked her, you know, but... No, no, no, that\u2019s fine. Um, anyway. And, you know... (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">I\u2019m just trying to recall what we talked about on Monday... (pause) versus another time, we talked about this specifically, was my wife\u2019s concern that I\u2019m not interested in her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">Now there are several, as I see it, there are several factors at play here that are combining into kind of a mess, that I\u2019m not sure what... how to approach. Some of those... my lack of interest for the past two to three years. (pause) Now, she\u2019s concerned that, since, because she\u2019s put on weight for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">the past three years or so, that I\u2019m not interested in her physically, I\u2019m not attracted to her. Now (sighs) I don\u2019t put much... I don\u2019t give that much credence, but the... but that\u2019s how she feels. Although I am trying to persuade her that\u2019s not the case... the, any, any impulses to actually have sex... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">feel a little bit... under pressure (pause) to make her feel like she\u2019s not... the reason for my lack of interest. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561867\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">(pause) There is the... so there is that. There is the anxiety over, \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t ask me to... or hint about having sex tonight, because I\u2019m just not there.\u201d There is the fact that... my anxiety levels are still elevated. (pause) And... she thinks that... it\u2019s due to medication. Then, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">she\u2019s on me about talking to my psychiatrist about this. Well, I did talk to my psychiatrist about this, and she\u2019s not necessarily convinced that it is... the medication. And she\u2019s resistant to taking me off or lower the Zoloft, because she thinks it\u2019s helping me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Do you agree?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure. I think it might... but sh -, I was on 200 mg of that, 450 mg of Levotrin (ph), which was like, well over what the... manufacturer recommends. So now I\u2019m down to 75 with that, and I will be off of that in, about Sunday. So, and that, apparently, is the drug that doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">come with sexual side effects (therapist affirms), probably why I was put on it back in, with Doctor Torres (ph), before I left. Um (sighs)... (pause) There is the... as we\u2019ve talked about, there is the, the expectation that the sex will be exactly the same as it always has been. I have not had much <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">of a conversation with her about that. I had a little bit, just in terms of (sighs) initiating it can be a little bit more... natural, as opposed to just her, just saying, you know... hinting or you know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(pause) There is the... the knowledge that I have that... when I think about going to a massage place... if I just masturbate... I won\u2019t feel that way after that. So there is an interest in the excitement, the thrill... rubbing up against the... knowledge that... the sex that I have with my wife isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">that interesting, you know. And (sighs) what else is there? (chuckles) Seems like that should be enough. Um... And so, you know, for the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve masturbated twice a week or so, and had sex with my wife once a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, I mean the reason the, I guess the evidence that points to it not really being a medication issue is that, I mean, generally, when people have a sexual side effect from the SSRI, it\u2019s, you know, a decrease in interest and a decrease in ability to achieve an erection or have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">an orgasm, delayed orgasm. You\u2019re not really having that, because there is still interest, just not necessarily interest in sex with your wife. Your ability to achieve an erection and have orgasm is all there, and all the parts are working. (client affirms) Medication doesn\u2019t pick and choose who you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">going to have side effects with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, yeah. Well, that\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It seems more relationally based to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that\u2019s what I... have willfully come to accept. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561867\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: It seems like, I mean, as you talk about it, it seems like there is some resentment that you feel with your wife in that kind of the pattern that\u2019s been established. Does that feel... on target or am I... misperceiving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Um... a little bit. I mean, we talked about this on Sat , on Sunday... and you know, I said, \u201cLook, you want to have sex at 10:00, 11:00 at night when I\u2019m dead tired. I prefer to have sex in the morning. You don\u2019t like to have sex in the morning because you stay up too late, so our clocks <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">are not coordinated for this. So try, you know, looking at it from my perspective.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">Secondly, back... I can\u2019t really claim this anymore, but... you know, back when... she was going through severe depression, she had no interest and... (pause) And I dealt with it, you know? But it seemed like the sex was not... desired. She would do it, but it seemed more like charity. Now... that said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">that was medication. Now, I can\u2019t use it, but... I feel like... pressure to have sex in and of itself creates its own anxiety that (sighs)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Well, you feel like you\u2019re disappointing her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Disappointing her or that... (pause) you know... the... that her interest in sex is just for her self-esteem. It\u2019s not that she wants to have sex; it\u2019s just that she wants to feel wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Oh, she wants to feel wanted. She doesn\u2019t necessarily want you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Well, I mean, she might want me, but, you know, she doesn\u2019t necessarily... I don\u2019t know. It just seems like it feeds an insecurity than it does an actual desire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What is it that leads you to feel that way? That she\u2019s stated that she fears that you\u2019re not interested, because she\u2019s gained weight or is...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah, frequently, yeah. She calls herself fat and, you know, I say, \u201cSo... do you want to go to the gym?\u201d (pause) \u201cYeah, but not till later.\u201d \u201cOkay, well I might just go.\u201d \u201cNo, no, I need to go. I\u2019m fat.\u201d I just... it\u2019s gotten to the point, where it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t even know what to say. \u201cNo, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">you\u2019re not fat.\u201d You know, that\u2019s... what any wise man says. And, you know, I know she\u2019s put on weight, but it\u2019s not like I really care. (pause) But it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, I mean, I think, something you mentioned a while back is right on, that I\u2019m seeking excitement, the thrill and that\u2019s not there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s something, you certainly don\u2019t want to be put in the position of playing this role: where you\u2019re supposed to make her feel better about herself, either verbally, by saying, \u201cNo, no, no, you\u2019re not fat, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve gained weight,\u201d or having sex to make her feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200711\">sexy. I think you can disengage from the battle, you know, with the verbal piece, when she says, \u201cOh, I should go to the gym, I\u2019m fat,\u201d you don\u2019t have to say \u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d You can say what you\u2019re actually feeling, which is, \u201cI really don\u2019t like hearing you talk about yourself <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200712\">that way.\u201d And it sounds like that would be honest and it also removes... You\u2019ve tried that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve tried that before. (chuckles) But... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: I would k , even, that might not end the conversation, but it ends you being forced into the role of playing the other side of her head, or that \u201cThis is what I hope to hear.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561867\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: \u201cDo I look fat in this skirt?\u201d (pause) \u201cI don\u2019t like hearing you talk (chuckles) too much or something (chuckles).\u201d I don\u2019t know!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: It ends the conversation. (client affirms) I know it doesn\u2019t answer the question she\u2019s asking, but what it does is it sends a consistent message, this is not a conversation you\u2019re having. It\u2019s not really a helpful conversation on either end. It\u2019s not good for her, it\u2019s not good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, yeah, and I understand that. You know, I just (sighs)... So I think, in some ways, sex becomes this bargaining chip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it\u2019s another way of... sort of acting out that... conversation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And... (pause) Something else that came to mind, but I can\u2019t remember what it was... (pause) So I mean, I guess if there is resentment, it\u2019s because... because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s genuine. (inaudible) (therapist affirms) And that\u2019s why I say, can this just be a more natural...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Right. It sounds like you want sex between the two of you to be about both of you actually wanting to have sex with one another. It feels to you like sex has become something that makes her feel better about herself, rather than being about... actually engaging in intercourse with you. (client <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200811\">affirms) Is that...? I mean, you said you talked a little bit on Sunday; is that something you were able to express? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: That, no. But what we talked about was... like, this is, this is... you know, if we\u2019re going to do this, it has to be a concerted effort to actually make this about wanting each other and not just about, you know, two conflicting schedules and so... But we didn\u2019t... we didn\u2019t touch on the... <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200831\">(chuckles) my fear that this was just a way for her to boost her ego. That I wasn\u2019t sure how to even approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: Well, I think framing what you want it to be about. Like, you want it to be about you guys both enjoying each other, rather than what you don\u2019t want to have happen. I mean, focusing on making it something better for the two of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But I can\u2019t help feeling after it\u2019s over like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m off the hook for a few days.\u201d You know? (pause) So with that is the... it conflicts with my desire for excitement and the thrill. And, you know, I fully understand the... the need to feel good about myself and what gives me <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">a low-level bump, or a spike... and a more elevated, you know... sustainable... increase. And... (pause) I think, yeah. We\u2019ve talked about this, and I guess (sighs), it\u2019s almost like, you know, a quick fix versus... eating healthy, you know what I mean? A shot to the arm, versus you know, maintained <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200872\">exercise regimen. As boring as the latter sounds... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: (pause) What is the equivalent of the going to the gym and eating healthy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: (pause) (chuckles) (pause) That\u2019s a very good question that you\u2019ve asked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I got a little lost in the metaphors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well... perhaps I\u2019m hiding behind them, because, you know, for me, the quick fix is masturbating by myself, or you know, going to get a massage, or whatever. And... actually do things that are... sustainably good for me, like going (inaudible), doing exercises, actually eating healthy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">That\u2019s actually a (chuckles) not metaphor, but a reality. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561867\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Right. Those things actually make you feel... good, long term. But they\u2019re not exciting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: No, no, they\u2019re not. Not at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: But having a fulfilling sexual relationship with your wife could be and also that could be healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s, I guess, a mystery to me. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s actually ever been mutually... satisfying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Ever?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Or.. well, I don\u2019t know. I mean... (pause) It may have been, but I don\u2019t really, I would never really say that it\u2019s been... (pause) caring. (pause) And I think that is (sighs), I think there are various reasons for that. I think one is that... (pause) I think through the years... of our marriage... <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">long time, well, actually, not the marriage. Through the years of our relationship, we\u2019re talking 18 years ago... but, if my memory... serves me, it was more about me just wanting to get off. But that might be more harsh than in reality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">In any event, you know, we did go through long periods where she was suffering from depression and the medication was not helping, or was, not helping her or wasn\u2019t helping, it was helping her, but wasn\u2019t helping the sex. (pause) And now, it seems like it\u2019s the opposite. It just seems like... not the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">opposite. The roles have changed in, in... With her, it seems like she just wants to get off and... (pause) So I\u2019m not sure exactly what... what to do about... (pause) making it more exciting, or if the reason it\u2019s not exciting is because of my frame of mind, my... my esteem. Sometimes... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">THERAPIST: What makes... like, what makes like, the massage parlor exciting or something else seem exciting? What is it about it that\u2019s enticing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: \u201cParlor\u201d makes it sound so seedy!

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Okay, fine! (pause) What... I don\u2019t know, because... I think because I\u2019m relieved of my... better judgment. I\u2019m put in a position where, I put myself in a position where... things could happen... and whether or not they do happen is not... I mean, I guess it\u2019s kind of like going on a first date, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A51\">you know. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. There is a hope that something might happen, but (clears throat)... you know, it\u2019s... (aside: Sorry. \/sound of spraying\/ I\u2019m kind of obsessed with having clean glasses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You want to be able to see! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yes, I want to see.) And, you know (sighs)... The other day, it was Tuesday maybe, I went and I was in my room... and looking at places that I might go to, but I did not want to lie to her. I did not want to lie to her, I did not want to come home... and (clears throat)... you know, jump in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A91\">the shower because I had, you know, the smell of this oil on me, or whatever, you know. That\u2019s even just going to the place, the reputable place down the street, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Why would you have to lie to her about that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">CLIENT: Because (sighs)... I don\u2019t know. Not the reputable place, but the other places, because I don\u2019t want to say, \u201cOh, yeah, I went over to Cheshire and got a massage.\u201d \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d you know. I fully know why I went and... and I don\u2019t want to have to say, if she asks <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">me, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d I did not want to have to say, \u201cOh, I just went to... the library,\u201d or something. So I didn\u2019t, and I... you know... did a search on YouTube, not YouTube, on the Internet and looked at some porn and you know, masturbated.

And it\u2019s, (chuckles) you know, at least, if I\u2019m going to feel bad about myself, at least I\u2019m not spending $50 an hour to do it, you know? (chuckles) In here I\u2019m spending $145 an hour to feel better about myself. (chuckles). No, um... and not that I felt good about it, but it <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200B11\">seemed the lesser of an evil, you know, and... (pause) but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">THERAPIST: If you, if you were... if she felt fulfilled with your sex life, would you still feel badly about looking at porn and masturbating? Like, is that in itself something you feel guilty about or is it...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, that is, that is, no, I think, yeah, because, you know, \u201cWhat, you want to masturbate instead of having sex with me?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Right. Or if you were doing both, it might not feel that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a legitimate question. If it were both, it would be one thing, but yeah, I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">THERAPIST: But it feels like you want to do this, but you don\u2019t want me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">THERAPIST: And she\u2019ll turn it into something is wrong with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">CLIENT: And that is understandable. I would completely understand that. It\u2019s a good argument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Do you agree? Do you think there is part of that at play?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">CLIENT: (pause) Um... yeah, I do. I think because I am excited by the images, I\u2019m not excited you know, about basically just satisfying her and that\u2019s pretty much it (after which I had to masturbate anyway, which, you know, she knows about and, you know, is present for). So... I don\u2019t know. No matter <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">what I do, it\u2019s not a very good feeling.

That seems wrong, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Well, some of the comments that you\u2019ve made, like the feeling of, \u201cWell, I\u2019m off the hook for three days.\u201d That feels like there is some... to me, it sounds like there is built up, right? Just not feeling resentfulness of her, but of the expectation that this, that this be a part of your <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">relationship, and you don\u2019t really feel like you want it to be right now. (client affirms) Or for a while, I mean, right? This is not a passing three-month difficulty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, that\u2019s absolutely true. I guess, you know (sighs)... (pause) Yeah, I guess (inaudible) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">THERAPIST: The other piece that brings the feeling of resentment up for me is the, that it feels like sex is a tool that she uses. You\u2019re the person that she happens to have it with, to make her feel better about her, and it doesn\u2019t feel, it doesn\u2019t sound like you feel especially wanted. (client affirms) <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF1\">Used, and that\u2019s, I guess that\u2019s where I kind of pick up on this feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">CLIENT: How dare she!

I mean... I don\u2019t know... (pause) yeah. I guess I do wonder what it would be like if she were fit, and feeling great about herself, and all of those things; what that would be like, you know? Because it\u2019s been a long time since she\u2019s, if ever, been fit <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D51\">and mentally healthy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">THERAPIST: At the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... (pause) (sighs) (pause) I hear you, and I think if you\u2019re right... you know... on that aspect. Why it is... I don\u2019t know. I guess maybe it\u2019s this fear that leads me to think that I... am not attracted to her or... the expectation that the sex won\u2019t be fulfilling. (pause) Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D91\">when I\u2019m by myself and servicing myself... I don\u2019t have those concerns, obviously. (pause) And for me, it\u2019s a way to... get past this feeling, there is just this hole to go in and do something that is a spike of feeling good about myself. (pause) But, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same. (pause) That said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200D92\">I mean, I mean, I don\u2019t want to... but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helping, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">THERAPIST: This is too hard of a question to answer in two minutes, so it\u2019s something to think about over the course of the week.

I think... quite poignant, because... not that (chuckles) like my father and mother, who seemed to have sex and had a child every time, but... I don\u2019t know what the purpose is and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not procreation! (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">CLIENT: It\u2019s certainly not, and... (pause) that said, it\u2019s a mystery to me, it actually is. I, you know, I\u2019m going to think about it over this next week and I might even talk to Julie about it, because... I honestly don\u2019t think I have... maybe less than ten times in my life have I had sex where I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E11\">just like... \u201cThat was really, really awesome; that was really special.\u201d That\u2019s pretty sad, I\u2019ll admit. But not knowing what the expectations are, it\u2019s hard for them to ever be fulfilled. What it could be, don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so I think that\u2019s definitely something to think about. Kind of what you expect it to be, what role, you know... what role you think it can have, should have, want it to have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">CLIENT: And what it could possibly do if I\u2019m feeling miserable about myself, you know? Is it something that (sighs)... I can... I mean, in some ways, I feel like (inaudible), in some ways I feel like... I have no business having sex, because I... am only going through the motions. It doesn\u2019t mean anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: But maybe that could be okay sometimes. Maybe you could create a definition where that\u2019s okay.
