(inaudible at 0:00:04). (Pause) Okay. (Pause) Geoffrey (ph), hi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Crazy couple of weeks there. My last day at Texas A&amp;M (ph). I just had my last shift, yeah. So I signed off there, which was sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was sad to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: How long have you been working there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Just about a year now. It was August 1st when I started it last, so just about a calendar year. It was good leaving. I mean, everyone was really fantastic about it. My guy that I work with, Mitchell, he was really good about it. But yeah, it was sad, it was really sad to leave. [0:00:55] I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">didn't want to. I really like working with him. I like the friendship that we had and everything. And... yeah, I was a little sad leaving. (Pause) It was a little surreal, thinking about it. Yeah, and I'll be leaving my other job in two days. Then I'll be off on Monday. And then I'll be back, I'll get <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">right into school. It just seems kind of wild at this point, just the... all the stuff I've been planning for for so long, thinking about it actually happening now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's nuts. It's cool, it's really happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. It'll be good. It'll be good. Most of it I'm excited for. I mean, I think one of the only things about this year that I'll be sad about leaving will be the job at the Texas A&amp;M. [0:02:00] It's the only thing that I'll miss on any level. (Pause) Yeah, it was really sad leaving. I almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">felt... I was choking up almost, like I was going to start crying or something almost. It was bizarre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What strikes you as bizarre about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I don't know. I wasn't expecting to be that... I wasn't expecting to be that (pause) moved by leaving, you know what I mean? It caught me by surprise. It caught me by surprise. (Pause) I mean, I guess I feel like that was a... (Pause) I don't know if I talked about it a lot here, but it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">a really... (Pause) It was a really unique environment for me, in that it was just really pleasant. [0:02:59] It was very...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't know much about the gig or Mitchell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: No, the work that I did there, it was a lot of kind of paper pushing stuff, a lot of invoices, it was just clerical work. But the guy that I worked with was a really nice guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Mitchell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Really nice guy, yeah. He took really good care of me. They were very good employers, very understanding. And I came to really care about the work, and I felt like I was contributing to this organization's union that I cared about, that I respected. And I felt like I was doing well. I felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">I was a positive contribution. I didn't have this sort of nagging (pause) self-hatred that accompanied school for so long, where it just... everything just made me feel like I was horrible or something, like I was... just the task being constantly just to try to get over that, you know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">[0:04:04] It was a very different environment in that sense. I had a really great relationship with Mitchell. I was just very good friends with him, you know what I mean? (Pause) But yeah, it was just unique in that sense. It just felt good. It was just a good place. Even it (sp?) had all this kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200293\">of... this stuff mixed up with it, you know what I mean? It was really hard to work (inaudible at 0:04:33) at times and stuff. School, I loved it, but, I mean, obviously it drove me crazy in a lot of ways, and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559949\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and all the Kaley (sp?) stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, this Kaley was really emotionally turbulent at times and stuff. But this was just a year of just a really great experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, kind of almost on... well, very clearly positive. [0:05:03] No... (chuckling) it didn't have a lot of negatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) I mean, I guess the only negatives would have been my freaking out for so long about having to tell them I was leaving, which proved totally unwarranted, you know what I mean? So there was that, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Unequivocally positive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, in a way that (pause) I really had never experienced with something I was involved in, you know what I mean? And (pause) yeah, it just made me wonder why I was leaving it when I was leaving today. I was just like, I'm going to be leaving. I'm going to go on to school. It's going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">to be a shit storm again probably, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: And just leaving, I just... I don't know, I was just kind of like, oh God. [0:05:58] Maybe this isn't the right thing to do or something. Literally second guessing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you know what it makes me think of is, it's good to have that in your back pocket to know what a good work environment feels like. You don't forget it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: I suppose. That's not what I was taking away from it so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Because it can make a big difference what kind of place you work at and how the work feels. It depends a lot, I think, so much on the environment in which you work. It's so huge, who you're working for, with, how the office feels. It's so critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I've always believed that. Work, yeah, that's your contribution to the world. That could really make or break...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: And I'll say this, that I think having a good experience, you can kind of go, this is what it's... that it's not unreasonable to try to find a place that feels like that again, as opposed to, if you're used to getting a lot of cruddy treatment, you can make yourself kind of go through all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">these... [0:07:14]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know what you can expect. You know what you can demand of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, that's true. I guess maybe what I thought from it was... I mean, in a way, that was such an enjoyable experience for me, that it was kind of beyond what I suppose I even suspected was possible. There's nothing bad about it. It was just... the only thing bad about it was that I couldn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">get more of it. I couldn't do it full time. I mean, that was the only thing bad about it. But... (Pause) [0:08:00] What I... I don't know, I guess what... (Pause) It makes... yeah, I guess the way that... I totally see what you're saying. But all I can think about is, God, must be something really masochistic <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">or something about me going back to school...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Oh, really? Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Because it's... in a way that experience was what I... the idea that life could be like that is a liberatory (sp?) fantasy, that I could live the rest of my life in a job like that and feel good and not feel like crap all the time, and not feel this dynamic that I felt for so long in school, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">which was so kind of suffocating and...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559949\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Interesting. (Crosstalk) [0:08:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah, so part of me was like, why am I leaving that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Why would I leave? That's interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: So in a sense it's like (pause) yeah, sure. Knowing that there's type of experience is great, because it lets you sort of demand more of things. On the other hand what I'm thinking of is, knowing that now is going to make me feel even weirder about (pause) more difficult experiences that I willfully <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">bring myself into. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: Why would I leave that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. That was my area. I don't know. It was untouched by the rest of my life, you know what I mean? It was something I sought out, and I found, and I made it. It was me, and it was nothing... you know what I mean? I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Well, that seems to be pretty significant, too. How do you mean? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I don't know. School is deeply wound up with my parents' expectations and stuff. [0:10:01] And just that report card dynamic. You've got to bring your report card home to show your parents, you know what I mean? It's... I don't know. There wasn't... there was a sense of ownership over the gig <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">at Texas A&amp;M that I did, that I don't feel with school or anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Like literally and figuratively you're not being graded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Or just more so like this... (Pause) It was my own. It was an autonomous space. I mean, yeah, I'm not being graded in a way. I don't answer to anyone else besides my own... they're never going to go and talk to my parents or something. My parents have never met them. No one there's going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">meet my parents. It was a little corner of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Your own thing. [0:10:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, it was just totally my own, you know what I mean? And it was nice. And (pause) yeah, I guess as I was leaving it I just sort of was thinking to myself, God, why leave that? Maybe that... maybe it wasn't inevitable that I would have to (pause) stop doing something like that. I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">It just made me wonder, why go back to school? (Pause) The whole time I was at Texas A&amp;M I was just thinking about what am I going to do afterwards, you know what I mean (pause), and just imposing these...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Do you kind of expect school to feel... go back to feeling that, what are my grades and that kind of thing? Is that...? How do you feel about...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, on some level I... I think I'm going to have a different relationship with school when I go back (pause), I think. [0:11:58] I think I learned a lot about myself and the way that I dealt with schools through examining my experience here and reflecting on it. So think there are certain <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">things I'll be able to definitely change and (pause) separate a little bit. I don't know that I would want... well, I don't know. I'd imagine I'd like to stay a little bit more distant from some of my professors (chuckling). It felt like being as close with Kaley as I was made it fantastically difficult <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">to study under her, because I became wrapped up in so much more stuff. But that's a different conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">The point being, I feel like I'm going to be able to approach school in a very different way. But I feel like there's something inherent about that dynamic, the (pause) sort of classroom environment that sort of infantilizing or... there's a power dynamic there, you know what I mean, where you're kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">of doing what you're told, and you're chasing after a mark or something, that I suspect is going to revisit certain types of feelings and stuff. [0:13:19] I mean, it's school. It's going to be stressful, you know what I mean? I'm probably going to freak out a lot. I'm probably going to (pause) get overwhelmed <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">a lot (pause), have bad days and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559949\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, there's going to be that kind of pressure on it where it wasn't at this gig.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: I suppose. (Pause) Yeah, I don't even know. I don't even know where I'm going with all of it. I guess I just... (Pause) I didn't want to leave when I was leaving today. I wanted to stay. [0:14:02] I feel like I found a place where I felt good, you know what I mean, where I had sort of... from <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">day one already had access to the type of encouragement and acceptance that I felt like I could never get in school, you know what I mean? And it just struck me as odd when I was leaving that I just so quickly (pause) hopped out of it to go right back into school. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but that's how you're kind of coming at the... at going back to school, too, huh? I mean, what are your...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Sort of. I mean, this doesn't have anything [to do] (ph) about school so much. I mean, that really just came up as I was leaving Texas A&amp;M. I guess those are impressions I have more of my leaving Texas A&amp;M and going back to school. [0:14:57] I mean, I'm kind of excited to go back to school in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">certain ways. I mean, I'm familiar with it. I'm comfortable with it. You know what I mean? I know that environment, that schedule, that lifestyle. I can do that, you know what I mean? I feel like I can just slip right back into it after a year off without missing a beat. But... (Pause) So when I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">about going back to school I don't think about this stuff so much. What I think about over the last hour, leaving the Texas A&amp;M, I think about this stuff, you know what I mean? (Pause) Yeah, I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: What, what? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: There are people that really liked me, you know what I mean? I felt really comfortable, I felt really accepted there. I felt valuable. I felt empowered, I felt like I was a valuable contribution. [0:16:02] People would ask me questions. Mitchell seeked out my advice on things and stuff. (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">I don't know. It was different, you know what I mean? (Pause) And I felt bad that I was leaving Mitchell. I felt like I was abandoning him. (Pause) That's what I felt. I felt like I was... I had a choice to stay and did not stay. And I felt like I chose not Mitchell. (Pause) I felt like I was giving <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200772\">something even indirectly not good to him. [0:17:02] [I was abandoning] 9ph) his kindness or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) (Pause) Yeah, like what? Like it's a place that treated you very well, and you're kind of leaving them behind, dumping on them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly how I feel. They would have kept me, I could have stayed there with them. They would have continued to be great. But I just cut it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: No, I hear you. Yeah.

And then I had this place where I felt great. I felt fantastic. I felt better than I ever felt, you know what I mean? And then I left it. It makes me feel self-conscious, you know what I mean?

I guess in the back <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">of my mind it's going to be like, well, you had a really great thing, you know what I mean? You didn't have to go back to school. [0:19:57] You had a great job. (Pause) What are you complaining about? You set this up for yourself. You went after this. Really no one even encouraged you to apply to school. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B2\">You just kind of did it on your own. (Pause) I don't know.

I mean, you're getting into something about this that... I mean, I hear the part where you feel like, what am I doing leaving... looking a gift horse in the mouth? (Pause) [0:20:59] And some... this level of (pause), yeah, abandoning and phony and fake is really... it <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200911\">seems pretty important that it's coming out of this, too. (Pause) I mean, because yeah, obviously on one level of it, you look at it from bird's eye view, it's like, well, of course, you need to keep moving on professionally and career-wise. And of course it makes sense. But then there's something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, I can see that, too, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you're getting at the subjective kind of experience of it, which is obviously what we're here to talk about (laughing). And just one thing that strikes me about it is that (pause) this doesn't... I don't know how this relates to that kind of abandoning feeling you have, but I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">just thinking about how you do feel like, God damn, it's been a place where you haven't had all the angst and all the anxieties and all the kind of worries that can accompany work or whatever, or being... it was a place where they really... and how much that means to you to have a place like that, where <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200952\">none of that stuff enters into the equation (pause), and what it would mean then to give it up, to lose that, to have that lost. But I hear it in some way, too, like you feel like you're letting them down. [0:22:56] It kind of comes... there's this other element of you feeling like... I mean, it's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200953\">just about you losing, which has some importance to you and significance in just that way I just mentioned. But there's also this level of you sort of saying, yeah, I feel guilty about it, or I feel phony or this other line of (pause) meaning it has to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559949\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) I don't know. I put... I justify a lot of things that I do based upon this self-perception I have of myself as an anxious person, as a person who has things to work out or something. It's why I come here. It's why I smoke. It's why I feel... in the last analysis in my head that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">what it falls on, you know what I mean? [0:24:00] That's why. That's why (pause) I feel unhappy about things. And that's why I feel like there's unresolved things with my family and stuff, and it's going to stay that way or something. Just that idea that there's things that I'm... that make me unhappy <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200972\">or something. I lean against it a lot to sort of just (pause) make sense of things, why I smoke, why I (inaudible at 0:24:36) with my dad, why I feel like I'm going to have a strange relationship with my family in Maine for my whole life or something, you know what I mean, because I feel like it's impossible <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200973\">for me to feel good and comfortable (pause) and sort these things out. [0:25:00] I don't know. (Pause) Just to be really honest in my head, what I was thinking today was (pause), maybe it's possible for you to feel better about some of that stuff than you convince yourself at times. Maybe you're not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Huh!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: That miserable.

[0:26:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Precisely. Yeah, kind of.

I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Yes. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Because leaving it I felt really sad because I think, in a lot of ways, I'll miss that place and stuff.

And I'll miss that. I worked a lot this year. Typically I was working six, seven days a week. I looked forward to going to the office. I loved it.

I like this climb. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C11\">Now I'm going to go up a little bit higher or do something that's a little bit more beyond my... why ever leave what's tried and true and good?

Why would I even try to expand, do something beyond that, when I know it's going to be filled with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C12\">anxiety and (chuckling)... I don't know.

And it's just sort of slipping right back into that, September.

I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">know. I just didn't want to do it. And it was making me really sad, and it was frustrating me and stuff. You know what I mean?

(Pause) [0:34:00] Yeah, I don't know. Just second guessing myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">THERAPIST: No, I hear it.

It's the act of leaving that's... that feels difficult for me, you know what I mean? That I effected it. It was my decision. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Ah! Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">CLIENT: Graduating (ph) school was a decision made for me, you know what I mean? There's a lot of that stuff.

I felt like, just by thinking about it, I was planning my escape in October, a month, is when I started applying to school. [0:35:04] A month after I started I was already planning my steps up. You know what I mean? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, I can see it from that angle. In a way it feels like there's a lot of agency here in what you're doing. Like, I've decided to leave this thing. And it had good things, and I'm leaving it. And it's me that's choosing to do so. It's not because I'm graduating, and they're kicking <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200E51\">me out (chuckling). It's like, I'm choosing to stop. And that has consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah, or... yeah, it makes me think about... (Pause) Yeah. But it's more culpability on myself for the impacts of it. [0:35:59] Yeah. (Pause) I don't know. I feel silly.

But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: What's simple about that? That's very... (laughing) I mean, there's something about how...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. It's not... it shouldn't be too scandalizing to someone at this point in their lives, you hope. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: I think actually it makes a lot... I mean, if you have a job like that where you feel really connected with the people that work there and you did that kind... you felt good about the work you were doing, and you found an environment that means a lot to you, it's... sadness, it seems like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">the natural response. [0:36:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) It's funny though, because particularly in comparison with my experience at P.F.

[0:41:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, is any of it coming from me, anything from me that you're noticing? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: I don't know. (Pause) I don't know, nothing comes to mind. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: The way that I'm communicating, you should be talking about something else or something (pause) deeper or something? (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: I don't know. Nothing comes to mind too much. [0:41:58] Nothing's really sticking out as I think about that. You know when you get sad sometimes, and you feel kind of... you just feel sort of... your thoughts are just kind of tight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: Tight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: Like rigid, you know what I mean? When you're about to start crying, your throat kind of tightens up, and you're kind of, okay, trying to keep things out, trying not to exacerbate it, you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: I just kind of feel stuck in there, you know what I mean? I feel like (pause), yeah, kept in abeyance or something. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, your feelings about Mitchell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. [0:42:57] Yeah. (Pause) I didn't really even want to come after I left. I kind of wanted to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20121\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and do what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20123\">CLIENT: Lay in bed. Not talk to people (chuckling). You know what I mean? I remember thinking to myself as I was walking... because when I was leaving Texas A&amp;M I felt really choked up for a minute. There was a couple moments where I genuinely thought I was going to shed a tear or something. And I remembered <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201231\">thinking to myself (pause), that would be weird to come here feeling like that. It reminded me of a conversation a while ago where we kind of said... when I was reflecting on Eric and his experience, after being with his therapist for a month or two, he said he had a session where he started crying <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201232\">everywhere and stuff. [0:43:58] And I thought to myself, oh man, I really never felt close to that here. In a way, this isn't a problem to me, it just strikes me as interesting. It's just... well, it's just not my experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20122-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20122-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559949\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20125\">THERAPIST: Eric?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20127\">CLIENT: But I remember when I was feeling that I was kind of like, I feel like I should go home or something. I feel I just want to be alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20129\">THERAPIST: Maybe that's part of the deeper experience you feel is missing sometimes, some sort of... I mean, I'm struck by the... yeah, the kind of sense that there is some feeling coming up, emergent feeling of leaving that you try to kind of... you felt like, I want to keep this a little bit at bay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201291\">I just want to go home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah, and if I feel... (chuckling) if you (ph) feel like our conversation right now is superficial, it's... I feel like the first place my mind is going to go is the fact that I know I don't even want to be talking about this. [0:45:08] So it likely has a lot to do with me making this a superficial <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B1\">conversation, you know what I mean? That's more so than, I think this is really interesting that you're just not... (inaudible at 0:45:24), you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012D\">THERAPIST: That's it, that's right. Yeah, I see. (Pause) In some way there's more here that you know has potential (chuckling)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012F\">CLIENT: That's the suspicion, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: I think... well, I think that's right. There's something about you leaving and the relationship with Mitchell that carries with it some emotional weight. I mean, one thing that maybe is a little bit obvious is the difference between the work relationship you had with Mitchell and the one <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201311\">you had with your dad. [0:46:00] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know, it didn't even cross my mind but is interesting. They were happening at the same time. (Pause) It's really funny, too. I thought about maybe mentioning this earlier, but I thought it would have sounded corny. But Mitchell told me last week that he... he's about 39, 38. He <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201331\">just found out, in his words, that he's going to be a dad. And I remember thinking about it all day, I don't know, the way that I don't usually... people talking about the royal family having a kid, you know what I mean? I don't know, I was really interested and thinking about it and stuff, and... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: What were you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20137\">CLIENT: That he was going to be a really good dad. [0:47:03] I almost wanted to tell him that, but I thought it would sound patronizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20139\">THERAPIST: Oh man, yeah. God, you're probably right (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013B\">CLIENT: I mean, about him being a good dad. [There's no doubt about that] (ph) (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, I mean, I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2013F\">CLIENT: But yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20141\">THERAPIST: It's about the best thing you can say to somebody expecting to be a father for the first time (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.
