I thought I knew, but I guess I just assumed how this is supposed to work. So, if you could (chuckling)... how is it supposed to work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: You've been asking that a lot. I'm not... what changed? What changed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: No, it's just, I guess from last time, right? Because it seems like... just to get it clear, I'm supposed to talk. Is that how it works?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Is that... did you... what did you feel like you were doing before?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: That (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just wondered if that is the correct assumption. [0:02:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like there's something I'm not providing for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: No, that's not... I'm not sure what you're supposed to provide, so I can't really say you're not providing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Does it feel like there's something missing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: No. I don't know what to look for. I don't know, I guess it seems there's a lack of structure (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So I don't... I just want to be sure that thing, like, what... yeah. I'm looking for structure and not finding it and realizing that I have to make it on my own, I guess? That is what I'm confused about (sniffing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well, it's certainly true that the type of therapy that I do, on some level, does... I mean, on some level, has a lot of structure (chuckling). [0:03:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: But on some level, sort of the... some basic things, there's less structure. There's not you talk, I talk, you talk, right? There's not that kind of structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: There's not, let's come in with a topic every time, although you could do that, and you have certainly. That's why I'm kind of curious about what changed because you would often start by saying, you know, I wrote down what we talked about last week, and I was thinking about this. So you actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">used to do a lot more of that, and something seems to have changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: No, I still do that (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: But you don't... maybe, but you come in... like, you used to write stuff down, and then bring it up right at the beginning, like, I was thinking about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: And you've been doing less of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Hmm. Yeah, I'm not sure what changed because I always right down stuff right after, even last time (chuckling), even though I didn't say much. But I still wrote down stuff that we talked... (Sniffing) [0:03:59] Because you said that I should... if there's something that comes up between us that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">you should talk about that. So I guess I thought maybe I should voice this thing that I feel scared of sometimes, that there is no structure. Or sometimes (blowing nose) there's just this open space, you know, 45 minutes, and I have to fill it up with something interesting and insightful or whatever, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: For you or for me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: For both of us (chuckling). It's because sometimes I feel like, I don't know if I can do that (chuckling). I feel lost and stuff, I guess. [0:04:53] Like, this is not a classroom where we have assignments and, like, a structure of a discussion, so... I guess I prefer that (chuckling). But life <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">is whatever it will be, like the classroom (ph), so...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559384\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, you prefer that, hence going back for a degree you've already had before...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: So that there's structure in place for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm happiest in that setting I think. Not happiest, but, like, most satisfied (chuckling), most engaged or something (sniffing). So you're saying this is not really a very structured thing? (Chuckling) [0:05:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: You and I may have very different experiences about it. It sounds like you feel... you experience it as less structured than I experience it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Oh, so you experience structure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I mean, I completely see what you're saying, that there are certain parts that are not structured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: But I do think there's ways in which this is a very highly structured environment...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: So it depends on how you look at it. We meet at very definitive times for a specific period of time...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (Sniffing, laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: You usually start, I usually chime in at some point. There are particular things that we talk about that are related to you, and they're often thematic. I feel like, as much as possible I'm quite consistent in sort of my presence...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You know, there's not usually that much variation in terms of... like, I don't come in here sad some days, or at least I don't feel sad and you (ph). So I'm a pretty consistent presence, which I think can also be very structuring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: So, while I agree that there's (inaudible at 0:06:57), it's not like there's a class topic for the day. Although in some ways the class topic is the same every time, which is you. That's the topic. [0:07:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: I feel like there's a lot of structured parts of it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Thank you for sharing that because you're right. Our experiences are different, so... yeah, I get so tied to one way of looking at things that I can really shut myself (chuckling) to other possibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: It is very scary (chuckling) for someone who wants to be creative, you know? Yeah, I wonder why I do that, like, just completely shutting myself off to other possibilities and (sighing)... I try, I (inaudible at 0:07:46) try to put myself in other people's shoes and try to see things from their <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">perspective. And I don't think I do that very well, I mean, unless they're a character I've created, I don't. [0:08:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Well, so tell me more about your reaction to what I said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: No, I liked it. I was very comforted (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: What felt comforting about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: I was very scared that there's no structure, oh no! I always have to talk about me, and I find it so boring or so... too much pressure on to produce something worthwhile. And I was just caught up in that fear. And you're looking at it from a distance and seeing, no, this is a highly structured <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">environment, and there is... look, here, see, feel with me, here are the walls. Here's the roof. Here are the windows, and (chuckling)... I guess it felt a little like that, so... [0:08:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: I don't know. I really like when people show me things that I didn't see, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: We read books... I mean, I read books, and... you know, lots of books. But that just doesn't take away or provide the same kind of magic as seeing something from other person's perspective. I really like it (laughing). And I guess I feel like I really need it in a lot of instances, so... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559384\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Do you feel, if someone isn't providing you with structure or at least as much structure as you'd like, do you feel alone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: How do you mean? [0:10:01] (Laughing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Just like that, [I don't know] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: No, I never thought of it that way, so I'm not sure. Can you give an example (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I don't know. No, actually, I don't know how to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I do. Like, I guess in this scenario I feel alone looking at the problem all by myself and knowing that I was botching (ph) it, you know? I didn't have your peace, and my peace was screwed up and I just couldn't fix it, you know? So yes, I do feel alone. When there's structure <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">and your perspective adds up to mine, it feels more sort of complete, you know? It's a weird connection I guess (chuckling). I don't know why you said that. [0:11:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm trying to understand what is at stake in your providing structure for yourself. Like, does that mean that you're all alone in your life? Like, what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Or what the drawbacks are because I think creativity is... I think people are happiest when they're leading a creative life, and I define creative very, very broadly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: For you you're also looking to live your life, to have creative endeavors in a very specific way as well. It has broad implications, but... so for you it's a particularly difficult challenge for someone who likes structure so much and yet wants to have an open space to create for yourself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">I mean, creativity is almost the antithesis of a structured environment, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: Creating something that's not there, that's what creating is, is creating something that wasn't there before, not filling in the spaces of something that already was. [0:11:59] And so this is such an important life, sort of, vocation or endeavor for you, that this tension is something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">really is important to work out or come to some sort of better resolution around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. I still don't see the problem, though. I mean, I see the problem as in, I sense it, but I don't have clarity about it, like, my need for structure versus my need for open space. I guess maybe it'll help if I define what kind of structure do I need versus what... yeah, I'm not sure (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: The conversation seems too abstract? [0:12:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, abstract as well as I'm just so close to myself and my life and my needs, I don't really know what... you know, okay, this structure's good whereas that structure's very limiting. And I just have feelings and just not enough distance to analyze them as yet. I don't know. I mean it all <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">comes down to Chris (sp?) versus someone else or me and what I try to do and (clearing throat) yeah, I don't know how to articulate it right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well, what if we change structure to a guide? You know, because that's... you've described Chris as providing structure, but in other ways he sort of guides you. These are the values by which you should live by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And that, in many ways, is comforting to you. Oh, okay, these are the values that, you know, he's guiding you and sort of a plan for life, one way to approach life.

Maybe that's how I live my life. I always desire structure and then hate it (chuckling). It's a challenge every single day (chuckling). It just doesn't go away, it just doesn't get better or have more clarity or make my decision <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB1\">and live with it. I'm just not convinced because... and I wonder if I ever will be. Yeah. Like last night we were coming back from (clearing throat) school, and it was 10:00 or something at night. [0:15:03] And we were on the train, and my other classmates were in a different car of the train. And (sighing) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB2\">I wanted to sit with them (chuckling) instead of Chris just because they were talking about literature, and I don't have anyone to talk to about literature with. I should do something about that need, but how (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">So soon as we sat down, I just put on my headphones just because I didn't... I guess I wanted to distance Chris, and yeah, just... I mean he didn't do anything. I was just, like, whatever. So he pulled out his book and started reading, and I was listening to my music. And people started coming in, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">I was observing other people. [0:16:01] And there were these guys who were looking at me from across the train that were in... and they all kind of looked, I don't know, sort of degenerate. Not, you know... nothing wrong with them. They were just... they had moppy hair, and one guy had rolled up his <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD2\">trousers. And I was like, this is so cold outside, what is he doing exposing his ankles? And... but he was looking at me, like, weirdly or whatever. And I wasn't thinking consciously, but I was like... I was just thinking, if I just walked... I mean, got on the train right now, I would probably be put <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD3\">off by those buys and be interested in Chris because he's very prim and proper. It's 10:00 (ph), but everything is in its place, and he was reading this very think, important book (laughing). [0:17:04] But it was like I shut him out, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">Like, he's the idea of my... of how you live life. I'd rather have ambition and hard work, and I think that should be life. But not guys who are exciting or want to have fun, which made me sad because Chris was asking, what do you want to do over the holidays? You want to go on break? And I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">are you kidding me? Have you forgotten how bad it was last year? (Coughing) And so, I mean, I said, basically, this is the thing (ph), like, I want spontaneity and all that, but you are very structured (laughing). [0:18:03] And he said, okay, we can plan for spontaneity (laughing), and I was like, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF2\">is the funniest thing I've heard all day. (Laughing) You should put it online, like, plan for spontaneity. I mean, you've got to laugh with that (laughing), being so him, you know? What do you do with that, you know? He was like, well, what if we don't find a hotel room? You have to plan. I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF3\">you're right (laughing). Good luck with planning spontaneity, you know, see how far you get.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559384\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">So... but that's what I was thinking, that I want openness and limitlessness and (inaudible at 0:18:54) also in someone who I wanted to be with, you know? [0:19:01] But then, you know, that moment on the train where he is the most eligible guy, you know? I mean, not eligible, but... yeah, I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">(Knocking on door)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Don't worry about it, sometimes the UPS person (chuckling)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Oh. Yeah, so I was just like, I'm just never going to resolve this (chuckling), and... (Sighing) And I think about what you say, that why can I not provide whatever, so I guess that is what I'm thinking. Either I provide structure on my own, or I provide spontaneity on my own, which is the thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B71\">that I can provide. And I guess I can provide both, but I'm... [0:20:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess a different... or another dimension to it is if you're the one who's providing it, if it's structure you're providing, it's still spontaneous because it's coming from you. It's still a creative process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: So [what thing is] (ph) structure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm not sort of... maybe spontaneous is the wrong way of saying it, then, because I see the distinction between something that someone else provides for you to fit in versus something you create. And whether the creative act is sort of a responsiveness to your own just wishes, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD1\">more of a... or whether the creative act is something that you plan in a... sort of a plan, they're both creative acts. They're both acts of creativity by definition because they're coming from you and not from somebody else. [0:20:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: You know, when... well, maybe this is true, it's a difference between someone telling you to write a story and this is what the topic should be about, which still gives you a lot of room for creativity but it's providing you with initial structure versus you sitting down and writing a novel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. [I've never done the former] (ph) (chuckling). Well, kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: In school there's probably an element of that, no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: No. I did enter a contest where they had, like... okay, write about [a red sweater] (ph) (chuckling). So I didn't (ph) do that. But yeah, the novel, it's like, I have to create all that structure. [0:21:50] It is daunting, I mean... but I see what you're saying, that it's part of the creative <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">process. And it is actually spontaneous where, you know, you have to be creative and be like, okay, this is on the backburner now. But this topic because of these and these reasons I will work on now. And this is the plan, and, well, in five days I should have a draft or something. So yeah, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C72\">that element is there (sniffing). But I just feel like it won't happen as quickly if I'm not physically close to Chris (chuckling) or... yeah, Chris. Or yeah, school, and there's a lot of danger of just floating. It's so confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">When I wasn't in school, there were dark periods, and then there were very bright periods. [0:23:01] The dark periods were when I was getting rejected (chuckling). And then the bright periods where when I was seeing Victor (sp) and workin (chuckling) as well, so... but there's just a lot of danger of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">me not making a good use of my time. And someone like Chris who is so structured and so hard-working, it feels comforting to (clearing throat) just align myself and my project to him (chuckling). (Pause) [0:23:59] Yeah, I mean I fear quite illegitimately (ph) so that if I'm all by myself then I don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C92\">know if I'll be able to work (chuckling, sniffing).

And I have a tendency to be careless and (chuckling)... (Pause) [0:25:01] I don't know. I feel like I haven't tried it enough (chuckling). Maybe I have tried it enough (sniffing). (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Well, when I think about the idea of floating, one of the reasons one floats is there's not enough substance to keep one to the... rooted to the ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Well, just sort of from a physics metaphor, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: When you're floating, there's not enough substance, or maybe there's not enough gravitational pull. I don't know. But I was thinking, well, what creates this state of floating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah (coughing). [0:26:01] I just have this very visceral reaction, like, really, really, very, very strong negative reaction to thinking about (sniffing) the time when I write something that's utterly crap. I just want to cringe at that, thinking about those days in 2011 when I'd gone part-time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD1\">and (sniffing) Chris had gone to Rhode Island. And there just... I just had my time to do whatever I wanted, like, three days out of the week or more, four days. And I just worked, like, two or three pieces that were just... that went nowhere (chuckling). [0:27:01] I mean, I guess if I'd showed them <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD2\">to a teacher, they'd be like, oh, this is good, that is good. But it's not... they're not as substantive as the piece that I'm working on, and (sniffing) I just feel like, what the hell was I thinking? Why did I do that? Why did I waste my time on those things? Why, why, why? Like, how stupid of me. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD3\">There's absolutely no tenderness that I feel that... but I just had to maybe get those things out of my system, and this is... you know, like things that other writers may say, like, no, you have to write those pages (ph) for you to write the other ones, you know? I just feel no kindness to that, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD4\">I just fear that so much.

There's the value of self-expression. There's the value of valuing what you've expressed, which is something that you struggle with. [0:30:01] And then many people seek out recognition and acknowledgement from others of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">the beauty or goodness of what you've [put down] (ph).

I mean, all those things you're saying are nice, the self-expression and whatever. But it's just really embarrassing (chuckling) to not have that, you know? To tell other people, I'm an artist, and they're like, okay, what have you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">done? And then you're like... (chuckling) you know. [0:31:00] There's stuff here and there in journals (chuckling). What, what was that? And I just start mumbling and walk away. I don't know, I feel like there's so much of it, the pressure comes from being with someone like Chris who's so, I feel, successful. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201112\">And, I mean, maybe I blow up his success a little bit too much. But really, like, yeah, it's embarrassing (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: Well, that's the flip side of looking for someone else for guidance, that you then have a person that you compare to and can maybe surpass or come up... or fall short.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: It's not your own unique, individual endeavor.

I have to do stupid things like go back for a degree that I already have, you know? There're all these... and then there are financial constraints, and there's... it's a big old mess (chuckling).

Okay. Thank you (chuckling). [0:35:58] (Pause) Yeah, I'm not really very... I guess I'm very confused and stuff, but (sighing) I mean, I have chosen [to think] very hard. [0:37:02] I just didn't realize it was that hard, you know? Like, psychologically would <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201511\">be even damaging (chuckling), you know? But I wouldn't... well not (inaudible at 0:37:12), but I don't have the mental strength to deal with the disappointments that this field can bring, you know? Yeah (chuckling). I guess I definitely need help in sorting out all the problems that I've created because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201512\">of my assumptions or my, I don't know, lack of whatever (chuckling). [0:37:59] I don't know yet (clearing throat).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: Well, I think a piece of it is, you're looking for guidance that a parent provides, ideally, that you've never gotten because you're parents were so confused and childlike themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: I suppose. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: You don't have anyone to look up to from your childhood as people who were not only sort of... were lacking in giving you the kind of love and nurturance you need, but models of how to be effective in one's life and in the world. Both your parents were sort of defeated by life in their different <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201571\">ways, not entirely...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: But they certainly didn't exhibit a kind of mastery. [0:38:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: But I do have teachers, and I could look up to them (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yes, you have definitely created an environment where you do have people, and you do seek that out. And I'm simply pointing out something that was lacking in your past, which has a deep impression at a time in one's life that they really need that guidance because they're just little kids. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F1\">And I think you feel that lack and bring that lack into different situations. And this is not to put a negative spin on it, because I think your ability to make use of what other people can provide you is a strength.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2015E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559384\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20161\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20163\">THERAPIST: But since you're adult and not a child, you also have a sense of your own needs and your own cravings to create for yourself and not simply rely on how other people do it. And so you're constantly feeling that tension. [0:39:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20165\">CLIENT: Hmm. You mean, like, why am I relying on Chris so much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Well, the why is interesting, but also that tension between feeling so safe and secure in that structure and at times feeling like it's suffocating and it's not allowing you to be you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">THERAPIST: It's like you were saying... did you move, by the way? Did you move out of the apartment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">CLIENT: Not completely. They're not... they haven't found someone they like yet (chuckling). It was going to happen, but it fell through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">THERAPIST: [Got it] (ph). Well, that's probably... it's a related discussion, but it's kind of like your describing that room as a place you actually love, but that it's too much you, which is itself an interesting expression, too much of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">CLIENT: yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">THERAPIST: And so... but there's clearly an appeal to it. It wasn't like a horrible, scary place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">CLIENT: No (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">THERAPIST: But then... so there's that piece of you, and then there's a piece of you that wants to sort of go right to Chris and have him tell you how to live life or have him be a model for how to live life. [0:41:07] And then feeling inadequate when you're not doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the more you talk about it, the more I'm like, wow, this is... I really, really need Chris (chuckling). There's really no denying it. I can be in denial, and, oh! I'm just crashing at his place, and that's how I'm explaining it. But I really need him (chuckling) <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201791\">to be him. But it's not that I... doesn't mean that I stop criticizing how structured he is (chuckling). [0:41:55] (Pause) I don't know. (Sighing) (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Well, that's actually not entirely what I said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">CLIENT: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">THERAPIST: I said that, on the one hand, you feel you need him, and then, on the other hand, there's a part of you that feels there's a lot of beauty in creating something for yourself, but that it's a conflict.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">CLIENT: No, I see that there is beauty in creating something for myself, but there's all this fear of not getting there, falling short, of going astray, of wasting time, is that I need (sighing) that wall, you know (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [0:42:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">CLIENT: But yeah, I feel that, that I need it and cannot create my own walls or get so afraid that I don't see that I can create my own walls. (Pause) So much work to be done, like... I'm turning into Chris (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">CLIENT: That's... I think that is his... that's his wall right there, you know? That is how he creates structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">THERAPIST: That there's so much to be done?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah, overwhelmed by work. That's him (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Does my suggestion for you to come in an extra time, does that feel overwhelming?

It's good to be overwhelmed. I'm learning to like being overwhelmed by stuff to get done (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Well, I don't want to encourage you to be overwhelmed, that's not my goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) No, well, I don't know. How can I describe it? Like, it's good to be overwhelmed. It's good to... isn't it? Like, you feel important, you feel there's a purpose, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">THERAPIST: That's certainly a piece of feeling overwhelmed, is that there are a lot of things that are important for you to do and accomplish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop, and [I want to] (ph)... so what would you like to do? Do you want to... you know, about the extra time, do you want to talk about it next week, or what would you like to do? Do you want to just sort of visit next week, and then we can figure out a schedule from there? [0:45:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">CLIENT: Sure, whatever works for you, I mean, if you want to... because usually you like to e-mail me times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019F\">THERAPIST: I can. The other piece of it is that I think that the third session...this is... we should... I should take more time to spend than (ph) talk about this in the end of the session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">THERAPIST: But I think the third session I would not bill the insurance. I have a feeling that they may reject it. Sometimes if you come to many times a week and you bill the insurance, it's sort of flagged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">THERAPIST: So it's not clear that they're going to deny it, but I think it would be better for that extra time a week if we just work something out. I don't know, in addition to the co-pay with the $70 you were paying before, is that something you could do, you know, pay that $70?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: Not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Or would that be too much?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's because, I mean, if I got rid of the apartment, then I could work something out. But yeah, right now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Well, if you pay the $70 total, the extra session and the two co-pays, would that work out? I'm just going according to what you were paying before. [0:46:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. So $70 plus...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">THERAPIST: No, so if you do the $70, which would include the extra session and the two $10 co-pays, is that something you could do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I have to see because that would be $70 per week, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not sure right now because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Take a look at... let's try to... I mean, if it's something you really feel would be helpful, we'll figure something out. So let me know... does it make sense, though, with the insurance? I just am concerned they're not going to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">THERAPIST: So think about your budget, and we'll... because, if you feel it will be helpful, then I do think I want to try to make something work for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, but, I mean, if I had that job, I would totally do it (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">CLIENT: But right now, yeah.
