That would be like getting started six months ago. Jesus Christ. And then I was paranoid because I was in JP and there is no easy way to get back here. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to sit here. (chuckling) I refuse to drive right now.\u201d Oh, my God. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">Which was good; very wise. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting that you\u2019ve been drinking less, too. Maybe we haven\u2019t talked about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve mentioned it before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: A little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve just been staying home more and I don\u2019t drink at home. Probably in Assyria \u2013 it\u2019s weird \u2013 when I\u2019m not in the country, I will drink at home a little more; but even then . . . In Europe people drink more \u2013 I guess like a 40. Beers come in bigger . . . One of those, maybe.  There is something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">about just being alone drinking. What the fuck is the point? I\u2019ve just been staying home. And then when I go to George\u2019s, those guys don\u2019t really drink; or if they do, they have a sip of Corona. Tomorrow we\u2019re all meeting at a bar, more of a bigger get-together, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to drive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">I think I\u2019m just going to take a taxi because if this is how it is with two beers \u2013 yeah. But it\u2019s also interesting. It\u2019s also kind of sad. I kind of cried in the car and shit because I met with my friend, Allison, who I have feelings for, and it was kind of interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">We had a pretty honest . . . That was good, too. It was sad because she\u2019s one of these people who is awesome, but she\u2019s one of these fuck feelings people.  She\u2019s scared of her feelings. She\u2019s divorced and all this shit, but it was kind of cool to just be honest with her because she was like, \u201cWait. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">We haven\u2019t hung out because you tried to make me your girlfriend.\u201d I was like, \u201cI didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to not be honest about having feelings for you. I really like you. It wasn\u2019t like I just was attracted to you; I really like you, but that has nothing to do with hanging out. I\u2019m a big boy. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">the flaky one. I don\u2019t hear back.\u201d She was like, \u201cI know. I\u2019m a dick. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d (laughing) It was a pretty honest thing. It ended a little awkward because we both got buzzed. She got really buzzed, I think.  She\u2019s feisty, so she was like, \u201cAre you like this? Do you just pine for women?\u201d I was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">\u201cWhat? Go fuck yourself. I\u2019ve got a roster of chicks I like. I pine after the ones I really care about, which is rare.\u201d So we got into this whole thing. It was really interesting. It was an interesting night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">If this was six months or a year ago, right now I would be all bummed here, do you know what I mean? Today. But I had a little bit of a cry. I was sitting in my car. I didn\u2019t want to drive. I was in JP. I got a little pissed like why did I even hang out with this chick? But, no, I really like her. She\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">a good person. She doesn\u2019t have to be in love with me. But at the same time, I\u2019m not going to pretend, if I have feelings.  That\u2019s when it\u2019s hard. I feel like I\u2019m so ahead of the game now. You can talk about feelings and it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge deal. It\u2019s amazing how people can\u2019t. Just now she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">texting and she\u2019s like, \u201cHey, thanks for not being a tool last night.\u201d I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. From one dick to another. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d Then I was like, \u201cI can have feelings for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about the friendship. The friendship is important.\u201d She was like, \u201cFeelings are <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">overrated.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, by people that are scared of them.\u201d (laughs) She was like, \u201cOh, please.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m scared of them, too, but it\u2019s nonsense. You have feelings all day long. You\u2019re a fucking musician. Why don\u2019t you write joke songs if you don\u2019t like feelings?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855936\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">It started because she said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d I said, \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, please. I told you I\u2019m seeing somebody.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, I thought you were just dating.\u201d She was telling me about this dude. He went to Costa Rica to get new teeth. Right there, I was like, See? That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">fine. You\u2019re one of those. That\u2019s okay.\u201d \u201cOne of those what?\u201d I was like, \u201cCome on, man. You\u2019re 40. You have a boyfriend that went to Costa Rica to get new teeth? Listen to yourself.\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t judge me.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not judging. We all make fucked-up choices. Maybe it\u2019s really cheap to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">teeth in Costa Rica, but just the idea. There is something about that. Someone is getting a whole new set of teeth and they\u2019re going to Costa Rica to do that? Something is clearly . . . Maybe he\u2019s an awesome, awesome dude that\u2019s going to be great to your kid, but it just sounds wacky.\u201d So that\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B3\">of how it started.  I had a little good cry and then I drove. I was actually fine. I took a walk, too. I took a walk; got back in the car; went to Mickey D\u2019s. I haven\u2019t done that in a very, very long time. And even that was kind of cool because I was like you know what? I\u2019m really hungry. I hadn\u2019t eaten <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B4\">dinner. That was the other thing; I hadn\u2019t eaten dinner. Every penny now, I\u2019m thinking about these things. You know what? I\u2019d rather pay $5 and stuff my face than spend $20 buying all these groceries or $30. I\u2019m leaving in a few days. Whatever. That\u2019s no excuse to eat at McDonalds, but even that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B5\">a little bit different than how I would have gone to McDonalds before. Do you know what I mean? Of course, I felt like shit. I didn\u2019t sleep very well, but I feel all right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s so cool about your exchange with her and that you\u2019re able to persist in knowing that she\u2019s scared when she tries to sort of say that feelings are for losers. You just say right back no, that\u2019s not true; and it doesn\u2019t perturb your comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. There is definitely something different. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s as if all of these things are happening symbolically now, like this article, the essay I wrote, and these girl things are happening. It\u2019s kind of good, I think. Remember the Assyria girl in Halifax? Out of the blue, she started <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">e-mailing me again. She\u2019s in Dublin now. It\u2019s like, okay, and it really quickly developed into her flirting with me and said, \u201cDamn it. I\u2019m still really attracted to you.\u201d And this and that. I kind of went with it. Then she video-chatted me.  I was like, whoa, I don\u2019t like shit like that. It\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">of weird. But all right, fine. I\u2019m thinking something totally different \u2013 like we\u2019re going to talk and maybe, not reignite, but maybe see where things go, and she\u2019s telling me she\u2019s not interested. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way anymore.\u201d So we ended it. I was like wait a second. So I wrote to her and was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">\u201cYou know what? You e-mailed me. You flirted with me. Then you video-chatted me. All of that to tell me that you have no feelings and aren\u2019t interested? Don\u2019t ever contact me again. That\u2019s really lame; really lame.\u201d She wrote me something back. She was like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I didn\u2019t even answer back. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F4\">like, dude, you can\u2019t. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855936\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">I think even when I kind of cried last night, it wasn\u2019t because of her. It\u2019s because it sucks a little bit. You\u2019re not better than other people, but you\u2019re seeing certain things that they\u2019re not seeing; and that\u2019s kind of lonely a little bit because so many people are like that. Sometimes I\u2019m still <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">like that. I don\u2019t know. When you work hard on yourself and you actually do get a little bit slightly more aware and enlightened, it\u2019s like Jesus Christ, everybody, from my uncle to the chick to the this to everyone is just battling their own. It\u2019s lonely a little bit, but it\u2019s the healthier way to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200212\">be. I\u2019d rather have a little cry in the car and now be okay and feel solid.  But there have been a few like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: I also think your capacity to recognize other people\u2019s limitations and capacities will increasingly start to get in, not a defensive way, but put your guard up in an adaptive way more. When she says \u201cpining after women,\u201d I think there have been relationships, maybe her or not, where you can <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">get into a kind of bubble that pushes away what you know about her. And the more you take that with you, it is lonelier, in a way, because you can\u2019t escape knowing that this person has limitations. You might not follow as quickly or for as many.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the thing. You can tell someone, \u201cI have feelings for you, but I\u2019m calling you on this shit and I\u2019m not pining after you. If I was pining after you, I\u2019d be touching base with you all the time. Clearly, I\u2019m not.\u201d  With Samantha I was, right? Although, even with her I tried. There were <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">those few times when I was like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to go,\u201d but I wasn\u2019t strong enough so she would just kind of \u201cdon\u2019t go; I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And then I would get suckered back in thinking, \u201cOh, see? She loves me.\u201d And no, of course she doesn\u2019t. But now it\u2019s not like that, especially with Allison. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">I haven\u2019t even talked about her in here because I just know. I know what the deal is, but I also know that Allison is actually a little bit unusual because I honestly haven\u2019t . . . We really, really, I think, click. It\u2019s a really deep kind of clicking, to the point where I think that that even scared <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200253\">her before I mentioned that I had feelings for her.  The very first time that we met just for drinks, we were both kind of taken aback by it. Weird, little things. Like yesterday, out of the blue, she\u2019s showing me her new kitchen. We have very similar tastes and this and that and whatever, but in her <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200254\">kitchen she was like, \u201cLook at this clock. Do you know what that is?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHoly shit. That\u2019s Charles Grodin. I love Charles Grodin.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cNo shit? I love Charles Grodin.\u201d Who loves Charles Grodin? Who talks about Charles Grodin? Do you remember him? Yeah. Then I told her about when I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200255\">a kid and all the times he used to be on Letterman and I remember all their little, weird things. I used to love him. That\u2019s weird. You\u2019re not going to fall in love with someone over their Charles Grodin clock, but I\u2019m saying we have a lot of these, just our demeanor.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855936\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: That align.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. Even the fact of \u201cfuck feelings.\u201d I say that, too, but now I know that I\u2019m just faking that sentiment.  So it\u2019s one thing after another. We\u2019re just very in sync. But I knew this is going to go nowhere. She almost immediately started back-pedaling. For a little while she would post shit <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200291\">on my Facebook. She was calling me from her business trips, which I think I mentioned to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve mentioned that, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: That just stopped because it got kind of real. We were forming a real connection. So once that happened, I didn\u2019t pursue it. Once in a while it would be like, \u201cHey, remember when we talked once in a while?\u201d But I just stopped. Then yesterday she was like, \u201cHow am I supposed to respond when sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D1\">you just text me like \u2018hey,\u2019 like one word?\u201d  I was like, \u201cHow am I supposed to respond when I never hear from you? What do you want me to do, send you a . . ? I don\u2019t kiss anybody\u2019s ass. I\u2019m not going to chase you, but once in a while, I\u2019m just trying to be somewhat of a friend.\u201d It\u2019s all good. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D2\">not going to feel weird about anything right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: In spite of what she was going to try to convince you of what was happening, you persisted in having yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: Even \u2013 we had two beers and when we were done with those two, I was like, \u201cI should probably go. I\u2019ve got to get up really, really early.\u201d I was fine. I got up; I put my jacket on and I put my hat on and I was like, \u201cYou know what?\u201d We were kind of joking. She was peeing all the time \u2013 not all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">the time, but I was joking like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to catch up with you. I\u2019ve got to piss one more time.\u201d So I come back and she had ordered two more beers. So it\u2019s like look, why don\u2019t you just go home? You can\u2019t do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: [She\u2019s in a deep conflict about it.] (ph?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s a weeknight. You don\u2019t have to have that extra beer. Clearly you\u2019re having a good time. Meanwhile, that essay: I hadn\u2019t thought about this, but yesterday I went with my Assyrian friends, which was really sweet. They got me sushi yesterday. The Fish Market \u2013 have you been there? Do <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">you know where the music hall is? [Decals,] (ph?) that shitty . . ? Across from it there is a place called at the fish market. It might be one of the top two best sushi I\u2019ve ever had. You should go there. We were getting sushi and Jeff, one of the guys \u2013 oh, no. I mentioned my essay because this woman <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200352\">I know, who knows my mom, wrote a rambling, bizarre comment. She was like, \u201cI remember you when you were a teenager and you used to come to our house. You\u2019re Marla\u2019s cousin.  I feel sad for you that you\u2019re so angry and envious of successful people.\u201d These Assyrian immigrants, they can\u2019t \u2013 \u201chow dare <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200353\">you criticize success?\u201d They totally misread everything I read there, but a couple were like that. \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d \u201cPeople have worked very hard for what they have.\u201d Blah-blah-blah. So I was telling him about that and was like, \u201cDude, do you remember that woman who really . . ?\u201d He was reading it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200354\">he was like, \u201cHoly \u2013 what the fuck is she talking about?\u201d So then he started checking. That essay has something like 30 comments, which is like 29 more than any other essay on that website. I hadn\u2019t thought about that, but that\u2019s pretty cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855936\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20037\">THERAPIST: Wow, that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20039\">CLIENT: Most of them had zero comments. Yeah, pretty neat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s pretty extreme. It\u2019s not just a few more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s a lot more. And 99% were very lovely, really gracious, lovely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">THERAPIST: To really have an impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, pretty cool. Very cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20043\">THERAPIST: Again, Brian, I think even what you were talking about with Allison in the conversation, or with publishing, it\u2019s like trusting your mind for once and for all. Knowing what you know and even being willing to sustain that some people aren\u2019t going to like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s the other funny thing. For the first five minutes, because I\u2019ve never had that, I was like whoa \u2013 what the fuck? But yeah, I\u2019m clearly not going to make a comment, say anything, write fucking something in response. That\u2019s not me \u2013 because you can\u2019t win that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20047\">THERAPIST: No, and that\u2019s part of it. There will always be someone who doesn\u2019t like every person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: Me. Yeah, that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Every one of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Not every girl is going to like me; not every person is going to like me. And guess what? I don\u2019t like most people, so it works out perfectly well. It feels good. I\u2019ve got to say, it feels really good \u2013 especially with that one e-mail from Sterling, the guy from University of Hartford I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D1\">say enough what that means because how ironic that that was the very kind of person I thought I wasn\u2019t smart enough and I couldn\u2019t speak their language; and this guy sits down and writes a five-paragraph letter about an essay that yeah, I worked hard on it, but I didn\u2019t think it was . . .  Rereading <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D2\">it, I already see things that I would do differently or that I would expand, so that\u2019s a big deal. That says it all to me. And I told him that when I wrote back. He was like, \u201cI really hope that we can keep up our correspondence.\u201d I said, \u201cIt means a lot to have people like you.\u201d He mentioned this other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D3\">guy, Joseph, who I know. This guy was the Foreign Minister of Assyria. He is an American Assyrian academic. These intellectual guys become \u2013 or at least they tried in Assyria \u2013 and he\u2019s a big deal, this guy. He lives here in Baltimore. A very nice man, brilliant. So in the e-mail, Sterling was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D4\">\u201cPeople like me and Joseph have talked about how it\u2019s people like you. It\u2019s a shitty outlook right now so the few people like you, when I see something like this, it makes us feel like maybe it\u2019s not all lost.\u201d  I told him, \u201cPeople like you, who are experienced and so thoughtful, that means everything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D5\">It\u2019s very gracious.\u201d That felt good to be like hey \u2013 I\u2019m going to be teaching at AUA down the road. Not right now, but he was like, \u201cWould you be interested in coming? We could do a little talk or I could do an interview of you?\u201d (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like the central question is would you rather be liked or known? I think it so much used to be \u201cliked\u201d and it\u2019s becoming \u201cknown,\u201d even if it means what people know, they do or don\u2019t like.  It doesn\u2019t matter very much anymore whether they do. It\u2019s being yourself and then getting to really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">discover that some people really, really like you.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855936\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20051\">CLIENT: It even felt good to tell him. It\u2019s a long story, but I met with Sterling when I was thinking about PhDs because I wanted to go to Johnson &amp; Wales University and his girlfriend teaches in the English Department at Johnson &amp; Wales University. We met in Portsmouth and, when I look back on that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200511\">I\u2019m very embarrassed because that was when this is not what I was. I could tell that was a time when I felt like he did probably see me as kind of confused and not with it or something. That\u2019s the impression I got. I don\u2019t know. Because he didn\u2019t really help me. Oh, my God. Then at Brown, at one point, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200512\">when they asked him to be my outside advisor because of this asshole, he even told me \u2013 that\u2019s right \u2013 he even wrote me \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re doing, kind of.\u201d He was kind of blunt. He was like, \u201cYou\u2019re doing poetry and now you\u2019re there. You\u2019re trying to be . . .\u201d It was very hurtful. I\u2019m just remembering <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200513\">this now. So imagine now, do you know what I mean? Now it\u2019s like he\u2019s writing to me. Why? Not because I finished at Brown, but because I\u2019m just being me and I\u2019m owning the fact that I\u2019m a pretty good writer and I don\u2019t need Sterling or this douchebag or that degree to do what I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">THERAPIST: Even then, Brian, he\u2019s being brave enough to say something honest and you\u2019re not falling in line with \u201coh, you really should get your Brown degree.\u201d He\u2019s not saying that. He\u2019s saying, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s you and I\u2019m not sure you know if this is you,\u201d Which is true. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">CLIENT: He was not just saying \u201csure I\u2019ll be your advisor.\u201d He was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re focused.\u201d No, it was hurtful, but I don\u2019t think he meant it in a hurtful way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">THERAPIST: Hard to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">CLIENT: Even at the time I knew he was right. It pissed me off, but I knew he was right. I was going to say that it felt good when I responded to his initial e-mail. I was very honest with him because he said, \u201cBy the way, where are you? What are you doing now? I don\u2019t know where you live?\u201d I just told <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">him it\u2019s kind of a long story, but I talked about London and this and that and my book. I said I\u2019ve come to find out in the last year that I\u2019ve been struggling with some PTSD for like 20 years.  I said I knew something was up and I had been really trying to better myself and this and that. I said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200592\">in the past year a lot of things have crystalized and I said that I \u2018ve never felt more \u2013 I don\u2019t know how I said it \u2013 I think I said it feels like a fog has lifted. It\u2019s just a really lovely and energizing feeling. It just felt good to tell him that, whether that makes sense to him or not, just to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200593\">be like \u201cthere was shit going on that I can\u2019t begin to explain to you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Also that you were explaining what he was picking up \u2013 that that is where you were and that\u2019s not where you are now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: Also that I can talk about these things. In the past I was like \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Talking about it, in a way, is an example of being tested. If you can name it and say \u201cthis is what happened,\u201d it\u2019s not frightening anymore. It doesn\u2019t have to be.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2855936\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about this, but yesterday mom got this kind of sad look on her face and was like, \u201cSon, what do you want to do about grandma? Now you don\u2019t want to see her before you go?\u201d Ohhh. That\u2019s tough. I don\u2019t know what to do, but I also told her, \u201cMom, my conscious is <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200611\">clean. I saw the woman pretty much every day. Why don\u2019t my other cousins go see her? I\u2019ve seen her every day.\u201d She\u2019s my grandmother, do you know what I mean? I\u2019m going to go see her and say goodbye and she\u2019s going to forget that I was there.  So in a way, which one is better? A loss is a loss. If I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200612\">go see her for half an hour and then leave, what is that doing, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s a question. What is it doing, for example, when people visit an open casket? That they want that last time, what is that? It doesn\u2019t change the loss. It\u2019s not even known to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">CLIENT: In a way I feel like things like that are slightly selfish. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like wakes. I don\u2019t do wakes. I know other countries have them, too, but the American style of wakes I find really, really crass. A weird building where, really, people just end up socializing. Whereas in other countries, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200651\">if you want to do a fucking wake that casket is in your house.  My mom and all these guys have stories about being little and the dead person is in the living room and if you want a wake, there is your wake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">THERAPIST: Even not a wake, whatever is (crosstalk at 00:27:13) What is it worth? Is it worth anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: In this case, I don\u2019t know because if I hadn\u2019t seen her for years and years . . . Every fucking day she was in our living room, so I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m getting out of . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Closure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: The closure of what? For who?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: For you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, but what\u2019s the closure? I\u2019m still going to have the same feelings. If I see her for half an hour and then leave, what\u2019s the closure? She\u2019s still alive. She doesn\u2019t know that that\u2019s closure, so I\u2019m not sure. Because I already feel like I have the closure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">THERAPIST: You wouldn\u2019t have regrets, in other words, is what you\u2019re saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20075\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure what the regret would be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20077\">THERAPIST: If she died in the next few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20079\">CLIENT: Right, but what would be the regret? She wouldn\u2019t know that she saw me that last time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">THERAPIST: For you.

That\u2019s where I think I have this toughness. I feel like I\u2019ve already braced myself for that. It would be different if it was someone who is with it who I didn\u2019t make effort to see a last time because they actually know that they\u2019re seeing me and I\u2019m going to Assyria. Someone <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200811\">who doesn\u2019t understand that, I don\u2019t know. Also, I worry that if I see her, if my aunt is there, I don\u2019t want any of the stuff that happened . . . I don\u2019t want any issues. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to do. I thought about writing her a letter in Assyria and having my mom read that to her or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">THERAPIST: Maybe you\u2019re scared of something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019ve braced myself, so I feel like I don\u2019t want to reopen what I\u2019ve already kind of made peace with. I\u2019ve made peace with it. Because I know there is no easy way. If I see her that last time it\u2019s not going to be like, \u201cWhew, I saw her one more time and now she doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200851\">even know she saw me. I just left the building.\u201d I\u2019m still going to feel shitty if she passes away, so that feeling isn\u2019t going to change. I already feel shitty that I\u2019m losing my grandmother. (pause) I\u2019m not sure what to do about it. I guess I could tell my mom . . . I also don\u2019t want it to trigger <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200852\">my mom getting sucked back in. That\u2019s the thing. I feel like right now my mom has got her free time; she\u2019s doing her thing.  I don\u2019t want this to somehow . . . There is no win-win situation, in other words. I did what I had to do. It kind of sucks now because it\u2019s created an icy situation, but I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200853\">to do what I had to do and I\u2019m willing to deal with that.

I\u2019ve never seen a tough lady like this. Somehow <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200911\">there is a part of me that\u2019s like \u201cit\u2019s not the last time I\u2019ll see her.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20093\">THERAPIST: And yet, when it comes from that place, that would be the place that would have the most regret if it happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20095\">CLIENT: Right, that\u2019s true.
