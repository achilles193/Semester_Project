I [inaudible 00:04:16] a lot of jobs and they [inaudible 00:04:21] getting rejection, like it\u2019s kind of really pissing me off because I feel like I\u2019m kind of over qualified for these jobs. But then rejection letters [inaudible 00:04:33]. \u201cWe\u2019ve found other candidates that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">are more qualified than you.\u201d And I\u2019m applying to like mid-level two positions or whatever I used to do [inaudible 00:04:46]. So I feel a little bit, kind of dismayed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">There\u2019s a place that I\u2019m continuing to interview with. Like I\u2019ve had three, four interviews with them and they\u2019re like, \u201cBefore we bring you in, you\u2019ll need to do this assignment.\u201d It\u2019s substantial. It\u2019s like they want me to write a long post on like the manufacturing industry and I just don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">anything about it. So\u2026I\u2019m like, I\u2019m a little worried as to whether\u2026but it\u2019s a full-time job and what if I do get it and then I get something good and I get stressed out by it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Then I won\u2019t be able to write it and I feel like a critical jump [inaudible 00:05:44].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">But then I\u2019m like, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I consider that a challenge and like try and see how much I\u2019ve grown in the past few years and see how I can hold down a full-time job and feel I\u2019m being responsible financially and be active instead of being passive and you know, like\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Yeah. Take control of my finances so I don\u2019t feel kind of hopeless like I do right now, instead of take control of things, and try and use my time wisely and make time for writing, even when I\u2019m in a full-time job. I feel like this idea of me just being active and in control and determined and facing challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">But I feel like maybe that [inaudible 00:06:56] and I decided it\u2019s not taking reality into consideration, which might look a bit different. Like it may look like I\u2019m stressed by the job and feeling trapped or feeling incompetent and feeling even more kind of dismayed because I cannot do something, when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">it\u2019s completely new for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">Then I\u2019m like, \u201cOn the other hand, it would be a challenge and it would make me feel so much better if I can prove myself that I can do this.\u201d [inaudible 00:07:36] this writing assignment will kind of not just let them know that I can do it, but let me know, which is more important, but can I do it? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">Do I want to do it?\u201d I don\u2019t know. I guess I am worried, \u201cWell what if I feel trapped?\u201d [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">I had an interview with just like a recruitment place and she\u2019s like a girl with a thin voice and maybe younger than me. But I still felt weird and intimidated just by it was like a bland, white room, which they have you sit and lock the door and such. She\u2019s asking simple questions and I just didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">really know how to respond even though I know this stuff really well and I feel like no one can do a better job at this than me. It feels that way, but still you know, I\u2019m like out of touch with the terminology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">So she must be like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to send her to places that are like, \u2018What the hell is wrong with these places?\u201d Don\u2019t they see? I mean doesn\u2019t it mean anything to have the kinds of experience I have and doesn\u2019t it show that I can do\u2026a large number of things. I can do them well. It doesn\u2019t\u2026so what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">if my terminology\u2019s a bit rusty? Can I not take a day or two to learn?\u201d But other than that, everyone has to be super confident and make super on the ball. That\u2019s just fake.

Because you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like they\u2019re challenging you and you feel very angry they\u2019re challenging you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: You see it as a challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. But how else should I see it? [Laughs] [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: Well they\u2019re evaluating whether you\u2019re a good fit. They\u2019re not trying to pick a fight with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: [Laughs] Yeah. I know. That\u2019s just like bull shit. \u201cAre you a good fit?\u201d You know? What the hell does that mean? I guess like my resume is, I think, stellar. It\u2019s pretty decent. So it\u2019s like\u2026I don\u2019t know. [Laughs] I\u2019m not mad at the way that\u2019s interviewing me. It\u2019s just a bit weird that we\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">had three phone interviews just like they\u2019re still in, \u201c [inaudible 00:10:55], bring your [inaudible 00:10:53].\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat?\u201d I mean I\u2019ve never had that. Like I\u2019ve only had face-to-face interviews. So it\u2019s just a bit weird to me, but I\u2019m not angry at them because I get that they\u2026both of us need <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">to know whether we\u2019re a good fit or not. But like people who are turning me down for jobs that I\u2019ve already done. Like I\u2019ve done them at a managerial level as well. You know, like the [inaudible 00:11:20] level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">Those placements I feel like are full of shit because\u2026those I\u2019m angry about with because they don\u2019t even want to evaluate\u2026I don\u2019t even know what [inaudible 00:11:31]. [Laughs] Maybe I\u2019m not a good fit. For some weird reason they don\u2019t care to tell me about. [inaudible 00:11:41] that standard rejection <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">letters. I mean there\u2019s been like one person who rejected and kind of said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have experience with this specific area.\u201d And I get that [inaudible 00:11:52] like that. [inaudible 00:11:58].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just struck by how many feelings this evokes for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah. I cannot be [inaudible 00:12:18] emotional a lot for some reason. I don\u2019t know. [Pause] But I do this sort of stuff on like a weekly basis or as a volunteer and at other places. So I feel like I might as well get paid for this. I guess I\u2019ve been trying not to care so much and focus on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">the positives, the acceptance, and the interviews rather than the rejection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">And I am kind of bored by the same stuff anyway. Maybe that\u2019s [inaudible 00:13:16]. I don\u2019t know. I would like something new so. [Pause] It\u2019s just like money. I\u2019m extremely worried because I need to make money for that [inaudible 00:13:43] what I\u2019m going to do and [inaudible 00:13:47] I just feel ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">[inaudible 00:13:51] told me that he helped my mom with her rent for this month and she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should take your help.\u201d But then he\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with you and me. You know. We agree.\u201d I\u2019m still thinking of the sort of thing where he makes me forget and then [inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">00:14:21]. Yeah. [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, you know, like I feel like [inaudible 00:14:31] doesn\u2019t really care and I have rationalized it and have made myself not care that he doesn\u2019t care. You know. So. But I\u2019m not like freaking out about it for some reason. I\u2019m just like not thinking about it. So. Just keep to my regular friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">and that\u2019s what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562634\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">Like I didn\u2019t hear at all from him on Monday, the day that I came back from Ohio to D.C. And it was like, [inaudible 00:15:15] even Graham wasn\u2019t nagging. He called up all the time and that one time. But you know, [inaudible 00:15:24] someone comes to visit you and you kind of send them a taxi. \u201cI hope <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">you got back okay. [inaudible 00:15:31]. It was great having you,\u201d or whatever. It was kind of not saying that made me kind of go, \u201cSee? You don\u2019t care.\u201d [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">And then on Monday, I was having dinner with my mom and on the phone, she\u2019s telling me about her friend who\u2019s kind of in trouble and they\u2019re saying her landlord is kicking her out and told her to vacate by the end of the month, and she\u2019s like\u2026she\u2019s a bit disabled. She has a problem with her knees. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">she walks with crutches and she lost her job last year and it\u2019s terrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">I feel like I know this section of the world or like [inaudible 00:16:21]. You know, like I know people who are kind of helpless in situations like this where they don\u2019t have money, where they\u2019re like living hand-to-mouth, and you know, I need to respond with a lot of empathy and a lot of kindness and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">care. I might not want to. It might depress the hell out of me, but I have to not\u2026I have to look at it in a positive way and with a service attitude, like what can I do without\u2026[inaudible 00:17:03] completely not part of that world at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">[inaudible 00:17:04] texted yesterday and was like, \u201cI\u2019m coming back early. Let\u2019s party.\u201d I\u2019m just like, \u201cYeah. Let\u2019s\u2026\u201d Like when I\u2019m thinking about this woman who\u2019s being kicked out of her house. I\u2019m so not thinking about drinking and partying. So that feels like such a dichotomy, two very different worlds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">I don\u2019t know. I guess it was just prompted by I saw my friend in Ohio. She used to be\u2026she wasn\u2019t dating for the longest time. Well she was, but just casually and then she met one guy and they went out like eight months. And the day that she thought they were going together and discuss moving in together <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">or something. You know, like the next step forward, he kind of broke up with her so. She was very, very upset about it. It was like two years. And then, now she\u2019s met this awesome guy and it\u2019s like they just got engaged and they\u2019ve been going out for two years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">The whole time I hung out with them, they were holding hands. It was like\u2026and she\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. He makes me completely happy.\u201d I was very happy for her, you know, but then I was also a little sad because of my very pathetic situation. I told Amelia that it was me, because she was like, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">very curious and he wants to get to know things.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, but you don\u2019t know like the back\u2026what\u2019s going on in the background.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">\u201cWe only see each on the weekends and this is like a very weird relationship.\u201d [inaudible 00:19:07]. \u201cWe party and we don\u2019t even\u2026it\u2019s not even a weekend [inaudible 00:19:11] because it\u2019s like we don\u2019t have sex.\u201d And you know, I [inaudible 00:19:20] paying my mom\u2019s rent, but it\u2019s like so complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">Yeah. I feel like I really just don\u2019t see a future with [inaudible 00:19:36] because we don\u2019t have much in common. And while that I thought was a little exciting, we don\u2019t need to have things [inaudible 00:19:47]. Just need to have attraction or something, but I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Like once we <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">get older, we\u2019ll be [inaudible 00:20:03] wear off and everything and we need to talk to each other and what will we say to each other.

In terms of a relationship [inaudible 00:21:42] like one person making her completely happy. And I do think when she said that, I thought, \u201cWell <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200591\">I\u2019ve been there and that\u2019s like a fallacy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">Another person cannot make you completely happy.

But [inaudible 00:22:52], I\u2019m constantly kind of does make me go there and then \u201cWhat am I doing with this other <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">guy? You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">And my new friend. He\u2019s always like, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you\u2026\u201d Like five or six [inaudible 00:23:09] later, he\u2019s like an open topic for discussion amongst a bunch of friends. [Laughs] [pause] I guess what you\u2019re trying to chart up my kind of progression of thought from feeling entitled to feeling like I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">have any\u2026I guess, I just think of them as two extremes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Maybe and also somehow that they\u2019re related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: How are they related?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: [inaudible 00:24:12]. Well is it unhealthy to feel entitled?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: [inaudible 00:24:32].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I absolutely think it\u2019s a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Oh why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: To feel that people owe you things. I think that\u2019s a problem. I do. Especially people who have no relationship to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. [laughs] I don\u2019t know what to say to that. [laughs] [pause] I guess it comes from the feeling of lack maybe, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why I go there and get into that mode. [pause] Yeah. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">I guess it just comes from like a sense of fear that if not this, then what? You know? Like if I don\u2019t get this, then I won\u2019t get anything. And like I\u2019m thinking \u201cYou have to do this for me.\u201d Or \u201cYou have to help me. Otherwise, what am I gonna do?\u201d [inaudible 00:26:22]. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">that. Like I have applied to so many things. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562634\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">Like maybe 20, 25 by now. So like three or four or five places say no. There\u2019s still no [inaudible 00:26:53] application. Then like one is actively progressing toward some end. You know? But I don\u2019t understand why I feel angry about those few rejections. Isn\u2019t it\u2026like that\u2019s not healthy, but I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">feeling angry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: No. It really isn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like, you know, a healthy dose of pride or anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: No, because they haven\u2019t done anything to you. Being angry implies that they\u2019ve done something to you. [pause] A healthy dose of pride is, \u201cWell since I have these talents, someone will recognize them. It didn\u2019t work out with this group.\u201d Sense of pride doesn\u2019t necessarily lead you to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">angry with people for not giving you what you think you deserve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. Maybe someone who already has a job and is looking for jobs while they already have a job might not feel angry, because they\u2019re more secure. But someone who\u2019s looking for jobs after two years of not working full-time, may feel kind of scared and anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: Like you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: We have to think about why that leads to anger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Actually when I get angry, I just feel judged and compared to and from lack of\u2026and deny everywhere. I guess I take it more personally than I should.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: It can get very personal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Very, very personal. You said like they\u2019re attacking you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: And they\u2019re telling you, \u201cYou\u2019re shit. You\u2019re application\u2019s shit and we don\u2019t want you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: [laughs] [inaudible 00:30:12] [pause] I guess it\u2019s also something that I\u2019m proud of. I mean I take pride in and not getting my due I feel. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not getting my due and yeah. \u201cDon\u2019t invite me for an interview.\u201d [laughs] [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">[inaudible 00:31:26] to be aware and as I get more rejections, which I felt certainly you will, I\u2019m trying to make sure\u2026keeps me aware of it. Getting angry or hasn\u2019t rationalized it. I keep telling myself I have other things that I can be proud of. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Well that\u2019s just it. Somehow that it just is such a blow to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. [pause] Yeah. I think it\u2019s mostly that I think this is something I can do really well and they don\u2019t think so. And I take that as a blow and like I take that very personally and I just have to learn to detach myself from it and kind of realize that I don\u2019t know what they need. They might <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">have put an ad out, but maybe it wasn\u2019t as well written. Maybe I meant something and that\u2026you know? I mean there really are candidates. Maybe it\u2019s fine. Maybe they want to hire someone they know, you know? So what. [inaudible 00:33:08] impasses [inaudible 00:33:13].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I mean they may\u2026I mean there\u2019s eight million reasons why companies don\u2019t hire particular people than others. They may want someone who has continued work experience in the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: They maybe learned either that you couldn\u2019t get a job or what\u2019s the truth is, is you didn\u2019t want a job because you were doing other things. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to hire someone ideally who\u2019s going to work for them for a year and leave and do the things they\u2019d rather do. They\u2019d rather <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">hire someone who wants a career in this field, which you don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562634\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">THERAPIST: And those needs are different. It has nothing to do about what you can and can\u2019t do. It\u2019s not a performance. It\u2019s about their needs and their interests in having someone who wants to do this job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. [inaudible 00:34:17] think about it that way. [laughs] [pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m making sort of very direct, strong statements about this because I do think this is a problem for you. It creates a dynamic for you, where you see people very hostilely. And you see them as hostile to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">Then you feel hostile toward them and I think it\u2019s really not healthy for you. I think it doesn\u2019t make you feel safe or comfortable. I mean it makes you feel angry and resentful and I don\u2019t think you need those feelings. I mean we all have them at times, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I think you could have space for other feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I\u2019m like really mad at them for other things, but things like this and I guess I\u2019m realizing now that this is [inaudible 00:35:58] where I feel like I\u2019m being denied something I was entitled <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">to or whatever, you know. Whereas, it\u2019s like irrational kind of thinking on everyone\u2019s part [inaudible 00:36:12] or just other things going on.

But I\u2019m just wondering like how and what scenario like do I act this way because are there other areas where I\u2019m more blas\u00e9, more Zen about accepting things that don\u2019t come my way? And if so, maybe I can bring that thing of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">Zen out into other areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">THERAPIST: That sounds [inaudible 00:38:30].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">CLIENT: [laughs] Like I guess what I was trying to say earlier, like I don\u2019t care that [inaudible 00:38:40] doesn\u2019t care or doesn\u2019t seem to me to care or doesn\u2019t care in the way that I understand care. I feel like I\u2019m okay with that just the way that I rationalize it. I rationalize it or I have other <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF1\">people in my life who care the way that I want them to care, and that makes it okay that he doesn\u2019t care. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">And the sex thing to me like I mean at least I\u2019m wanting to say I\u2019m not like\u2026I\u2019m not like [inaudible 00:39:15], \u201cGet the fuck outta my house.\u201d You know, [inaudible 00:39:17] be\u2026she\u2019s not going to satisfy me in bed.\u201d I\u2019m just [inaudible 00:39:22] or Graham.

We were watching this movie in which this guy is like addicted to porn and he [inaudible 00:40:05] that and work for every day.

You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: I thought he can, but it\u2019s hard for him to maintain. He can\u2019t get one at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Well depends. Like when he\u2019s not feeling sexual, I guess he probably can then\u2026if he does, it lasts very short. I\u2019m just curious. [laughs] his sexuality [inaudible 00:41:06] think about it. [pause] Yes. And another thing that I don\u2019t get and it\u2019s like, it\u2019s [inaudible 00:41:32] really do it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB1\">but I\u2019m attracted to him for whatever reason and I met Terry, but I\u2019m not attracted\u2026[laughs] I guess that happens.

The truth is no one owes you anything [inaudible 00:43:02]\u201d I don\u2019t know what she meant by that. Maybe she picked up on like my sense of when [inaudible 00:43:16]. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E31\">I\u2019m trying to understand why or how like [inaudible 00:43:19] a doctor.

I cannot just throw out, cover all her bases and make sure everything she thinks maybe wrong with me just to judge me and make me feel really small [inaudible 00:43:58]. She was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">like just in attack mode, but I know that you\u2019re not in attack mode.

[ laughs] Okay. [pause] [inaudible 00:45:01]. They don\u2019t understand. Like I don\u2019t feel entitled to sex. I don\u2019t feel entitled to caring. Maybe that\u2019s just the dynamic of dating. You don\u2019t allow yourself to go there. So I\u2019m just trying to take that knowledge and bring it here. Why do I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">feel entitled to a job?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562634\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s the counterpoint to what I was thinking of when you were taking about sort of this feeling entitled bad. And my thought that I didn\u2019t share is maybe feeling entitle to some things isn\u2019t bad. Like should you be entitled to feel cared for? Should you feel entitled to be respected? Some <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF1\">things to feel entitled for maybe aren\u2019t bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: Oh. [laughs] Just like the opposite. Like I should feel entitled to be cared for and have sex with, but not feel entitled for a job, a total stranger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">CLIENT: [Laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">THERAPIST: It speaks in part to the context of the relationship. It made me think about how that woman from long ago, who didn\u2019t do the interview that you wanted her to do, when she was supposed to write it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: And feeling very angry at her and how you tend to feel entitled to get things from people you don\u2019t know very well. As if there\u2019s sort of this implicit obligation between you and another person whom you really don\u2019t have a relationship with or maybe not much of one versus people that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB1\">actually are in very close contact with, with people by definition of being in a relationship have obligations to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">I mean, we\u2019re in a particular kind of relationship. I have an obligation to be here almost always and be present and be\u2026And if I didn\u2019t give you that, if I didn\u2019t show up sometimes, if I seemed distracted or whatever, you are entitled to those things from me, because we\u2019re in that kind of relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I see that. But I really don\u2019t want to like feel entitled to things in a relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: Because?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I have the knack to kind of demand what I want. Maybe I have been very demanding and it went badly and I hated that person that I became when I was demanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">THERAPIST: Or maybe it\u2019s now safe for you to demand things from people you don\u2019t know very well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s something to talk about for sure. Well we need to stop, but I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Right? At 10 o\u2019clock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: Ten?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: At ten.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: Sorry I didn\u2019t respond. I thought I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t worry. I figured you also\u2026well you said the morning anyway. I figured that, that would work for you. So I have you down for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. I will actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">THERAPIST: Okay. So I have you down for 10.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: Have a good day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20119\">THERAPIST: Thank you very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2011B\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
