And then the minute that was done, usually the months of June and July on to August we have been busy almost every weekend <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">with friends or going somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(Pause): [00:06:20 00:06:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: I've been trying not to over analyze that too much just because it's making me feel a little, I won't say angry, but a little resentment towards him because he put a lot of stuff on me and when I look back at it, it's like well he's just as much at fault here as I am, I feel. And I'm not denying <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">that. I had a strong role to play in his decisions but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">(Pause): [00:07:27 00:08:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: I always felt that he would think about these things that in theory seem perfectly fine and a great idea and then in reality realize, 'oh, that's not the case, like, multiple times he would say, you know we he misses D.C., we should eventually maybe move back to D.C. because of the tight community <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">of friends there and then, you know, times we would go visit these friends, you know, he would comment how he always forgot how they could be sometimes and how miserable it actually could be living there with them, but he constantly would forget that and go in circles and I think that's one of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B2\">things that might have spurred my frustrations. You know, going into certain situations is he would only look at one side of something. You know either realize that there's a not so pleasant side to it or that in reality it just isn't practical.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559592\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">(Pause): [00:09:35 [00:12:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: You're (unclear) today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: My mind is just a little blank.

The thought had crossed my mind until <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">he mentioned it. We were talking about his home relationship problems and he's always having trouble finding somebody and you know, it turned out someone who turned him down actually lied to him, telling him that they were with someone else so that they were interested in someone else when they seemed <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">to have a history of just playing games with people like that. And you know, I was putting myself in his position, saying I would be just as upset as you if I found out someone lied to me like that, or played that sort of game with me and he thought I was talking about my situation with Liam and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200493\">know, mentioned that he wouldn't divulge anything between that either of us said to him to the other and it sort of sparked a thought in my head of, 'well gee, what do you mean by that?' And I, in the context of his conversation, what do you mean by that? And I didn't ask him because I he's a mutual <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200494\">friend and he's been a good friend of mine quite a while now and I didn't want to put him in that awkward of a situation and honestly did not want to know what he could have meant, but I just clarified that I was putting myself in his situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">(Pause): [00:16:55 00:17:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: So he misunderstood what you were referring to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, he thought I was talking about if I found out that Liam lied to me or had something else going on that sparked a breakup, when in actuality I was putting myself in this friend's place saying I would feel the same way he does if I was in his place. That you would look up to somebody and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">it turns out they're just playing a game with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">(Pause): [00:17:33 00:17:43]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: But for a moment I had questioned myself, whether, you know, whether Liam could have done something like that and I eventually dismissed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">(Pause);  00:18:07]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: It's a thought that never really crossed my mind because I couldn't see him doing that and you know, that's why I quickly dismissed it because somebody puts it in your head and you think about it for a moment and then you know, you sort of snap back into reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">(Pause): [00:18:28 00:19:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: It's still a bit awkward though because a lot of our friends who aren't local don't really know as far as I know, they don't really know unless things have leaked through the grapevine, as they tend to do it's not like we went out and made some huge announcement. And I think the way we agreed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">is people find out as they find out. But it's just it's still weird when you talk to someone like a friend I have, a friend who lives up in Maine, I haven't heard from in a couple of years, actually sent me a message last night and we started talking and I had mentioned, 'oh yeah, by the way -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559592\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">(Pause): [00:20:21 00:20:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You know, I quickly glanced at your e-mail you had sent it to me I think just an hour ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: So. Yeah, I quickly glanced at it. Was it easier to e-mail me than talk about it? Or you just wanted to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: I don't know. I just wanted to, yeah, get it out there 'cause you had mentioned to e-mail you and I completely, I spaced on it until late last night and yeah, I think when I ran the numbers, I think what I said, sixty that came to 240 or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: I think that's I hadn't really opened it up, I mean, I saw that you e-mailed me and I went to go get you, so was that what it was 60?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: That's what I'd mentioned. Yeah, 60 which comes to 240. That would be best we could plan it month by month depending on if I'm able to find a new, slightly better paying job. Before (unclear) I'd mentioned I'd hoped to have something before the end of this summer and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I understand you can't control these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Let me think. I think I would be okay with 70. Sixty is a little bit low. I think I could do 70, though. Is that something that you would be able to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean that's only an extra -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Forty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Forty, yeah.

I'm just still a little nervous like I trust myself because I recognize and acknowledge my own limitations. Like I would never intentionally put myself into a situation especially driving, where I know this potential for something, but I still fear <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">driving alone that I could still somehow find myself in a situation where I'm either in an area I have no clue where I'm at and I can't quite navigate my way out of it because I can't see street signs as far ahead as some people can. (Pause) I fear not having, even though I've never depended on that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB2\">second set of eyes in the car, I have this fear of not having that second set of eyes and getting into some sort of accident or hitting something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">(Pause): [00:29:36 00:29:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: If you have that second set of eyes it's almost like a nice safety net someone to say, 'oh, hey, watch out.'

I lot of it is just clothes and books. I offered him my bicycle because I don't ride it around the city that much so, he's going to take that, too. But that's whenever the main thing is it's clothes and books. Because every time he comes to get something he <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB1\">only has a couple of bags or a backpack. So I kind of just need him to drive down with his father's car or grab a Zipcar and drive down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">(Pause): [00:32:58 00:33:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Part of me feels the weird obligation that, well, gee you know, it's his condo, too, and he's still paying but at the same time it's like, well, he's not living there and I'm trying to move on and so I kind of shouldn't be obligated to have to keep looking at all his stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">(Pause): [00:33:52 00:34:02]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: At the same time I don't want to come across as, 'hey, you gave stuff out.'

Do you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: I'm not sure yet. And it's a bit of a big fear right now. We discussed that we're going to revisit that situation in October because a condo trust requires you to be there for a year if you're going before you rent, if you decide to rent. So October would be when we could do that. And that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">option one. But I would have to go and rent elsewhere and renting in the city is not easy or cheap. We could sell it but that would cost us much more money than renting it and me having to go rent something just because we've only had to be here and we wouldn't have we wouldn't be able to recoup any <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E92\">lost costs in closing and whatnot. And then the other option is that I could slowly try to take the burden off of him but that depends on my own job situation and I've got student loans coming up in January. So it's sort of a scary thought and something I'm trying not to think of right now just because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E93\">I have no clue. All of the options would require some money to be pulled out of somewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: When you said, 'I try not to think about it,' it made me think about my asking you about feeling sad about you and Liam breaking up and you're saying you're trying not to think about it because it might be sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: This I try not to think about because it's a scary situation if I, you know, there's a few options and all of those options are straightforward so no matter how much I think about all of those options, there is really this that's it it's one of those options is going to have to be what happens <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED1\">and not knowing those unknowns regarding finances and what will be going on in my life in October, you know? It's a few months down the road, so the only thing I can try and do is prepare for it and keep my finances in a bit of a secure place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: What feels scary about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: The financial strain. You know, if I go to rent someplace, it's going to be a few thousand dollar offset at the beginning because of the deposits and security and whatnot. And then getting somebody to rent this place which I don't think we'd have a problem with getting someone to rent for what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">we would need just because of the location and amenities. But then the fear that if there's a period of what if there is nobody renting it? Would we be prepared to cover those costs ourselves in addition to have our own individual living expenses? So that's my fears are primarily financial with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F12\">regard to the condo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Will you have enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: You know, we purchased the place with enough of a comfort level that if either one of us was ever unemployed, the mortgage could be covered on one's salary and things would be tight, but you know, not Ramen noodle tight. And you know, right now I could, if I didn't have my student loan payments <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F51\">coming up, I could potentially, you know, if I found a job with even a slightly better salary, I could probably make it on my own. But with those loans coming up it throws a bit of a wrench into things and creates a lot of unknown fears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">(Pause): [00:40:41 00:41:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: That's the whole that's one of my feelings surrounding all of this is you plan certain things with safety nets and suddenly those nets are just pulled out from under you and times are a bit more stable now, but still uneasy and there are still a lot of fears out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559592\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">(Pause): [00:41:27 00:41:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: The fear of what will happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: (Pause) Pretty much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">(Pause): [00:41:49 00:42:06]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: And part of me is also stubborn and doesn't want to move out of the condo, but it's you know, that's not driving my choices because I know that's a not a practical reaction to have.

I like it and it sort of overshadows some of those fears and after renting in the city for so many years, I really, I do not want to go back to renting in the city. New York is a horrible city to rent in. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D1\">that's the thing. If I end up renting, I'm going to be spending pretty much my entire savings to move into a place and then paying almost as much as a mortgage for a place that's not quite as nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: And it's not your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop for today, okay?
