data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: [laughs] I'm just...I don't know where to start. [laughs] I think of something, and then think of something else, and then think of something else, so, yeah. (inaudible at 00:10:21) [laughs] (inaudible at 00:10:23)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">Some days, I feel like I need a prompt. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: [sighs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: [laughs] I'm just thinking about stuff from this weekend (ph). [I met] (ph) I guess a friend for dinner. She came to MSU couple years after me. She's also from Nepal and...so (ph) I felt we're very different and all, so I just felt like I'm meeting-we meet once a year or something, I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\"> I've only known her for a little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">But it just seems like she's sniffing me out or something. [laughs] Like, \"What are you up to? What are you working on? How close are you to being done?\" (inaudible at 00:12:17) She puts me on the edge, so I'm trying to...understand what happens there. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Just...the way she asks. Then I was telling Alissa (ph) it's okay if I publish with a small press, at least that will just give me a chance to teach, give me a steady job. That's something I said, but then I say it to-I've said this to many people, and mostly their response is, \"No, no.  You <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">can publish with a big publisher and you'll be successful.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">But she's like, \"Yeah, you know, you can publish small press and get that job, which is what you want.\" [laughs] In that way. It's not exactly condescending, but it minimizes my ambitions. I said that to her, in a sense in a back-up plan sense but she's like, \"That's your plan.\" [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">Mostly she talks about what she does. That also puts me on-edge. I take things very personally. If you tell me you don't like something that I really like, and it's just some artist or some book nothing to do with me I want to know why, and I want to defend it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">That puts me on-edge. Sometimes I think, \"When is this going to end?\" [laughs] \"I just want to go home.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">In those situations, when I feel scared and alone and small, I feel like my best strategy to feel less small is walk away or say no to something. [laughs] But (inaudible at 00:14:42) make an offer, first. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">I think not continuing to spend time with her, that was good. She bought a bottle of wine and then handed it to me, just because she had a longer walk home. [laughs]  Finally, she asked, \"Do you even like white wine?\" I was like, \"No!\" She was like, \"Oh, good.\" Oh, not, I mean, like, \"Oh, I guess than <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">I'll take it back.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">Just saying \"no\" felt good. \"No, I don't want [laughs] your wine. I have to go and meet some friends now, so let's call it a night.\" [laughs] I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">I envision forming this community of artists that are like-minded. It's hard to get over personalities. I just get stuck with petty stuff like personality. Maybe it's not so petty. That's what gets in the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">I have this thing about if the other person is not paying attention, not looking me in the eyes, and cuddling me or something [laughs] like coddling me metaphorically or even literally then it's like they're not interested. They don't like me. [laughs] That's very big for me and I wish I could disabuse <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200571\">myself of that. I feel like that's just (ph) such a sign of insecurity or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560836\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: How am I going to learn this lesson that if people are not paying attention to me, that does not mean that they don't like me or they don't want to spend time with me? [laughs]  That they just have other things on their mind and that's okay. [laughs] I could have other things on my mind, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">I guess that's different. I do see that. It's not like if I'm meeting a friend for dinner and they're talking about things and not asking about me, I'm fine with that. But I guess I'm not fine with-it's not like everyone, it's just on certain occasions when I want attention from someone and then (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">they don't give it to me, then I feel neglected and ignored, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">Nelson (sp?) says the best thing you could do then is to give attention, then you'll get attention. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's sometimes true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, [I'm trying it out] (ph) only sometimes. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah, sure. Whatever (inaudible at 00:18:22) you give attention to will give you attention in return.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What did you want from this woman?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: I don't know. [laughs] I guess I wanted this amazing conversation about literature, about how we're struggling, about her be like, \"Oh, you know, these rejections I'm getting, they put me down.\"  Or, \"Oh, we love this thing so much, it's so great.\" Something like that, I guess. I don't know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">I guess I do have this...ideal, all these ideals in my head, and then when-and reality is never, ever [laughs] like your ideals. Then I end up getting disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">It's not just about my disappointment. It was more about...yeah, just the way she is. She does put me on-edge. She's not warm-overtly warm or warm the way that I expect people to be warm. I mean, I still like her and I'll still meet her, but maybe not right away. [laughs]  I'll think about it very carefully <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F1\">next time, and think about how exactly I'm going to take care of myself if I feel judged or feel vulnerable by something she says, how am I going to avoid feeling low. [laughs] It can't just be that I drink [laughs] before I get there or drink while we're talking. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: I mean, she's just more stable, so she's married. She eats healthy food and cooks for her husband. [laughs] They have a bit of money, they have a house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">Yeah, and she's not breaking down because of all the rejections.  She's taking everything [she said] (ph) down and revising it again and she has plans and she's hopeful and upbeat. I kind of really hate her for that. [laughs] I'm like, \"Wait, that just destroyed me two years ago. Why are you doing okay?\" [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: [sighs] That was just (ph) one thing. Another was I don't know, was it Sunday morning? Yeah, yesterday just looking on Facebook and another friend, her work is coming out and so she was posting about that and an event of her talking about her work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">The thing with that that bothered me was she was talking in this place in India that that woman frequents, the one whose father and I had [this thing] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560836\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">They're both India elite. Yeah, they're India elites. [laughs] They have their connections. One girl's father is a poet; another girl's father is the director of the national (ph) museum and all that. [laughs] I mean, it's ridiculous for me to even think about it yeah, you (ph) spend any amount of <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">time thinking about them and their connections, but it's just that the way that you come close to each other at a school setting, that reduces social boundaries.  Then, when they're back in their own social (ph) positions, those boundaries crop up again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">But I don't know; it just made me feel really weird that they're India elites. [laughs] It makes me feel vulnerable again. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">Yeah, that's the thing, I felt completely at bay and lost at sea for a bit. So I went to see Chris (sp?) last night. [laughs] It feels like such a vacation, a nice vacation, seeing him and being at his place.  It was my place, too. It has all my books, my jewelry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Still?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Eh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Still?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: You (inaudible at 00:24:11) leave it there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, because when I found this room, I just took the basics, like my desk, some books, and moved myself. [laughs] Yeah, most of my books are still at his place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, it's funny how I pushed Chris away, for whatever reason because I was unhappy.  Not only that, but...and now I'm wondering if he's actually a source of strength.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">I mean, he always was, even when I was unhappy (inaudible at 00:25:13). I guess we talked about how he gives me structure and he's supportive, and living with him, I didn't have to worry about money at least, pay my share of rent, I didn't have to do that. I felt taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">But I felt I had an independence and I wanted some craziness [laughs] that (ph) he couldn't give me, and so that was...that's why I always sought out other men (inaudible at 00:25:54).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">Yeah, this weekend was part of, I don't know, [we were] (ph) busy and-I mean, we talk, obviously. He's supportive in his own way, when he's being serious. [laughs] But I still felt lost and scared because of, I guess, these two other women and trying to find my bearings but then...I guess one of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">points on my compass was Chris. [laughs] Maybe is a North Star. [laughs] Maybe, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">I mean, I don't want to say that on the record, but in the sense that I want myself to be my North Star.  I don't want anybody else to be my North Star.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">But he does know me in a way that no one else does, so it's like we had a-(inaudible at 00:27:20) tells me some people from the community used to gather once a month to read stuff that they've been reading and I mostly read what I've been writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">That also didn't go so well. It was at some person's place, someone I don't really like. [laughs] I was I don't know. I felt uncomfortable reading. And then Chris was there and was like, \"You're so good, (inaudible at 00:27:47),\" so I guess I was drawn to him at that moment, and I wanted to talk to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">him and stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Is it bad to go back and forth between two guys? [laughs] I mean, I don't know if that's the way I should look at it, but it feels like kind of become my support system, but then I'm like, \"Is that bad?

[laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: That seems like the question that you grapple with a lot, how much should you rely on other people and when should you try to use yourself as a pillar?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: And your interactions with others can definitely throw you off-kilter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Don't you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah.

If you get something (ph) enough out of them, then there's enough value in that you can weather the parts of them you don't like.  Maybe not, and maybe you feel like it's too disruptive then, maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It's (inaudible at 00:32:15) to think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: I mean, I think both you take things very personally when people are just distracted or whatever, and then this woman might be competitive and so forth, be relating to through her own insecurities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

[laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: It's like everything is graded on a curve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: But that means that it's similar-yeah, it is. Everyone gets Brownie points. That's not what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: I (inaudible at 00:33:32).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don't understand what you mean, [graded that curve] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: On a curve, it's like when you have a class and 90% is A, regardless. That's not a curve. A curve is your A will be somebody else's B. A curve is relative. A curve is like if there are ten people in the class and everyone gets above 90%, there's still going to be equal distribution.  There <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF1\">are going to be Cs and As and Ds and so forth, because everyone is graded relative to each other...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: ...not based on just their own achievement.

That's what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, on a curve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I know, it's an expression. It actually means that it doesn't matter if people get 97% to 100%, that 97%-I don't know if it actually means that people fail, might be. But that 97% could be a D, because relative to everybody else, you didn't do well, even if you did really well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: Oh, I see. That's what that means, okay. I never (crosstalk at 00:34:46).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: One person's up is another person's down, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: I see. How does that apply to my life or my thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Well, because it's like someone else's success is ultimately your failure. It's like there's not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">THERAPIST: ...oh, wait, you'll get a book deal from somebody else. There aren't two great books that can both get published.  It's like there's one (inaudible at 00:35:04) book that's going to get published and this just knocks you down. Everything is relative and everything is evaluative (ph) and comparative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.

You describe that really frequently. \"Look at what this person did and that person did,\" and it's automatically a reflection on you on what you haven't done or maybe even what you can't do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: I'm so tired of thinking [laughs] that way, it's so damaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: That's great! Doing something differently just because you're exhausted by doing what you're doing, that's fine motivation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: [laughs] (crosstalk at 00:35:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: \"I'm sick of smoking all the time!\" Great!

Wanting to stop smoking because you're sick of going to the corner store? Fine!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">CLIENT: [laughs] Yeah, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">THERAPIST: Cigarettes are expensive. (inaudible at 00:36:16), bought a few packs of cigarettes. I had no idea how much cigarettes were. It was $30 some odd for three packs of cigarettes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: Thirty?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Some-odd-dollars for three packs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: That's a lot.

It's cheaper to smoke hookah, much cheaper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: I'm sure it's cheaper to smoke a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: It's probably cheaper to smoke coke!

Sometimes I feel like I can, but it's just that way. It's just that way. Looking at someone else's success just makes me feel horrible. [laughs] Just awful. I can't even look at-I mean, it's really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry, what were you going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: I was going to say just another example. I thought about this \"Forbes\" magazine (inaudible at 00:37:46) and they're just listing 30 Under 30, all these 30 fabulous people who are 22 or whatever. They're like amazing-better than rocket scientists.  What were you going to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">THERAPIST: It reminds me a little bit of our conversation a long ago not that long ago about being something by association, being chosen...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">THERAPIST: ...by association. It's not quite the same thing, but when you hear someone who does something great, you don't think, \"Oh, that could be me!\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">CLIENT: [laughs] Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">THERAPIST: Like, \"Oh, that's inspiration! She could do it, I can do it!\" It's, \"Ugh, what haven't I done? What can't I do?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">THERAPIST: It doesn't give you hope. Like, \"Oh, look, that's possible!\" I mean, you could say if you're surrounded by people who have no success, you could feel like, \"Oh, God, I guess no one's doing well. How is that even possible, to do well?\" Whereas when you're around people who do well, it's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201491\">\"Oh, look, this is possible. This is possible for me, too.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I mean, there is a certain way that media and everything does project these success stories as in, \"Na na na na na na,\" in your face. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2014A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560836\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Or (ph) la-la-la.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: [laughs] I feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: I know you feel that way. Because you feel someone else's success is almost an implicit sort of condescension or implicitly saying, \"Look what I did that you didn't do.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: I know, and this is at the core of me and it makes me-it creates a lot of problems, a lot of problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: [laughs] It's not just looking at people in the magazine, it's actual people in the room that I could actually get along with and stuff. But as soon as they say, \"Oh, I'm a post-doc, I have a Ph. D.,\" and I just completely freak out. [laughs] Feel horrible and lonely; I just want to run away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">It doesn't make me feel like, \"Ooh, I could do that! If she can do it, I can do it.\" No, [laughs] not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">I mean, I'm sure it stems from all the negative and condescending things my dad said to me growing up, but I feel like it's time I disabused myself of that kind of thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about him and just his bitterness, too. He's so bitter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah, very bitter. And he was someone who had early success in life; he went into the best college. He was decent-looking and he was a boxer, so in every area he was-and he got a job right away.  But (inaudible at 00:41:03), for whatever reason... [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: Which I guess shows you that it's far more a reflection of something that was inside him than anything that was really a reflection of his achievement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">CLIENT: I don't know. Nelson says money brings him confidence. [laughs] He says the moment he walks into a room, he just thinks that everyone likes him, even if they don't. He just tells himself that. [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">I mean, that's what I'm attracted to (inaudible at 00:42:12) a lot, that is, his confidence and he's always upbeat and personable. [laughs] I guess I want to learn to be that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">That dinner would have gone so much better in my head if I had just said, \"She likes me!\" [laughs] Even if she doesn't, just tell myself, \"She likes me,\" and then maybe the words coming out of my mouth would have been less self-deprecating. [laughs] I wouldn't have told her of my back-up plan, maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B1\">I would have told her of my, ooh, wild ideas of how-my dreams, being successful. [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">I could put your [sic] best foot forward or whatever, instead of not your worst, but half-hearted, awkward attempts [laughs] at dancing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016F\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20171\">CLIENT: He tells me I should be very cocky because-it matters where you come from and what you struggle with, instead of you're only born with...I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20173\">I mean, Chris says that, too.
