I hired someone to help me decorate the office, so I just told her to get whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: So they don\u2019t have any specific significance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Very bold. (pause) I guess I was talking about feeling like an outsider last week. I think last week, like Thursday, I got an e-mail from online, close to me, in India. Not that one whose dad came on to me but the other one whose place I went to after that. So, she and her husband kind of hosted <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">me. They\u2019re [Chris\u2019s?] friends. They were all together at UNC, getting their PhDs in various things. And\u2026 these guys are like really elite, like their families are kind of famous in India and they\u2019re friends with the Gandhis, like the prime minister, like whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Big people. So she sent me an e-mail saying, I just met that woman at a party, and the next day she sent me a Facebook request. Here\u2019s an explanation of why I decided to accept her friend request. (nervous chuckle) Da-da-da, and it\u2019s not an endorsement of who she is or what she did, but I shouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">punish her for what her dad did, and this doesn\u2019t mean like a friendship and I hope you\u2019re doing okay. There have been so many cases of sexual harassment and I\u2019ve been thinking about you and all that. (chuckles) I\u2019m glad you were able to get away. It was sweet of her to think of me, but at that time <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">it just kind of shook me up, you know, that e-mail, like I\u2019m like a political case or whatever, or that I\u2019ll be the girl who got sexually harassed or whatever. [0:07:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">So, yeah, I was really upset that whole day and felt very insecure and was crying and stuff. I didn\u2019t really know what to reply to her, what to say to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Were you upset that she accepted the friend request or what was upsetting you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: No, I was just not really thinking, just feeling, and I was feeling like an outsider. I was feeling like these are powerful people, both of them come from big families or whatnot, and you know, they\u2019re the deadly elite. So, I have no place there and I felt left out and ganged up on. (chuckles <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">nervously) Not really ganged up on but you know what I mean, just feeling that way, feeling small, because of an alliance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">Then I saw her and like those two women, and then my friend in India, who has published her novel, it was like the holy trinity, you know? These three women, you\u2019d better stay away from them, or they\u2019re not my they\u2019re dangerous and powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s what I was thinking, that you went from being an outsider, being separate, to being in danger or against. I\u2019m not sure I understand that transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Well, I guess the sense of danger came from what her dad did. So, yeah. I know I had an agency and stuff, that I can take myself out of the situation and not be a helpless little baby or a little girl that can\u2019t defend herself, but that\u2019s what it was when I was there. Not that I\u2019ve become little, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200391\">but I had that whole matter of I have no one and I need help, and I\u2019m seeking their help. That kind of really put me in that position of not being able to defend myself or draw the line too much or too decisively. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20038-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20038-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561396\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">So, that\u2019s it felt that way but then it kind of, you know, for a few hours, then I kind of said okay, time to let it go. I mean, I\u2019m not entirely disabuse myself of that feeling, and I still feel threatened and left out and slighted, and like an outsider, but I guess I\u2019m kind of ignoring that for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">a bit and just like (sighs) just focusing on my work and things like bring me peace, like reading, watching TV or whatever.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Yeah, because there was a lot to think about after that, and I cannot retaliate in the sense that, I think okay, they have community, they have powerful fathers or famous fathers, and how can I recreate that and feel powerful myself? Well, I tried to create a community, I was very proud of the community <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">I had here, and then there were a couple differences, and then I just kind of lost interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry, I lost that, there are a couple of differences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Well, like I had a fight with that girl at that Thanksgiving party.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: And then this other girl, who didn\u2019t invite me to her birthday and I felt very left out, because everyone was there, everyone from the (inaudible) group was there and like, yeah. We had our meeting yesterday and I didn\u2019t go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Why not? You didn\u2019t want to see them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, I really didn\u2019t want to see them and I don\u2019t know, I guess maybe stuff that [Nelson?] has been saying is kind of taking is going somewhere here, having some effect. I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s like, you don\u2019t really you shouldn\u2019t go there, they rile you up and all they do is sit and talk about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">how bad the world is, you need friends. I\u2019m like, yeah that is so true. Instead, I spent most of the day with a friend, went to the mall. I mean I do this, like I wanted to work yesterday but I put that aside just to hang out with her, and then she\u2019s upset, she\u2019s crying, so I thought maybe this could <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">be a good chance to be there for her and build this friendship. So, we just did fun stuff yesterday and then I went to this dinner party with Nelson. I wasn\u2019t like I was observing myself. I guess like after the fact, I was thinking hey, I wasn\u2019t feeling very insecure when I shook hands with people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200493\">who have PhDs in robotics and are doctors. You know? I was just fine actually and people were asking about my book and they were connecting it to their own grandparents experience, because I\u2019m writing something a little bit historical. So, you know, I was like, how much more can I ask for, like strangers\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200494\">And it\u2019s funny, because one person had almost the exact same last name as me, just one alphabet different. So it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s like I haven\u2019t really thought about him. It\u2019s like yeah, shouldn\u2019t I be really thankful for this kind of a connection? It\u2019s not as intensely emotional, because they\u2019re not making <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200495\">me feel small or whatever, it\u2019s just level, and there is not as much drama when things are level. But it\u2019s still, you know, it\u2019s good I guess. I don\u2019t know, I was just I guess I am surprised that I wasn\u2019t feeling small, shaking hands with people who I think have it all and have it together. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200496\">fine until that woman walked in, the one I had a fight with at Thanksgiving. She was sitting way over there and I was sitting at the other end, and I just wanted her to be not looking at me. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561396\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">Yeah, I guess what I\u2019m really trying to say, so yeah, I mean I used to think that okay, what makes them powerful is the fact that they have a community. People in my community are all about yeah, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the world right now, we\u2019ve lost our communities. So, I\u2019m like yeah, I should hang <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">out with you guys, but then all we do when we hang out is talk about what\u2019s wrong with the world. It\u2019s true, especially that\u2019s important. People are like you can\u2019t have you know, that\u2019s how you build power, by understanding things, but I\u2019m like, I\u2019m a little more emotional. You guys all have your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B2\">friends and then you come and talk about politics. I come here and expect to find friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t think they do too? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Some of them. Maybe they do, but not everyone gets along with them. The reason I didn\u2019t go last night was like yeah, I didn\u2019t want to see some of these people, but also that I joined the group to make friends and a couple people have kind of their actions shown me that we cannot be friends, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">so maybe a couple others. There\u2019s one girl I get along with and we sometimes kind of rarely\u2026 She\u2019s a lot more open minded, so I guess I have one friend there. I just don\u2019t feel like doing more reading about patriarchy and talking about it. I would much rather have a drink and just not do anything, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F2\">even watch TV. Yeah. So I don\u2019t know if community is the thing that will bring me strength. I was pretty sure that it was but then it\u2019s like what do you do when people act weird or you act weird and then they act weird and you know. I totally feel like running away, the bitterness that develops instantly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F3\">in me, makes me want to run away, so what do I do about that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: What do you think the bitterness is about? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Being left out, being forgotten, being abandoned. I was really mad at this third woman. We hung out one time and it was nice, and I thought she felt the same way, and then the semester was ending and I was like even before the semester was ending, I wrote her and said, I had a good time. We <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">talked about hanging out as soon as we both got free, so here\u2019s the times I\u2019m free, let me know. And then several days later she\u2019s like oh, hi, I\u2019m sorry I missed whatever, and happy new year, and I was just like, you know, fuck you. What the hell, you know? I put so much effort and I have so many expectations <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200532\">and they just kind of you have so many other friends, I get it. And then when I saw her, she\u2019s very sweet, she\u2019s just busy. I saw her at a gathering and was just like so mad at her. I didn\u2019t even want to look at her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: What did she do to you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, she, you know, she didn\u2019t respond. We talked about how we were going to hang out as soon as we were free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s free so soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah, but she said that she would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Maybe she miscalculated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: (laughs) I know, but it feels like a really giant kind of betrayal.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561396\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yes, it does. You very much feel like the world aggresses against you. I mean, an outsider is someone no one cares about essentially, right? No one cares about an outsider. You don\u2019t feel like that you feel like people are specifically targeting you, hostile towards you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s a problem. No?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so, and what Chris says makes it worse. When people don\u2019t really care about you, they\u2019re not really thinking about you, they\u2019re busy and involved, which is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Why does it make it worse? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Because it\u2019s worse, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of, that people aren\u2019t thinking about me and wanting to hang out with me, and it confirms my fears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Is it easier to think that they\u2019re aggressing against you, upon you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Some emotion is better than no emotion. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I mean, I was feeling all this very intensely and then it kind of mellowed and I was nice to her and I did tell her oh, I\u2019m hanging out with this friend at that time, if you\u2019re free you should come. I did try hard to get over <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">my bitterness and she didn\u2019t come. I mean, I don\u2019t know, I feel like maybe I should just find it in myself to take care of myself and not reach out so much, and let people reach out to me. (pause) I feel like that is my problem, reaching out is my problem. When I reach out, I have expectations and all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F2\">that. I\u2019m trying to fight against my nature and just be chill, you know? Because I didn\u2019t write to this friend, the one I hung out with yesterday, I didn\u2019t write to her all throughout the break and all throughout the semester actually. She\u2019s at school with me and she was the one who reached out. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F3\">was like, do you want to hang out? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s not really the expectations. The expectations, you feel obligate people to you, so it\u2019s not that you feel disappointed, you feel angry. You expect this and why aren\u2019t they living up to their end of the bargain, as if they\u2019ve entered this bargain with you, and then you feel angry at them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s like I said, I\u2019m trying to change that, not hold them to anything. I don\u2019t know how to do it but I just think that maybe if I don\u2019t reach out and let them reach out, and try to really just focus on myself, like really intensely focus on myself. Instead of needing people to do stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">with me, I\u2019ll just do stuff with myself, you know, and as far as meeting new people, goes like I won\u2019t really reach out to them unless and until they reach out to me, and then I\u2019ll accept their invitation if I can. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. (nervous chuckle) I think we talked about this last week, like the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200732\">whole obligation thing is me just jumping the gun and being really impatient and thinking oh, I can be I can get a best friend right now, in one month, just by binding them into an agreement and getting to know them really quickly, like the crash course of getting a best friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Get rich quick. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Get rich quick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yes.

This friend, he also calls, but I guess there is no sex. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B1\">know, I just yeah.

I think of this woman\u2019s e-mail and stuff, I was like why are you only talking about that? I didn\u2019t address that all when I replied to her. I was just like hey, no it\u2019s okay, nothing is horrible, and by the way, here <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">are photos of your kids I took this summer. I didn\u2019t really address anything she said. I hope she\u2019s not mad. I don\u2019t know, she hasn\u2019t replied. Like instead of being, remember our yeah, remembered for anything I had said or done, I was remembered for what had happened to me when I was there. That was upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t have to tell anybody. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Huh?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: You didn\u2019t have to tell anybody. She only knew because you told her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Well, that\u2019s I\u2019m just saying, that\u2019s what she\u2019s responding to. You\u2019re saying oh, you don\u2019t want her to just think of that when she thinks of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: But you communicated that.

You see yourself very much as other people see you, a particular way, and I guess what I\u2019m trying to draw your attention to is that you contribute and create those circumstances. It\u2019s not just simply that people are imposing these views on you. There\u2019s conflict in your community when <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">you create it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019re saying oh, but this community is, you know, there\u2019s conflict.

Then don\u2019t portray yourself that way and she won\u2019t see you that way. Problem solved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: Well, I didn\u2019t, did I? When I replied to her e-mail all I said was here\u2019s photos of your kids and yes, I\u2019m busy writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re absolutely right, you\u2019re absolutely right, that\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t address anything about the summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">THERAPIST: And it very well may be that you know, how she thinks about that and you just will shift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (pause) So maybe the trick with these women in the community is to like not refer to the incident at Thanksgiving, or the fact that I wasn\u2019t invited to a birthday party, but to shift focus to something else. But for that, I have to see them or interact with them and you know. (nervous <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D11\">chuckle) And somewhat get over my bitterness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: I mean it did. For the summer, I kept thinking that the whole narrative is like I worked on my book and while I was taking (sighs) favor from someone, I was I was what was the word I wanted to use? Like, this old man came up to me, and I was put in a difficult and uncomfortable situation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D51\">But then, that kind of changed to like, I was put in this whole situation, I was sexually harassed, I was molested. It kind of like, went out of my hand. I lost control of that narrative somehow, somewhere, because a lot of people suddenly became involved, because I told so many people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: (laughs) What is that supposed to mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: I mean, yeah, that\u2019s how it I mean you felt victimized and that\u2019s what people picked up on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Not the least of which is you were there to begin with, because you were with Chris, who you wanted not to have time to spend with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: You wanted your own space. You were traveling with your then boyfriend, but you didn\u2019t want to spend time with him. You found another place. It\u2019s not like you had nowhere to go. You just wanted to be away from him. I mean, I know you wanted your own space to write, but it\u2019s he didn\u2019t cast <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E31\">you out, you wanted him to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t say he cast me out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Right, but this whole thing, oh I was just stuck here and I was in the you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">CLIENT: No, I didn\u2019t say I was stuck there, no that\u2019s not what I said. I just said that what I said was just that that\u2019s the price I paid for space, like\u2026 Yeah, I mean it was in my space, it was comfortable and everything, but the fact that it was cheap, I mean that\u2019s why it was it was cheap. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">could have spent all that money at a guest house, that I didn\u2019t spend.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561396\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED\">CLIENT: And since I was taking a favor, I didn\u2019t really feel like being very aggressive when, you know, the man said, oh, poor you, you\u2019re this, you\u2019re that. I didn\u2019t want to say shut up or, you know, like I\u2019m leaving now. I had to like smile and nod and just shrug it off or something. And then when <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED1\">it kind of started escalating, very quickly when he said, \u201cYou crave a man\u2019s touch, don\u2019t you?\u201d You know, I didn\u2019t just say shut up you dirty old fool, you know. I couldn\u2019t, so I was just like, did he really say that? (pause) Yeah, I mean, I definitely feel like I could have handled the situation much <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED2\">better, as soon as he said that, just kind of put distance and really, really avoid being alone with him. I didn\u2019t take care of that, so. Because I didn\u2019t know, like it would go that far. (sighs) And then when it did go that far, I just couldn\u2019t keep it to myself. But then Amt keeps saying it\u2019s good <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED3\">that you didn\u2019t, because now we know who she really is, and she\u2019s a horrible person. But I don\u2019t know, you know, are people horrible or do you just see a horrible side of them sometimes? There\u2019s no point of regretting what already happened, but I mean it is kind of it has become this kind of, it feels <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200ED4\">like a permanent situation, that I feel really threatened and scared about going back to India. And I did kind of use that to kind of push Chris away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not following that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200F1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s not true, but sometimes I feel like when I move out of this place, this cheap suburban, that place, not that apartment but that part of that house. And the circle, which is kind of not a circle of hypocrites, but like full of people who are really very high up and elite <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">and make me feel small.
