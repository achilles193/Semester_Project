(pause) I guess I\u2019m feeling a little stretched because I have all these big experiments, but then there are little things I need to do in between and I feel very unmotivated to do them because I kind of want to focus on what I need to do to kind of get through <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">these larger things.  So I guess I\u2019m just kind of focusing on those [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:27) not really. I\u2019m feeling like I have a lot of things to do, but not really wanting to do them and seeing them as a burden. I feel pretty calm about it.  I\u2019m not very anxious. If something pops up that I need <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">to do, I add it to the list and hope I get to it at some time. (long pause)  I guess in terms of getting myself prepared for moving and planning, like how I should I move my stuff, I guess I also feel very unmotivated. I think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have [ ]. Everything is just on me to decide or make <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">a decision. I just feel very unmotivated or not excited about doing it myself.  I just feel like it\u2019s more work I have to do. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I guess [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:55) focused and getting it done and the stages of it can be isolated and lonely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  It\u2019s just hard to feel motivated or excited about doing some of this by myself. There are a lot more immediate things to be focused on or to do. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know why. I guess I just don\u2019t really have a preference. I just want what\u2019s easiest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: In terms of deciding where I\u2019m going to live or how to move my stuff. I just don\u2019t really want to think about it, so I kind of just want to do what\u2019s easiest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Right. People keep asking me if I have been looking and I just don\u2019t really have the time or feel motivated.  I\u2019m spending my energies doing work and moving is not really at the top of my list to figure out or work on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s as though, in a way, you don\u2019t care much about or discount yourself and what happens to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being lazy and not wanting to do some research or look around. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Maybe this is not exactly what you\u2019re talking about, but I wonder if you also feel like it doesn\u2019t matter to me that you\u2019re leaving. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I haven\u2019t really thought about it. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know. It kind of just seems natural. It\u2019s the nature of it. It\u2019s kind of like at work. People come and go. It just seems natural. I don\u2019t know. It just seems kind of like formal or not . . . I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I think I know what you mean. In a way, it feels like people are already so distant from each other that it doesn\u2019t matter much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Which I guess would be me at work as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  In a way it feels like [I\u2019ve done] (ph?) something wrong or . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019m removing myself from the situation or keeping my distance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I see. (long pause)  Maybe that\u2019s safer?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562432\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right, but it\u2019s also something I want. I want to be more self-reliant and I feel extremely vulnerable or dependent on people. I don\u2019t like that. (pause)  It seems like examples of work or the way people in my position leave or whatever, people always say care more about yourself; worry about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">what you need to do. You\u2019re leaving, so what\u2019s going to happen? You\u2019re not going to get in trouble for not finishing something. For me, I can\u2019t turn that on. It\u2019s not satisfying [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:49).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I see. So you can\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019ve got to spend more time looking for an apartment or whatever when I\u2019m at work. I\u2019m going to blow off this piece of work\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s going to get done three days too late\u201d or something like that, the way that somebody else might be able to do and might be encouraged <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">to do.  But you feel too vulnerable to do that and too reliant on the people you want to maintain a good impression with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Also I think it\u2019s just easier to do things for other people who are more motivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Somehow that seems to matter more? That\u2019s easier to want to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right.  (long pause)  It just seems like other people can advocate for themselves, have beliefs or form arguments, where they can justify what they\u2019re doing. I can never do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: In a way, I guess it\u2019s like you feel more remote from yourself, not from what other people need \u2013 like from your own needs or vulnerability as far as what can happen to you if you don\u2019t do things you need to do for yourself.  Those feel more remote, less important, less motivating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:12) often feel very connected to what other people want or what matters to them or what they need from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I guess I don\u2019t know what to do because seeing what I would call selfishness in other people infuriates me. I don\u2019t know what to do. Maybe it\u2019s easier to be selfish or . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: And it certainly [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:14) it\u2019s very practical. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t [know how to] (ph?) get excited or cultivate that. [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:35)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well you hate it. You find it, I think, repugnant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I guess I don\u2019t have the sense that you find me wholly that way, but maybe in certain aspects that I\u2019m committed. I wonder if, at times, it feels to you like I\u2019m making an excuse on my own behalf and I\u2019m not going to give advice or tell you what I think you should do with the stated reason <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">that I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s helpful, but it certainly gets me off the hook, too.  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean I know what you\u2019re talking about, but I always feel like I\u2019m just not being clear or I\u2019m supposed to be processing or dealing with [it with lack of] (ph?) advice or direction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I see. So you go back and forth on whether you think I can actually help. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)  I guess I can rationalize that I need to work things out or feel things or process my own emotions and not something that I\u2019m telling myself, but then it kind of comes down to what do I do or what do I feel or how do I get out of this? I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m torn. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562432\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I guess it\u2019s also how I\u2019m kind of with you in this and kind of not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Another way to say it is that it feels like I\u2019m kind of motivated in your behalf and kind of not? (long pause) I put it that way because it seems to me like there is something important about how, when you don\u2019t feel like the people around you are really caring or putting themselves aside <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">on your behalf, where they would be there for you in some way with what you need, it\u2019s a lot like you not being able to do that for yourself either.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. Somehow it still feels like my fault that if I was better at explaining myself or I could advocate for myself, but I\u2019m kind of unsure of how to deal with the situation or it\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s hard for me to tell a story or tell what\u2019s going on.  So it\u2019s harder for the other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">person to be supportive. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I see. It\u2019s on you first to be able to explain or express yourself and, if you can\u2019t do that, why would somebody else or how would they know what to do to be helpful [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:06)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: And it feels like there are other things you\u2019re not adequately explaining or not making clear to me or that I don\u2019t get, but that you\u2019re trying to get across? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, it feels like I\u2019m just not explaining everything correctly or I just don\u2019t know what I want or need, so it\u2019s hard to [have a direction or] (ph?) what I want. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like if you\u2019re at an ice cream store and the person behind the counter is preoccupied doing whatever, but you\u2019ve actually told them you want a chocolate shake, then it doesn\u2019t quite feel fair to blame them for not getting you want you want or something?
