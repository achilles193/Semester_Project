They were close for a while <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: He wrote to him about some of the things, not others (inaudible at 00:12:31)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: He didn't meditate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: He didn't. Not as far as I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: You haven't asked him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I have not asked him. He did associate. That was sort of his method for analyzing dreams at that time was the associate to the elements of the dream and then look at the association and the kind of like repeated or kind of aggregate things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: So interesting.

You know, so there's no such thing as self-analysis. I think the self-reflective part is really important and one of the things one develops hopefully over the course of an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: I think you may be thinking about self-analysis today in part because you're pretty exasperated with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: Like, \"Forget this. I'll just do it myself?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">THERAPIST: Something like that maybe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">CLIENT: I was thinking about you and how you relate to your (inaudible at 00:17:15) (PAUSE) I think there is something about being here that like you're (inaudible) it's hard to, it's hard to talk about things that are not happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D\">CLIENT: Like... (PAUSE) I don't know. (PAUSE) Maybe it's like by doing that I'm ignoring too much or you're ignoring too much. (PAUSE) But what's been on my mind are things that are not happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20071\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:18:57)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20073\">THERAPIST: Hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20075\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, it seems to me that's something that's going on both inside and outside the room (PAUSE) that it feels difficult to talk about those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20079\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2007B\">CLIENT: Mm hmm.

(PAUSE) I guess there would be a reason to get out of the room, like a fire or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: So then it wouldn't work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: I guess not. (PAUSE) So the dream was that your father died and then we didn't talk about it. We didn't get to it.

So like everywhere we went was so beautiful even when we're saying goodbye.

I guess what I'm wondering about is whether (PAUSE) you, on the one hand, want to be talking about and focusing on nothing other than what's going on in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200BD1\">the room and between you and me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200BF\">THERAPIST: That would be desired. And, at the same time, maybe it's too consuming or too hot and you also want to be talking about all the other people, things going on in your life. Part for their own sake and part because there's not the same kind of heat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C1\">THERAPIST: And (PAUSE) maybe it seems that you have, if that's anywhere in the right ballpark, sort of (PAUSE) like projected some of this onto me in a particular way. What I have in mind is made me the one who doesn't want to hear anything about what's going on inside this room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C3\">CLIENT: Mm hmm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C5\">THERAPIST: \"We'll put your dad off until tomorrow.\" (PAUSE) \"I don't want to know what happened on your way back from Maine.\" I'm not going to do that sort of... You have to talk at me as if you're trying to get through a barrier of some kind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200C9\">THERAPIST: And so it maybe you're projecting into me the sort of half of your dilemma that's focused on just being interested in what's going on in the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200CB\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200CD\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:37:01)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200CF\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D1\">CLIENT: I was so frustrated yesterday. (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:37:49)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D3\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D5\">CLIENT: And at some point there was an explosion of... Well, it was sort of like a slow trickle at first (inaudible) how Zach (ph), just the two of us at home feels from vacation. I was supportive. I felt... I connected with how many people and stories and just worlds there are to explore when there <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200D51\">are four generations and two dogs and mountains and frogs and turtles and tadpoles. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559873\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">CLIENT: So I felt the weight of the all at once and that led me back to the bedroom and I got it all off my chest and cried a lot and had really difficult time sort of speaking and breathing. And at some point, I felt so frustrated that I like couldn't be sharing this with you also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DD\">CLIENT: Like, one, because it was such an important contrast that hasn't really been so clear in the past and it felt... (PAUSE) It felt like progress or something. And a lot came up about how Jeremy makes it really hard to feel connected and engaged. He sort of doesn't really speak to me that much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF\">CLIENT: He's off in his own world. So there was a lot of nice acknowledgement with that. But the end of the discussion was about how frustrated I am about not being able to bring separation which feels like a central challenge to you, like in a way that has to do with my separating from other people, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200DF1\">not just you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">CLIENT: Because there's stuff like yesterday's painful separation and crying and pain was so pure and clean and (PAUSE) what I want help with.
