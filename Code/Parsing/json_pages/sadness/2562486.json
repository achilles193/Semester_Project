So it\u2019s been a very visiting sort of weekend for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh. Did I mention I was going to be away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: You did then I forgot. When are you going to be away again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: You forgot; I forgot I mentioned it. I\u2019m going to be away Saturday afternoon, a week from Friday. So that\u2019s the 18th and then I will be away Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday that following, which I think is the 21st, 22nd and 23rd. And, that\u2019s right, you mentioned working as usual. Do you want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">me to text it to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll just write it. I\u2019ll write it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: And you mentioned you\u2019re working as usual that following Thursday, which I think is the 24th. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes, so you\u2019re away the 18th through the 24th basically?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: The 18th through the 23rd, although we don\u2019t meet on Thursday. Are you working as usual on the 18th?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Is it Good Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: This coming Sunday is Palm Sunday so Friday after that is Good Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Right, which is the one where -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: So we\u2019re not working but I wouldn\u2019t be able to come in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Okay. Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: We have church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: No that makes sense. I remember [inaudible at 00:01:39].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: But I had to ask because I\u2019m not leaving until later in the day. That\u2019s why I asked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Okay, thanks. If you have any time open in the morning that may be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: All right. I\u2019ll let you know. So it\u2019s been a visiting sort of weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: [Laughs] Thanks. So Geoffrey, my law teacher, is in town, or was in town this weekend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: He was a grad student at Brown and is working at Brown?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yes, he\u2019s super. He\u2019s a very dear person but he sort of has a couple of tracks that he runs on and he just sort of runs on them constantly. And so we basically just have the same conversations every time we meet, which most of the time I really enjoy it but for the last couple of years they\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">been very painful conversations for me. So that was tough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">So we he\u2019s also, he wants to spend all the time talking and he\u2019s very sort of slow moving. So we said let\u2019s have lunch. We\u2019ll meet up on Sunday after church and have lunch and it took four hours. And I hadn\u2019t thought to say oh we have this other thing we have to go to at 2:00 so it was a long time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">And then I lent him a book. I was talking about using a new Hebrew textbook that has come out in the last couple of years. And he wanted to see it so I lent it to him. And he was leaving this morning so I said well I\u2019ll come by and get it from you. And he said we could have breakfast and I said I\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D2\">get back to you on that one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">So I did not have breakfast with him but I came by and we had a cup of tea and then we talked for a while and it was just a lot of the same. And every time he says so if you guys end up staying here do you think you would go back to Brown, and I have to explain why no, no I\u2019m really not going to every <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">single time. And it\u2019s [real painful] (ph). I don\u2019t know. I miss it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">And then at church yesterday there was so usually there\u2019s usually a 6:00 service and then an 8:00 service and usually a sandwich or soup-supper between them. And I\u2019m one of the people that\u2019s supposed to set that up or be in charge of that. And the other person basically I got stuck with that job <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">because nobody else would do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562486\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes, thanks. I didn\u2019t have the strength of will to say no, I won\u2019t be in charge of this. And it\u2019s just more like I think it\u2019s really important that we do it and so if I think it\u2019s important, I\u2019ve got to be willing to make it happen. And Sean who\u2019s the guy who sort of organized, who sort of brought <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">it back and organized it, is, he\u2019s a great guy but he really, he has to talk about something three or four times before he feels comfortable actually doing it. I you know it\u2019s important that we do this but it\u2019s really not a big deal in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">So I got there last night and I was supposed to set up the sandwiches and there weren\u2019t any sandwiches because the place hadn\u2019t delivered them. And so, and then we eventually found them because the catering company had delivered them to a different church building that was three blocks away. And so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">we got those but then Camilla said oh and there\u2019s going to be 20 to 30 heads coming in. So they\u2019re coming for the 8:00 service so can we feed them too? So we ran out to get some pizzas. And it was, there was no world in which any of this was a big deal. The worst-case scenario is people don\u2019t have anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">to eat; it\u2019s going to be okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">I\u2019m rife on that very frame because I could say okay we\u2019ll fix this. Okay, let\u2019s do this. But it was very funny to sort of I was sort of in the mindset of we decide and then we do it and then we\u2019re done. And Sean was very much in the mindset of oh well I\u2019m going to come over and then consult and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">we\u2019ll talk about it some more and then I\u2019m going to get fussy with Camilla about not telling us about these people beforehand. Are we sure this is going to be okay? I don\u2019t think this is going to be okay. I said it\u2019s okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">He sort of really wanted to talk with Camilla and Chuck, the priest, about it and it was 10 minutes before they had to go upstairs and do the service so I said they can\u2019t do this right now. This is not but I don\u2019t know. Plus as an aside I spent most of the evening running around and fixing things <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">and then running around and talking to people. I\u2019m not really talkative, but good. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Because you made stuff happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. It\u2019s good to be faced with a problem and be able to say okay well this is the solution and then we can do it kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I had to question our credit card debt. It\u2019s less easy to see what solution there is. Yes, I get, I just get overwhelmed with the money stuff. We\u2019ve spent 1\/3 of our income last year on therapy and I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s I just get so angry about this situation. I\u2019m so angry that this is where we are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">and it\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s not my fault that I couldn\u2019t work for a few months and that we put a lot of money on credit cards because that\u2019s what they\u2019re for is emergencies. But now we can\u2019t get out of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">It\u2019s really not James\u2019s fault but he\u2019s the one who has to deal with it and I can\u2019t deal with it. Realistically he would be the one who would want to deal with it anyway. That\u2019s how he rolls. But I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562486\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Yes, there\u2019s no, family or article or even [inaudible at 00:10:43] for gratitude. And if you were teaching there would have been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause] I just feel like we\u2019re stuck. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">So after this I\u2019m going to have tea with Joshua, he\u2019s the friend from [] so we\u2019ll see. I haven\u2019t seen him anyway in almost a year. He\u2019s just sort of out of the blue sent me an e-mail [inaudible at 00:14:09] so. Not the worst timing; maybe not the greatest. I don\u2019t know what good timing would be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s your point a bit about the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether I could\u2019ve applied for Disability. I actually, I didn\u2019t look into it mostly because I wasn\u2019t well enough to look into it. I didn\u2019t have the energy to do anything. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: I mean I guess I meant what I said in our meeting [inaudible at 00:15:17] that okay you had started by saying this happened and it wasn\u2019t my fault, both that you couldn\u2019t be earning money and you were having to spend so much on therapy, at least that how I understood what you said. And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">don\u2019t know what I intended to say was something like and yes it would\u2019ve you were in a situation where you didn\u2019t have any of that kind of thinking that had you happened by chance to get another one you would have had a [starting point] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: Yes, no that was my point. I don\u2019t know where to go from there. It\u2019s a lot more painful to think of it as not being my fault than it is to think of it as somehow being my fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">And now I feel like okay now I need to either be spending less or I need to be making more. And I can\u2019t really be spending less; I just can\u2019t be. And I don\u2019t, we\u2019ve already pretty much pared down our budget as low as it gets. We could not buy groceries from local places anymore and spend less on food <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200671\">that way but that would not be that much of a difference. And I can\u2019t be making more until I know where we\u2019re going to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">I feel like it\u2019s my fault and I can\u2019t fix it. I don\u2019t know if I feel like it\u2019s my fault but I definitely feel like it\u2019s mine to fix but I can\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:19:30]?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Like it\u2019s some of your responsibility?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">[Pause] [Crying]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: I guess I wonder how much, why you chose one or need to be taken care of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Sorry, I didn\u2019t hear the first part of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Sure. I guess I\u2019m wondering how much this is upsetting because it\u2019s hard to actually to want or to need to feel taken care of. I\u2019m thinking about both the money and the treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know it\u2019s sort of both. It\u2019s hard for me to say, to continue to say no I need and I deserve to be taken care of, to be treated like that isn\u2019t negotiable. It\u2019s sort of this constant thing that I have to keep fighting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">But I also feel like I\u2019m getting to the point where I can start taking care of myself. I could, I have things to offer but I\u2019m sort of stuck in this place where I can\u2019t, where I\u2019m just dependent on -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I see, because of the situation and not knowing where or when you\u2019re going to move?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yes. And also the things that I\u2019m good at not really being things that people tend to pay for or, yes. Geoffrey would just say why don\u2019t you just go back to teaching? You\u2019re a natural teacher. And I said well I know but it\u2019s not that easy to find a job. And I just hate having to have that conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">over and over again. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t, why I haven\u2019t found a job. And I haven\u2019t been trying so it\u2019s not it\u2019s more I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20080-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20080-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562486\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: It seems to me that I can\u2019t tell if this is part of what\u2019s painful or not but that he might make you feel like you\u2019re fucking up. First of all you should obviously be at Brown. Second of all if not what the hell\u2019s the matter with you that you couldn\u2019t find a teaching job, what\u2019s going on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200831\">there? In other words it\u2019s not what he\u2019s literally saying; it is where he\u2019s coming from as far as he goes.

In his world I don\u2019t know it seems to me like he doesn\u2019t, he just doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a sense of how hard it could be to find a job in his field or what it might mean not have enough money to live on, what that might feel like. The lawyer I talked to you about is teaching <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200851\">Hebrew and that was the first thing. I really like this; I really would love to do this. I want to find somebody to pay me to do it but they\u2019re not going to. They\u2019re not those jobs aren\u2019t really there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">And he said well you know what most of the teaching I\u2019m doing is volunteer and that\u2019s just so rewarding in these ways. And I said yes I know. It is rewarding but I need to be making enough money to live on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Then there\u2019s this other way that\u2019s not very rewarding at all, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: And, yes, and so he thinks less of me for being tired of living and for wanting to be paid for what I\u2019m doing. And also it\u2019s hard because he does believe in me so much. He believes that I\u2019m so capable and so smart and such a good teacher and so he doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not doing that or <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">using that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Is it true? Sounds like you don\u2019t either. That it doesn\u2019t make sense to you either? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: [Crying] Yes. There\u2019s a part of me obviously that thinks that\u2019s bullshit and can\u2019t do anything and imposturous and all of that, but I\u2019m smart enough to know when I\u2019m the smartest person in the room; I can tell. And I can tell that I\u2019m really good at these things and I can\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">make a complete picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">It\u2019s sort of like I was talking with Candace last night about avoiding stuff. We know this guy that we went to William &amp; Mary with. He\u2019s a decent enough person but he gets pretty solidly uninspired. That\u2019s just who he is. And so he\u2019s been writing for all of these sort of online Catholic journals and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">publications and he sort of just started off being a regular contributor to that other place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">And so I\u2019ve been sort of pushing Candace to blog more because I say Candace you need to be better than him. Nobody wants to hear what he has to say if they can hear what you have to say. And I know it\u2019s not either or; that\u2019s very ungenerous of me and all of that but there it is. She\u2019s just a lot smarter <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">and a much better writer and a lot more interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t make that make sense. Even when I can track down the reason which is basically that Mark\u2019s made it his job to get these jobs. He decided he wanted these and he\u2019s gone after them and Candace hasn\u2019t really done that yet. It just doesn\u2019t, it still doesn\u2019t come together for me. Also <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200951\">he\u2019s a man and he\u2019s white. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562486\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s got those things going for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. Oh God I got so pissed off at Calvary when I realized so they had this lecture series, people coming in to talk about the Old Testament and read the Bible. And we\u2019ve had five speakers and there\u2019s one person of color and one woman and they\u2019re the same person. And she came and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">talked about the Book of Ruth, which let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s the least important part of the Bible. You know it\u2019s like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know the important parts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: Okay, well I mean it\u2019s like Torah, Nevi\u2019im, Ketuvim, the Torah and the prophets and the writings. The writings are the stuff that came last and the stuff that\u2019s sort of peripheral to the central Biblical message. I think that\u2019s the most interesting stuff personally. And so I said well you knew <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">that you had to have some minority people but it just feels like you\u2019re just checking off your boxes and then getting down to the real stuff, which is the white man basically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">So there\u2019s that. And I don\u2019t think anybody who was making that decision noticed that that was what, that\u2019s what was happening, but that\u2019s sort of exactly the point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">I remember once when I was [inaudible at 00:36:13] I was eleven or twelve at school and everybody was doing an art project. At the end of it I said I think I like mine the best and my classmates said you\u2019re terrible, basically you\u2019re a terrible person. You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re better than us. I said <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">no, I don\u2019t think it is the best I just like it the best. They didn\u2019t really get that and I felt bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">[inaudible at 00:37:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: I guess I don\u2019t know what to say. I mean one thing is I mean I guess this sort of is Geoffrey\u2019s thing in Geoffrey\u2019s world where you also live a little bit as well in a way. This stuff that\u2019s happening with you and teaching [inaudible at 00:41:32] just doesn\u2019t make sense. And I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A91\">I guess I think that might be because that you flux (ph) or flattens the world a bit and doesn\u2019t kind of admit or acknowledge things like depression or lots of other stuff. But I mean you\u2019re talking about a lot more than that so I\u2019m not sure what else to say about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: I feel like this is happening a lot recently. I\u2019m just feeling like I can\u2019t put things together in a way that makes sense to me. I guess the last week I\u2019ve been, aside from today, I\u2019ve been pretty cheerful and pretty very high energy and it\u2019s hard. But I\u2019ve also been sort of more aware than <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">usual in that when I\u2019m like that my picture of the world is pretty limited. I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like when I\u2019m not like that. And I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t fit things together somehow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: We should stop now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
