OK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, if \u2013 it is biomechanics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">THERAPIST: But, sometimes, if someone looks at your form, if you have someone who could look at your form or \u2013 things like that slightly change the way you run, and that could maybe help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">CLIENT: Do you run on \u2013 outside or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, always.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20065\">CLIENT: \u2026On the street or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20067\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, people say [inaudible at 00:02:54]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Ice, snow \u2013 I don\u2019t care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2006D\">CLIENT: Wow.

[Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: When I\u2019m pregnant, I swim, too, so I run and swim. But I run a lot and I race a lot.

[Pauses for nine seconds] I\u2019ve been taking care of the body has a lot of positive effects on your mind, as well \u2013 on your mental health, so\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been both down and up for the past few days. I just hurt my back, and that usually gets me really, really depressed because I can\u2019t move. But it is not that bad this time, so I was able to recover much quickly. And recover \u2013 by \u201crecover,\u201d I mean mostly just mentally [chuckles] and emotionally. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A11\">So [pauses] earlier, I would just lie in bed and complain and feel horrible. And, this time, I actually wasn\u2019t \u2013 I tried to stay in bed but I cooked and I had \u2013 was dancing and \u2013 not vigorously but, you know [chuckles], just to not get too depressed. [Pauses] I guess I\u2019m mentioning this just because <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200A12\">I\u2019m also observing that \u2013 I guess part of becoming better, mentally, is how quick your recovery time is, too. Right? [Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Hm. So recovery time from\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">CLIENT: Feeling sad and bad and depressed. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A9\">CLIENT: So\u2026 [Pauses from 00:06:21 to 00:07:00] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB\">Yeah, I guess relating to the question of one thing [ph], that we were talking about last week, I still have to file my taxes and my mom\u2019s. But I really just kind of view that like a picture of what we did last year, and it was like a whole bunch of knots of the financial decisions. I was talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB1\">them [inaudible at 00:07:33] like, \u201cThat is not very wise.\u201d I\u2019m like \u2013 and I didn\u2019t really take it very personally because I knew that they weren\u2019t going to be that wise when I was making them, but it was like I was very on the edge or very desperate to make those changes. For example, all of us \u2013 we <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AB2\">were \u2013 me, Chris [ph], and my mom were living in one apartment, and I was doing [ph] a very wise decision, financially [chuckles] but not quite so emotionally or whatever, so\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD\">[Pauses from 00:08:10 to 00:08:23] Yeah, so moving out and all of us \u2013 all three of us getting our space does mean three times the rent. [Pauses] And I was just looking at that. And I asked my mom, when I was feeling bad, \u201cDid I spend so much money on my rent?\u201d And I made very little, and then pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200AD1\">much 90 percent of it [chuckles] went to rent, either to mine or my mom\u2019s. And then I asked my mom how much she paid for rent, and it was like almost twice as much as how I \u2013 what I paid. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200AC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200AC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562628\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">And I don\u2019t know how she got that number. Maybe she added stuff I paid to hers, but I was just like, \u201cWow.\u201d So it is like, directly, she is paying for my freedom, my dreams and whatnot [chuckles], and that felt \u2013 I don\u2019t know about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">THERAPIST: [Sneezes] Excuse me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Bless you. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: How is she paying for your freedom? I don\u2019t get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Um, [pauses] by [pauses] \u2013 yeah, she is paying out of pocket, like from her savings so I can live separately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Hm. [Pauses] Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: She and I could live together, and we\u2019d save $500, $600 every month. [Chuckles] So [pauses] \u2013 I mean, that \u2013 so I was like, \u201cOh, well, then these are your options. You can do this, you can do this, you can do this and this.\u201d And it was like I can\u2019t [ph] live with my mom, and I\u2019m really happy <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB1\">not [ph] living with her. And what we\u2019ve talked about here, like how, in my narrative, she and I have fused, and I \u2013 whatever has happened to her life, in her life, I feel like, has happened to me, whatever we\u2019ve discussed. So I think living separately has helped me to form my own identity and \u2013 [chuckles] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB2\">so that is \u2013 but, yeah, I was really, really shocked when she told me how much she paid for rent, and I was upset and all that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">But [pauses] yeah, I also, I guess, recovered from it quickly, though. [Chuckles] So [pauses] from the time living [ph] \u2013 I don\u2019t know. [Pauses] Yeah, so I guess I\u2019m thinking about what to do next year, and everyone\u2019s lease is going to go \u2013 end, so what is \u2013 what to do after that? And when we refresh <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD1\">[ph] a little [inaudible at 00:11:40] can save money, but I don\u2019t know. Do you think that is a good idea or a [chuckles] bad idea?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Hm. Only you can make that decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. But, in your opinion\u2026? [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. That is a hard, hard thing. I don\u2019t think it is the decision that you make; it is the \u2013 whether you want to or not that is good or bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: The motivations you have for doing it is what the issue is. Whether you do it or not feels less important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. So the motivation to save money is \u2013 is good or bad, or\u2026?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Or whatever. Each motivation is separate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] You mean if I want to live with her \u2013 if I move in with her because I want to live with her, that is better than moving in with her to save money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CF\">THERAPIST: I guess that is \u2013 that is one way of looking at it, looking at the motivation to your health [ph].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D1\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Do you think I could \u2013 I know what is better for you right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">CLIENT: No. No, just \u2013 whereas, maybe sometimes I might think you might, just because you might have a more objective opinion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">But, [pauses] yeah, I know that you don\u2019t know everything and you don\u2019t know what I \u2013 only I know what I want. [Chuckles] But I guess I\u2019m wondering if you can help me reason or think through things or\u2026 [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DB\">CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. I just don\u2019t know how to go about it. Or maybe I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to go about \u2013 like how to incorporate your [pauses] voice? [Chuckles] So [pauses]\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562628\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: I kind of see that, that you\u2019re trying to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: You know what \u2013 I think what I\u2019ve sort of communicated clearly is that the extent to which you see your mother and you as merged is problematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So the extent to which you make a decision based on that, I would think, is problematic versus other things, which I think is less about the decision than it is about why you\u2019re doing it and what you need from it, and what the wishes\/fantasies are around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: So I feel that way more than the actual decision. Plus, even if a decision is \u201cobjectively good for you,\u201d if it is very painful for you and too hard to tolerate at a given moment, that is not good, either. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">THERAPIST: So [pauses] do I think that, at some point, you fear being on your own for some time is a good thing? Actually, I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Because I think it might be too hard for you to tolerate now, but maybe. So\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">CLIENT: Too hard to tolerate living with her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">THERAPIST: No, living on \u2013 just being on your own, in general, not feeling like you have to be tied to one man or another man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">CLIENT: [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think that is, ultimately, what is good for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: But am I going to tell you to \u2013 what to do with each of these men?

[Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20113\">THERAPIST: Well, we could talk about that, too, if you\u2019d like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20115\">CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20117\">THERAPIST: It is certainly not how you have \u2013 how you think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20119\">CLIENT: About what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Well, you think you need to have one of these two men, and you don\u2019t choose \u2013 you have these two men, and you have to choose between them, and you go back and forth between thinking about one is better than the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011D\">CLIENT: [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2011F\">THERAPIST: And that is how you think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses] That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20123\">THERAPIST: There are times that I have talked to you about a third option, and you kind of look at me as if I have grown an extra head. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20125\">CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, I still look at you like that. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20127\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20129\">CLIENT: But [pauses] \u2013 well, I hear that as I know \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even have time for two of them. I\u2019m having a hard time juggling two. So I run [ph] and then I won\u2019t have any time to do anything else. [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Well, I wasn\u2019t saying a third one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D\">CLIENT: I know, but that is how I\u2019m thinking, thinking I can\u2019t just stop seeing both of them, like just drop them. So a third person wouldn\u2019t be completely new and just the only one; he would be the third person. [Pauses] [Sighs] But, so I\u2019m not that independent right now, or am on a trajectory to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2012D1\">independent, or is that even \u2013 that is not even the trajectory. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562628\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I \u2013 I guess it depends on what you mean by \u201cindependent.\u201d How do you mean \u201cindependent?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: Well, how you meant it, like what you were saying \u2013 living independently and know none of these two men, and \u2013 yeah\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">THERAPIST: Hm. [Pauses] I see why you\u2019re using the word \u201cindependent.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">CLIENT: Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">THERAPIST: But it feels a little bit different \u2013 the coloring of what I\u2019m saying feels a little different even though I understand why you\u2019re using that word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">CLIENT: Hm. [Pauses]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">THERAPIST: I can\u2019t really articulate it at the moment. I know why you\u2019re saying \u201cindependent\u201d versus \u201cdependent.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">CLIENT: Yeah. [Pauses for nine seconds] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">Well, no, just like what you were saying \u2013 [pauses] when you were telling me why you can\u2019t tell me what to do, and then you said, \u201cDo I think you should live independently, independent of these two men?\u201d I think you said that. And you said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not there yet,\u201d or, \u201cWhat is best for you is \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F1\">how do I know what is best for you?\u201d so in that context. You kind of did this picture of me as this strong, independent woman, and then you said, \u201cYou\u2019re not there yet.\u201d So I\u2019m just wondering if that is what you meant or if that is what is good for me. And you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t know what is good for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F2\">me, but, perhaps, that could be good for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">THERAPIST: Well, let me flip it out of ten [ph]. One thing that I think is problematic is that you feel you have to choose between one of these two men.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20145\">THERAPIST: It is just like this is \u2013 these are the only options, somehow, and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20147\">CLIENT: [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20149\">THERAPIST: \u2026So that, I think, is problematic in a lot of different ways. And maybe it is just about being independent; I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014B\">CLIENT: It is tied to being\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D\">THERAPIST: I guess it is. To some extent, it is not like the first thing. I wouldn\u2019t say you do that because you can\u2019t be independent, because, in effect, what does \u201cindependent\u201d mean? I don\u2019t know. [Chuckles] It sort of begs the question, \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2014F\">CLIENT: Well, why is it problematic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20151\">THERAPIST: These \u2013 why? Because it is so limiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20155\">THERAPIST: Because it is not reality. Because there are millions of people out there whom you could \u2013 well, millions \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 several hundred to a thousand of people whom you could maybe partner with at some point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20157\">So the fact that you feel like it is only these two men out there is problematic because it is actually not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20159\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015B\">THERAPIST: It is inaccurate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015D\">CLIENT: [Says faintly] Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2015F\">THERAPIST: But it is certainly based on some feeling or some fantasy, maybe \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I think it is very complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20163\">THERAPIST: But \u2013 so that is why I think that is problematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20165\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I see that you\u2019re questioning my motivations. Yeah.

And I feel horrible and guilty thinking that I\u2019m at Nelson\u2019s place and everyone is here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F\">And I just cooked everyone a very nice meal, and they\u2019re so happy and grateful, and they want me to hang out with them, but I\u2019m shutting myself in the bathroom, thinking of I\u2019m going to him [ph], that he is working right now, that he is all by himself and he is lonely, and that I\u2019ve given him very <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F1\">wrongly perhaps, or maybe there is truth to that, that I\u2019ve given him false hope that [pauses] I want to get back with him [chuckles] when I don\u2019t know if I do. You know? [Pauses] So [exhales] that strong woman can\u2019t happen because this there is a weak one in her place, and it feels really sad, very <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2018F2\">profoundly sad about certain things. And I don\u2019t want to let go of some of that, because it gives me roundness? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20191\">I don\u2019t know. Like the picture I painted earlier is just too [pauses] [chuckles] \u2013 yeah, it is not real, I guess. [Pauses for eight seconds] But then it is not that bad. And this is how I start to recover, is I realize it is actually quite OK and happy being single now. [Chuckles] And he is not profoundly <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201911\">sad like I think he is. And I\u2019ll still see him, and \u2013 in a platonic way, and we\u2019ll figure it out and, [chuckles] so\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20190-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20190-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562628\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">[Pauses for 15 seconds] And I just tell myself, \u201cI\u2019m getting there. I\u2019m becoming strong.\u201d [Chuckles] So [pauses for six seconds] I mean, even strong women cry. Right? [Chuckles] So [pauses for 15 seconds] I see what you\u2019re saying, like these two guys aren\u2019t the only two guys and all, but \u2013 and I see <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201931\">that my motivations definitely need to be questioned, because it is probably fear of loneliness that is driving me to them, and etcetera, etcetera. But I think there is also love, because, as time goes by, and I\u2019m \u2013 days [ph] like ten years have gone by, so there is just not seeing is not an option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">Sometimes, it is really just doesn\u2019t \u2013 yeah. But sometimes the motivation is negative, that, oh, it is fear or guilt, mostly guilt. But when it is not a negative emotion, when the motivation is something positive, then I acknowledge and I act on it, and I observe that interaction as good and healthy, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201951\">and fruitful to both of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: I have no doubt. I don\u2019t feel you\u2019re attached to Chris just for negative reasons or pathologic reasons at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: I think it is extremely complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I see that \u2013 what you\u2019re saying, choosing them or choosing between. And I\u2019m trying to get away from that, but I think that\u2019ll take a \u2013 a bit of time, like a bit more unraveling as to \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 what they mean or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">But it might also just be cultural, maybe?

Right now, choosing \u2013 a big motivation to be with Chris is because \u2013 or choose him as a marriage partner is because I\u2019ve met his parents, and that \u2013 because his parents really expect this of me, and disappointing them \u2013 and I\u2019ve already been disappointing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A31\">them for [chuckles] several years now feels bad. You know? I feel bad about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Well, but that is part of the point, is it is clearly not that that is what is most important to you, because you\u2019d be married already.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: So it is that [chuckles] \u2013 it is just \u2013 it is very complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. No, I\u2019m just saying that I \u2013 I acknowledge their wishes. I see them and I want to honor them, but I don\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">And \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t feel bad not honoring them; I think about it and I feel guilty. [Chuckles] So it is not like, \u201cI\u2019ll just brush it to the side,\u201d and just actualizing [ph] and say, \u201cNope, something else is more important to me. My independence is more important to me.\u201d It is, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD1\">it comes with grief and doing [ph] this is grief. So [pauses] and I don\u2019t think I want to be that way, but just I feel a little grief [ph]. [Chuckles] I don\u2019t think I want it to be that way. [Pauses] I think, a while ago, we talked about how there has been sadness in my life, and I\u2019ve experienced <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD2\">it, and it is \u2013 how do I live with that, how do I [pauses] understand and accept that that is just a part of me that I do have the tendency to go in those deep and sad places. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">For whatever reason, for creativity or just that I have that \u2013 what do you call it? \u2013 dharma [ph], dark side. But I have that gravity. I don\u2019t know if that sounds too lofty, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562628\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: So \u2013 and it is painful, and it is an acquired taste or whatever. [Chuckles] But it is a part of me, so I have to acknowledge it and make an allowance for it. It could mean not being chirpy all the time or needing some alone time to take care of that, to nourish that [pauses] sadness. I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B31\">don\u2019t ever think I can cut it out, and I don\u2019t think that is wrong of me, and I need that fixed. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">[Pauses for 15 seconds] And, also, with Nelson or whatever, I feel like [pauses] the motivation is \u2013 I\u2019ll sit here [ph] and analyze the motivations for seeing him. It is kind of like less so now, in the sense that, earlier, it was just like \u2013 I was thinking, \u201cOh, I should break it off with him,\u201d and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B51\">then I was like, \u201cThat is impossible. Who am I going to drink with and, like, the weekends?\u201d [Chuckles] But, now, I feel like I don\u2019t have so much need for that. I don\u2019t know. It is weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">Last weekend, I went to Ohio, to see him and, soon after, I just came [chuckles] and saw Chris, and he hurt his back, so I was kind of helping him. [Pauses] And I didn\u2019t want to see Nelson, but he came back early this past week. And then, [chuckles] slowly, I got over my anger and [pauses] \u2013 yeah, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B71\">saw him, but [pauses for nine seconds] it is weird. [Chuckles] I don\u2019t know. I feel like he is really supportive or can be very, really supportive [pauses] in a weird way, like\u2026 [Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">So I really tried to break up with him this weekend. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I guess I was thinking about next year and that and Chris had said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to find a job.\u201d Because the past month, I\u2019ve just been looking for jobs and being turned down. And we spoke about that last week [chuckles] <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B91\">my sense of feeling entitled about \u2013 for certain \u2013 for some of these jobs. And, [pauses] yeah, so I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not having my success.\u201d And he was like, \u201cJust move back in here and then you won\u2019t have to worry about rent, and you can help your mom. Then you can make it [ph] and can help your mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B92\">with that,\u201d or, \u201cI can help your mom with the rent, too.\u201d I was just like, \u201cYou\u2019re so kind,\u201d and, \u201cYeah, maybe I should do that.\u201d And, OK, so around \u2013 my lease ends in August. I was telling myself, \u201cI have until August with Nelson.\u201d [Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">But \u2013 so I was trying to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:34:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">CLIENT: What? [Chuckles] [Pauses] Yeah, so I was trying to somehow say something that \u2013 no \u2013 but it didn\u2019t really [chuckles] work. What all do I say? [Pauses] But, first, I said, \u201cIf several of the jobs are not successful, and I\u2019m thinking if I don\u2019t succeed as a writer, my fallback option is that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF1\">going to be a housewife.\u201d I want to have children and this and that, and we talked about children for a bit. And he was like \u2013 he is getting very, very [chuckles] supportive, and he started crying or something, too. And he was like \u2013 so, I guess, for some \u2013 or I bet he was thinking that he \u2013 that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF2\">wanted to marry him, but then I \u2013 and I was like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not right for me. You\u2019re very different, and values are different.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">And then he was crying and he was like, \u201cI want to keep seeing you, but if you don\u2019t think this can work, I understand.\u201d And [chuckles] [pauses] I don\u2019t know. He \u2013 he thinks of the relationship in a very different way. And I keep \u2013 and then I was also joking with him, like, \u201cOh, no, we\u2019re just having <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201C11\">a weekend affair.\u201d Then he was like, \u201cI don\u2019t think of this as just a weekend affair.\u201d [Chuckles] And I was just thinking to myself, \u201cBut, during the week, you don\u2019t even think of me,\u201d or, \u201cYou maybe send one silly text, one day once during the week.\u201d [Pauses] <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562628\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C3\">Yeah, his thinking on the relationship is that he feels great [pauses] and he doesn\u2019t think \u2013 and no one else has loved him like me, and I\u2019m very sweet and considerate and all that. So I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not trying to find fault with that; I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m actually admiring [ph] that he \u2013 it might sound <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C31\">self-centered, but it is a \u2013 that is his perspective. He is very solidly grounded in himself, his needs, and his world, and so he is thinking, \u201cThis relationship brings me a lot of happiness.\u201d And then he says that he has never been happier, and this and that. But it doesn\u2019t mean that he is obsessed <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C32\">or he\u2019d let go of everything else about him and his life to think of me or be with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C5\">So [pauses] \u2013 but I actually respect that. It is quite healthy and a strong individual. [Chuckles] It is \u2013 yeah. [Pauses] And then I told him, \u201cYeah, well, my ex-boyfriend said that I should move in with him so that I don\u2019t have to worry about rent,\u201d and he was like, \u201cWell, here is a counter-offer.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C51\">[Chuckles] And I was like, \u201cThis is the only way that I can get him to make these offers.\u201d And he is like, \u201cMove in with me, but pay me rent.\u201d [Chuckles]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C7\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re leveraging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201C9\">CLIENT: I \u2013 it sounds like that, but I wasn\u2019t, actually. I don\u2019t want to move in with him. [Chuckles] I don\u2019t actually want to move in with Chris, either. Although, I want to move in with Chris more than I want to move in with Nelson. But I actually just want to find my own place [chuckles] and be that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201C91\">strong, independent woman that we talked about earlier. [Chuckles] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB\">So \u2013 [pauses for 23 seconds] yeah, I don\u2019t even think about, oh, Chris is more supportive or he loves me more or cares about me more because he is letting me live with him for free, whereas Nelson is, \u201cNo, just [ph] be independent,\u201d and he is saying, \u201cOh, yeah, financial independence is necessary for <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201CB1\">women,\u201d and lah-lah-lah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD\">I\u2019m hearing both of those things and I\u2019m not evaluating these guys on the basis of who cares about me more; I feel like that is not the point. The point is what I want and how it makes me feel, and I feel like I want my own space, [Chuckles] and I don\u2019t want to depend on either of them. But can I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201CD1\">make that happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Why couldn\u2019t you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D1\">CLIENT: No!

Why couldn\u2019t you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D5\">CLIENT: No, no, I can; it is just [pauses] looking for the job and do I really want to do it at this point when I\u2019m wanting to move full speed ahead with the novel, and I \u2013 so \u2013 but also and not put my mom out on the street. [Chuckles] You know? So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Because your mother isn\u2019t a strong, independent woman? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201D9\">CLIENT: No, no.
