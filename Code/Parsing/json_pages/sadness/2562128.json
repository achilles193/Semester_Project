And so I had to drive to Chicago the next day so I figured yeah. So I just got back from Chicago, literally off the road, but yeah, I was kind of glad because I wanted to get back kind of early. But looking forward to going home. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">I\u2019m just pretty tired. I went from my cousin\u2019s baby shower on Saturday and then hung out with Amanda and the girls yesterday and today, a little bit, and then I left at noon. I was going to see my grandmother but I ended up not having time, but that\u2019s okay; I\u2019ll see her next time. And so it was nice. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">The baby shower was good. I\u2019m starting interviews tomorrow for [inaudible] position at work. [1:07] So I\u2019m not really looking forward to that. Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really feel like I have anything to say right now. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: What pops into your head?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Nothing in particular I don\u2019t think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You mean like your mind is blank or you mean nothing that seems important comes to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think I\u2019m just kind of tired and there\u2019s nothing I really want to expend the energy on talking or something. [2:20] I mean nothing is popping, yeah. No, my mind is not blank but (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I guess if I feel like talking or want to talk I would say [inaudible] say whatever comes to mind, even if it seems irrelevant or trivial or inappropriate or whatever. But if you\u2019re just tired and don\u2019t want to talk, that\u2019s different. [3:25]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s trivial. Well unless you consider just thinking about what I\u2019m going to do when I get home trivial. Well I guess that could be considered trivial. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s considered trivial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s your judgment that\u2026 in other words, I guess part of what I\u2019m saying or another way to put it is I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re saying I don\u2019t\u2026 nothing\u2019s coming to mind that I feel is worth talking about or seems like the right thing to talk about, in which case I\u2019m saying I\u2019d just say whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">comes to mind, whatever\u2019s on your mind, or whether you\u2019re saying if I were feeling less tired I would be just talking about whatever\u2019s coming to mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019m feeling tired so I just don\u2019t feel like talking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yes, that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: That one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s like I got off this drive. I\u2019ve had this nagging headache for over 24 hours now and yesterday it went to migraine level in the evening. And then I laid down and took four ibuprofen and felt better, and then ate something and felt better. [4:38] But\u2026 and then I had coffee and ate today <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">and felt bad, and then, just in the last hour and a half, it started to kind of\u2026 I feel it coming from the back of my head to the front. And I wonder what it\u2019s from, why it was so persistent yesterday that I... I was making it go away by taking Advil or eating or drinking water, whatever, so then it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">kept coming back. And I wonder why it\u2019s going on. And I hope it doesn\u2019t continue into tomorrow. That\u2019s also what I\u2019m thinking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: I kind of imagine something else that\u2019s not exactly putting you in the mood to talk about death, [ph?] having a headache.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Feeling crummy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562128\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. And I think also when I drive I\u2019ve just been thinking about stuff. Driving\u2026 making that drive alone all the time is really kind of exhausting. I do get some good thinking done but it\u2019s also, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not my favorite thing to do. [6:10] (pause) I\u2019m really not into these interviews <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">tomorrow. I kind of wish I didn\u2019t have to do them, somebody else [inaudible] but I have to do them. (pause) Is it weird to go into therapy and not have anything to say, or not want to talk? Not\u2026 I keep saying I have nothing to say, but it\u2019s not that. I\u2019m just tired. Or maybe I feel like I\u2019ve been talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">to myself for the last four hours so I\u2019m already exhausted about thinking of things, whatever things [inaudible] my mind over, mulling them over. [8:48] (pause)I feel like I don\u2019t sleep that well at Amanda\u2019s either. I mean there\u2019s a bed for me but it\u2019s really hard and I feel like it\u2019s cold and maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">I just come back tired because I don\u2019t sleep that well or something, or maybe that\u2019s the headache problem because I slept two nights in a row. (pause) I think I\u2019m seeing Dr. Gillingham [ph?] this week to get a refill. I think I should just keep doing the ten milligrams. [10:41] It seems to be good. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">It doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s too many side effects. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I think when people that are\u2026 people coming to therapy are quiet, sort of, that happens for different reasons. I don\u2019t have a sense for you today that it\u2019s any other than feeling kind of wiped out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking more about my bed that I am about I\u2019m going to be single forever, something like that. Or what I\u2019m going to eat for dinner. [11:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Would you rather go? I mean stay, chill out, it\u2019s fine with me. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I mean yeah, I could go. Is that a weird thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: No, you should do what you want. It\u2019s\u2026 this is for you. You should do what you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: I hear you. I\u2019m thinking, also, I was a little bit thinking maybe I should\u2019ve cancelled this appointment, and then I was like no, I don\u2019t think [inaudible] but then I think I just wasn\u2019t expecting to be so tired when I got off the road. There wasn\u2019t a lot of traffic today, which I was expecting, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">maybe, because it was a holiday weekend. But I think a lot of people had to work today or something. [12:57] Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I could talk about tomorrow and having to interview, and I just feel like I\u2019ve done it so many times at this point I\u2019m not even going to have questions in front of me. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">just going to roll with it and ask whatever comes to mind. And of course I\u2019m joking around with myself, like I\u2019m going to ask if they know how to use Google and are willing to do so without instructions to. I\u2019m interviewing two people that are overqualified but one is a cousin of a current employee, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200393\">another is a friend of Clark\u2019s [ph?] And they\u2019re both older and more\u2026 over qualified but want this job for some reason. And I\u2019m interviewing one friend of Melody\u2019s [ph?] but maybe she\u2019s good. I don\u2019t know. And then I\u2019m interviewing the girl that already works there that sucks and I would never hire. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200394\">I would literally throw her resume away as soon as I saw it if it were the real world. But I have to interview her. And it\u2019s going to be very awkward because I really don\u2019t want to hire her and I think she\u2019s s going to\u2026 we\u2019ll see how she does in the interview but I\u2019m not convinced that she\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200395\">blow me out of the water and be like oh my God, where\u2019s this great candidate been hiding. [14:39] I just feel like I want to get them over with because then I don\u2019t have to worry about the second interviews, and I don\u2019t have to really worry about it until I get back. So maybe this is why I don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200396\">to talk about anything because I don\u2019t feel like thinking about all this stuff right now. I have to think about it tomorrow morning on my commute into work and so I was like eh. That\u2019s what the weekends are for, to not have something [inaudible] Although I suppose it is Monday, though it\u2019s a holiday <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200397\">so it doesn\u2019t count. (pause) Oh, I have to cancel two appointments with you. Maybe we should do that now.
