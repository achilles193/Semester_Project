Yeah, so the whole health insurance thing is all fucked up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I just couldn\u2019t afford it, so the deadline passed. I just couldn\u2019t so it sucks. Well it sucks and it doesn\u2019t. I mean it\u2019s like $490 a month, so even if I wasn\u2019t paying which is very nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: It was $490? I thought you said it was $300.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: No, it was $480; it was in the 4s. No, the 3 was the when I called directly and yeah, it was like $390, $380, whatever, for the if you go directly through Brown Pilgrim. But the COBRA was $490 or 4 something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: I totally not I misheard you then. I thought you said it was $380 versus $390 before. [00:01:01.21] So that makes a big difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: No, no. It was in the $400s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well and even if it even with the private even $390, it\u2019s like I get $400 a week. It\u2019s just it\u2019s a clusterfuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: You could get on the state insurance then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: So yeah, so now I just I\u2019m doing the application today, again, for whatever it was. Yeah, which means things here stay the way they are. Okay, so for now, we\u2019re okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: \u2018Til next summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Well yeah, hopefully. Jesus. Yeah, hopefully way before then things change. Well they kind of have to. [00:02:02.15] I mean I only have unemployment til whatever, another 5, 4 months, whatever it is. So, yes, there\u2019s lots going on. I can\u2019t even describe like how I\u2019ve been feeling. It\u2019s crazy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">So the last few days I had a terrible stomach thing going on. Partly, I think, brought on because I made the dudes at Leo\u2019s make me a bacon, egg and cheese between two pancakes, and by the time I got halfway through it, I was already not feeling so great. But then I started getting a pain which I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">never like a pain over here, and it lasted for like til yesterday. Thank God today it seems to be better, but and I was like well, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t didn\u2019t help what I ate. But I think it\u2019s also like stress, probably. [00:03:02.09] I\u2019m like really I\u2019ve never felt this on the one hand this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200253\">like hungry or motivated to make real money. But also I\u2019ve never been this broke, in a long time. So that\u2019s kind of a weird place to be in. It doesn\u2019t feel so good. But this is what I the interesting part of what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t feel depressed really. You know what I mean? Like I just feel super <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200254\">fucking motivated. Like I\u2019ve been looking up things like joining a clinical trial. You know what I mean? Ways to make cash. You know what I mean? Like I totally understand now in a way where my family I\u2019ve always kind of known this, but now that I\u2019m in this position, I kind of see where my family <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200255\">or people like immigrants this country\u2019s all about having a business. [00:04:10.06] It really is a land of if you can just work your ass off and have a good idea, it totally is a land of opportunity, in the sense that like because I was saying okay, what so I\u2019m going to like Levi\u2019s is hiring, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200256\">I just saw. So I\u2019m going to go work at Levi\u2019s with a bunch of 25 year olds for $8 an hour? Know what I mean? Like I totally understand that mentality of well, good for you. But that\u2019s just a way to stress yourself out and really still make no money. For a place like Boston that\u2019s just not it\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200257\">doing anything. It\u2019s just a little pocket change I guess or whatever. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not no money, but it\u2019s not a lot of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s no money for someone like in my position I think. If you\u2019re 25...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Versus having no money, it\u2019s money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You know what I mean. It\u2019s money but it\u2019s money that will just get you to next week. [00:05:01.23] It\u2019s not money that will do anything, other than just get you through the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: But it does get you through the week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: But I\u2019m getting through the week, right? I mean if it\u2019s just about bare bones getting through, I\u2019m doing that. So but like I feel motivated to do more than that. You know what I mean? I\u2019m really like enough is enough. For someone with my skills and talents and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not good enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, like this is ridiculous. You know what I mean? So I\u2019ve been like even I\u2019m not done with giving up like buying a house. I was like how can this not be possible. It\u2019s got to be possible. So I\u2019ve been scouring like finding private investors. It\u2019s called hard money. There are lots of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">people that have money that want a good return on their money. A bank\u2019s going to give you 2%, 1%, whatever it is. Anyone who has money already knows about investing, if they have a brain, so if someone comes to them, says look, I\u2019m going to buy this three family, I\u2019m going to give you 10% return, 20% <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">return, here are all the numbers, here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work. [00:06:10.20] I have a house. And obviously we\u2019re going to buy a house so that\u2019s your you\u2019re going to take the house if I can\u2019t pay you. You know what I mean? These things are kind of it\u2019s just about finding that money. You know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200353\">I mean? And that\u2019s not impossible at all. I mean I know people, a lot of these fucking immigrants, that\u2019s how they\u2019ve done it. How do you think they got Leo\u2019s place? They literally asked all their friends for money. So like I\u2019m just tired of I\u2019ve got to just make shit happen now. I\u2019m tired of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200354\">nonsense of and even with like the life coaching, I do need a little startup money. Like I can\u2019t I need the office space. It\u2019s only like $300 a month for that share. I don\u2019t have $300. I can\u2019t just put that out. [00:07:01.09] But it\u2019s a catch-22. I can\u2019t start getting clients and then scramble for <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200355\">a place to meet. And even like one of my friend was like and also like a business address. I don\u2019t want to use my house as a business address. I mean you don\u2019t know what kind of people you\u2019re going to deal with. I just don\u2019t want them to know where I live. So I was like you know what? I\u2019m just going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200356\">to maybe just ask one of my friends or two of my friends that look, I need like $500 or $1000 and I\u2019ll give you back $1200 or whatever. I just I\u2019m starting a business. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">It just seems absurd to be honest. It\u2019s not even depressing anymore it\u2019s just absurd. So in that way I\u2019m not like skipping down the street. [00:08:04.26] I mean I\u2019ve been really stressed, but it\u2019s a motivated stress. I\u2019ve been up late at night looking at a gazillion fucking websites, figuring out which <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">one\u2019s a scam. You know what I mean? There\u2019s a lot of things out there, like how to buy a house with no money down. That\u2019s bullshit. You need fucking cash to buy a house. At the same time there are a lot of really good blogs. I mean people do it. This is a real thing. So there\u2019s that. I\u2019ve been looking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">into like Brown, like making some money on clinical trials or, I don\u2019t know, fucking medical trials. I don\u2019t know, just to make some cash man. One really historic thing that happened, I still kind of don\u2019t believe it, but I guess it happened. [00:09:00.07] Yesterday I had I don\u2019t know what made me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200373\">do this, but I was like you know what? I\u2019m going to go I\u2019m on creditkarma.com. I don\u2019t know if you know that site It\u2019s a really I recommend it. I mean I don\u2019t know, but I really recommend it. It\u2019s a really good site. It\u2019s very it\u2019s laid out in a very simple, user friendly way with your credit <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200374\">score and all your accounts, whatever, all this shit. So yeah, my credit\u2019s bad, whatever. But it had improved a little bit after the consolidation and all that. And for some reason I didn\u2019t check with everything else going on, I hadn\u2019t so I checked it and I was like whoa, it\u2019s almost fair now. They <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200375\">have poor, fair, good, great, whatever. I\u2019m like holy shit, it\u2019s almost fair. That\u2019s awesome. And right next to it it said hey, your credit\u2019s improved. You\u2019re qualified for certain credit cards, blah, blah, blah. [00:10:01.02] I was like what? And I was like you know what? That would help if I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200376\">had that. I mean that\u2019s how a lot of these idiots do these if I just had my if I still had my AmX right now I wouldn\u2019t need someone to give me $1000, you know what I mean? I\u2019d just do it just like I was doing it. Just pay them back. So anyway I went on there and I got approved for I mean for $300 <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200377\">credit limit but that\u2019s a huge deal. That\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s also not nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Well and that\u2019s a lot of something because that means I can fucking quickly just do little things and pay off keep improving my credit. Buy gas, pay it off. Buy this, pay it off. So that was I don\u2019t know. I mean I still kind of don\u2019t it almost seemed too I\u2019m so used to being rejected with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">that shit and everything I was like really? I don\u2019t know. But so that felt good. [00:11:02.03] But it also did make I was like I can\u2019t believe this, I had anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Had what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Just it\u2019s I\u2019m still like I haven\u2019t like that AmX thing really fucked with me. That really pissed me off. To have a credit card where you are paying every month and then to just have it be like oops, sorry, we looked at your credit and no credit card for you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re that\u2019s such <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">an asshole thing to do to people. Anyway, but anyway, so now I\u2019m like that\u2019s really awesome. That makes me feel because I was like oh, I\u2019m going to have to get a secured card. But you\u2019ve got to put the money into that to you\u2019ve got to tie up your cash to get a secured that\u2019s really cool. Unsecured. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">That\u2019s I can\u2019t ask that\u2019s fantastic. That means I have just a little bit more, a few more months, hopefully, it should be better. So I don\u2019t know. [00:12:06.22] Really a few people have been asking me like so have you launched your business. And really I don\u2019t have an excuse anymore. I am ready <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F3\">to launch it. I didn\u2019t send you the website, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">CLIENT: No? I\u2019m sorry. I wanted you to look at it. But launch it and do what? If people if even one person calls me and wants an appointment, where am I going to fucking meet them? Like I don\u2019t want to do this half assed. I\u2019m not going to meet people at Levi\u2019s or in my house or so I need to, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">know. I need to see if one of my friends might be willing to spot me. So it\u2019s a lot. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been on my mind. Oh, and Julia has cancer. [00:13:05.08]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: Oh, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: They found something in her breast, and I guess she\u2019d been having like really serious back pain and they\u2019re worried it might be in her bones or something. Unbelievable. I guess these things I\u2019m trying to maybe they can do something and she\u2019s hopefully. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s horrible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So (pause) I didn\u2019t get in touch with that Allison chick since I was here. [00:14:12.19] Today she got in touch with me. That\u2019s a whole other fucking saga. Meanwhile I went on a date with this chick. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know what to make anymore of myself in relation to broads. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">I don\u2019t. I had a date with this chick who I always thought was kind of hot. And again, like we went out, she took me back to her place, it was all very we didn\u2019t have sex but it was there was a lot of stuff that happened. And now she\u2019s like you know, I haven\u2019t felt this way in a long time. I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">what the fuck is happening here. [00:15:02.01] Because I\u2019m not I don\u2019t think I\u2019m into it in terms of a serious thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: She\u2019s got a really big head, kind of. I know that sounds really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Literally?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, kind of. She\u2019s a taller girl. She\u2019s a little taller than me so and the rest of her\u2019s pretty awesome. She\u2019s just looks a little disproportionate, and I kind of can\u2019t get over that. It\u2019s pretty she\u2019s pretty, just not it\u2019s not for me I think. I know that sounds awful, I know it sounds <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">awful, but you know what you can deal with and what you can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s how you work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: When you say that you know. You say that as if that\u2019s the way everybody works [inaudible] standard checklist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s not a standard I mean I think everybody has something that they can\u2019t I mean look at all the fucking women that are like oh, I won\u2019t date a dude that\u2019s like under 5\u20199\u201d. They just won\u2019t. [00:16:00.16] I mean there are a lot of people that have there\u2019s one there\u2019s something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">you just you can\u2019t really get...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But something is different than a long checklist, including like I never heard you mention that she can\u2019t have a big head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Well because it never has been an issue. But in this case, maybe because she\u2019s already she\u2019s a taller girl, so it\u2019s just again it\u2019s all about proportions. I just feel a little bit I mean it\u2019s not just that. It\u2019s also I think just the circle her circle of people. I\u2019ve gotten more cognizant <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">of that when I get together with someone. What is their circle. And her circle let\u2019s say we got into something serious. Are those the people I want to hang out with? Not really. They\u2019re not bad people but they\u2019re definitely I would just be wasting my time a little bit. They\u2019re her a lot of her <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">she\u2019s pretty cool. [00:17:02.26] But a lot of her friends are in these stupid cabaret things. These chicks that do all this you know what I\u2019m talking about? There\u2019s a whole trend now of cabaret where basically it\u2019s a titillating porno but we\u2019re all at a theater and it\u2019s supposedly you know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F3\">I mean? It\u2019s just fucking retarded. It\u2019s for women that have a lot of issues that they would just be making real money stripping instead of pretending that they\u2019re artists or whatever. So she has a lot of friends like that. I don\u2019t know. Like there\u2019s just something I just I don\u2019t see it. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F4\">what I mean? I don\u2019t see and now I\u2019m really it\u2019s such a small fucking town I\u2019m very careful now. It\u2019s like if we kind of date for a while and it doesn\u2019t work out, then it\u2019s like I know these people. And I\u2019m just worried about that. You know what I mean? I\u2019m so sick of that everywhere I go I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F5\">know people. [00:18:01.24] I don\u2019t know. So there\u2019s that. Meanwhile, out of the blue, on okay stupid I struck up a correspondence with this chick in Delaware, okay. At first I was like hmmm. But we started corresponding and she\u2019s like really, really cool, like really, really cool. We talked on the phone <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F6\">a couple of times, like she just lost her dad like a year ago. I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s just a lot of I don\u2019t know. We just have this weird connection. It\u2019s really weird. So yeah, so now we\u2019re I\u2019m kind of like in this place like ah, you know what I mean? It\u2019s five hours away, but on the other hand <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F7\">I\u2019m like but you can\u2019t you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re going to meet that is worth some effort. [00:19:12.04] I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s just a really cool person. There\u2019s something about her that\u2019s like she\u2019s artsy and all that shit, but there\u2019s something very down to earth and not pretentious and very genuine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F8\">She\u2019s like oh, I listened to your music; it\u2019s so beautiful. And she went and watched me on Vimeo doing my reading, and she\u2019s like you\u2019re really a talented person. What an interesting person. Just very there\u2019s something, what\u2019s the word, effusive or that just seems genuine. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F9\">so I don\u2019t know. So then there\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] just to tell you she looked up your stuff and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s just a sweet thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: There with her interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. No, she\u2019s been no, we\u2019ve both been pretty she\u2019s like I\u2019m not going to lie. [00:20:03.23] You\u2019re my top okay stupid person. You\u2019re so I don\u2019t know. So there\u2019s that. Who the fuck knows. And then all these things then bring me back to money. Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">I might drive down there next week to see her because I\u2019m like I think I need something like that. I\u2019m unemployed. All my friends are telling me to enjoy it. You know what I mean? And I haven\u2019t done shit. It\u2019s just gas, and it\u2019s Delaware. I\u2019m sure I can get a motel for $50 or something like that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200672\">I don\u2019t know. But that reminds me of you know what I mean? If I had my AmX even that. That one little thing. It wouldn\u2019t even be a question. That gives you some breathing room to do a couple of things that are not about hard cash. [00:21:01.20] Anyway. And also kind of the embarrassment a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200673\">bit. I don\u2019t want to tell a girl I just met that I\u2019m oh, and the absurdity. I\u2019m so I\u2019m literally so I had $6 in my account yesterday by the way. I got my unemployment today, but I\u2019m already like all right, by the time five days go by I\u2019m going to be back to the idea that I had $6 in my account <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200674\">but a three unit house that\u2019s worth over $700,000 is that\u2019s just it\u2019s hard to take. You know what I mean? It\u2019s just really hard to take. So just to be able to explain that. I don\u2019t want to explain money. I don\u2019t like talking about money, especially you\u2019re getting to know people. It\u2019s just not (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20069\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] have a professional come that you can rely upon. [00:22:08.00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006B\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006D\">THERAPIST: In a more regular way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F\">CLIENT: Exactly, that reflects my abilities. That\u2019s what I\u2019m realizing more and more. I can\u2019t just oh it\u2019s a job, I\u2019ll take this job. Now I\u2019ll take that job. It\u2019s I\u2019m it\u2019s been like chicks. It\u2019s just floating from one thing to another and not thinking about, wait a second, a) do I really want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F1\">do this every day; b) is it reflecting is the income and what I\u2019m doing, just the activity, reflecting what the fuck I\u2019m capable of and what my skills are, what I want to (pause) So, this is all to say, somehow, that I guess I could be more depressed than I am. [00:23:03.18] I don\u2019t feel depressed. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F2\">I just feel really motivated and at the most, like I said, I feel the stress and frustration of knowing like I feel really confident. I feel like this shit\u2019s going to happen. You know what I mean? Now I\u2019m just antsy. Like now I\u2019m just about how do I make it happen sooner rather than later. I guess in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F3\">a way that\u2019s good. Yesterday I finally saw my uncle. He was over our house. So I told him. And I even liked the way I talked about it. Because definitely I think he was kind of skeptical. I could just kind of like and also, are immigrants or even just certain kinds of people, I think, other types <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F4\">really like oh, now he\u2019s a life coach. [00:24:03.12] You know what I mean? I think I have a feeling my family or some members of my family or whatever, there probably is a little bit of a I\u2019m so just not the conventional oh, now he\u2019s in graduate school, oh, now he\u2019s a writer, now like when is he <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2006F5\">going to make up his mind. All this shit. So there\u2019s a little bit of that. But what I liked, though, was I didn\u2019t care about any of that. The way I talked about it was so clear and confident and point by point. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20071\">THERAPIST: You could still feel clear and confident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, I didn\u2019t really even when I felt him a little bit like, whatever, I didn\u2019t need the validation. I was like this is going to happen and whatever. And then as we talked he was like that sounds like a great idea. He\u2019s like see, if you can make that in a place like Boston, he\u2019s like, there\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">a lot of money here. [00:25:00.22] If you could make that work. He\u2019s like what a wonderful business. And it was weird. My mom was so yeah, it\u2019s awesome. She\u2019s like he\u2019s so smart. All these years he studied so hard. He can finally like help people and also use his brain. And he\u2019s such a good speaker. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200732\">That\u2019s so funny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s getting on board with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: She\u2019s it\u2019s weird. She\u2019s been on board since Dad told what is that. And I explained it to her. She\u2019s like that sounds amazing. Who knows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: So the next steps are pretty concrete ones then, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B\">CLIENT: I think the two things left that I want to do the website can always be tweaked. I feel like enough people have seen I mean I would love for you to see it, but enough people have seen it, I think, and they\u2019ve all been very honest, so it\u2019s good enough to start a business. To just start, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B1\">know what I mean? I think there should be maybe two forms. I just want to make sure my ass is covered. So even on the website I\u2019m very clear about the whole section that\u2019s what is life coaching really is. It really I wrote it in a way that what it isn\u2019t. You know what I mean? So I really over and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B2\">over it\u2019s just not therapy. But there should be something that they sign that says I understand that this is not therapy. That\u2019s one. And two, I think I need them to sign something that says this is a service and there are no guarantees. People can\u2019t come back a month later and be like I saw this life <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B3\">coach and nothing happened. It doesn\u2019t work that way. That\u2019s like me it\u2019s like suing a psychologist. These are it\u2019s what you put into it, and there\u2019s no it\u2019s not like changing a muffler. [00:27:00.09] So I think those two things I want to I just don\u2019t want any issues. And then just the space. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007B4\">And then well, and then also, I am kind of not sure how to get clients yet. I\u2019m trying to figure that out. You know what I mean? Like on Facebook, whatever, but I\u2019m trying to figure...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007D\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] you\u2019re going to do any marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah, like how what\u2019s in a way that\u2019s not cheesy. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to figure that out. But I mean I figure with Facebook, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve got like 1500 friends or whatever it is. If we could start somewhere kind of. That\u2019s all you need, one or two people. That was one of my uncle\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2007F1\">things. He\u2019s such a businessman. He\u2019s like well at that rate, he\u2019s like really all you need is just a couple of clients and you\u2019d just get the ball rolling. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20081\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t know anyone in the business. [00:28:15.17]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20083\">CLIENT: I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: Around town, you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20087\">CLIENT: I do, yeah, my friend Eva.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20089\">THERAPIST: Does she have an office?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Well, so she doesn\u2019t work so she did everything. She works for a company. So she doesn\u2019t work privately as a life coach. But she\u2019s the one I think I told you was like I can get you a discount when you want to be certified and give me some tips and all that. Most of these people, like I said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">do it by Skype and phone. And I just I guess I could start that way but that\u2019s one...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a cheap way to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a are you kidding?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: Even if you don\u2019t want to do that in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: Oh, are you kidding? My uncle\u2019s like what? He\u2019s like that\u2019s amazing. He was like no overhead. But I just I am skeptical somehow. I don\u2019t know. Maybe because I\u2019m so used to this. [00:29:01.07] I\u2019m like how could someone benefit from a phone call. I don\u2019t but according to everything I\u2019ve read <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200931\">it\u2019s about convenience, comfort, the fact that this isn\u2019t therapy. So it\u2019s not this level of you know what I mean? It\u2019s different. And that a lot of these people are successful people or they\u2019re busy people or it\u2019s actually easy for them to do it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve certainly heard of it being over the phone a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: I couldn\u2019t believe it. And yeah, they kind of emphasize that, actually. And as a matter of fact, now that you\u2019re saying that, I don\u2019t remember on these websites seeing an office address. You know what I mean? I just see like a contact me. But I don\u2019t see like this is where my Hilliard Street <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">or whatever. I guess, yeah. I guess I could just start and just but see, that\u2019s where I worry if someone wanted to meet me in person then although I guess even then I could just make an appointment for like two weeks down the road or a week down the road and then just get my...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20099\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] then.

[00:31:03.11] A lot of these websites, like the kind of not the bigger but the ones with the fancy websites and all that stuff, they\u2019re definitely more I was telling my uncle that. I\u2019m like because he asked me so like what is the credentialing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF1\">or licensing, and I was like that\u2019s the thing. A lot of these websites, when you look at their bio, it\u2019s not they don\u2019t even say anything in their bio. Abby has been life coaching for ten years. And she like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not credentialed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah, there\u2019s nothing specific. There\u2019s just this nice picture of Abby that she\u2019s been in the business for ten years and has successful whatever. Like nothing says where she went to school, where she and then there\u2019ll be some other people that are like I have a master\u2019s in it\u2019s a hodgepodge of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not a regulated profession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">CLIENT: Interesting. Okay, so that means I guess I could yeah I could start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I was also thinking about that because if there were someone whose office you knew or someone else in some other field, sometimes in this field people sublease space to other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BB\">CLIENT: My friend Lucy...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BD\">THERAPIST: For a very small amount. Not $10 an hour for example. So if you wanted two hours from someone you could pay for that and that would cost less than your $300. [00:32:14.22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200BF\">CLIENT: My friend Lucy, she\u2019s a social worker. She said that too. She said they have offices for like $8, $10. I could yeah, that\u2019s a good idea. I could do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It takes some looking at. You\u2019d have to kind of get in the network to figure out...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it wouldn\u2019t be that I mean I know enough people who are either doing this or social workers or whatever. It just seems like I guess it wouldn\u2019t be that difficult. Because it sounds like it\u2019s probably the kind of thing where someone just has to vouch for you so you\u2019re not going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C31\">destroy someone\u2019s office or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think the hardest thing will be finding someone who\u2019s wanting someone to be in the office for two hours versus having someone oh I need someone part time. I want 20 hours a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: That seems at least my experience that\u2019s been so you\u2019d have to look for a while, but that could be something you start asking around about. [00:33:03.16]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: Yeah, I could even say all right, fine, give me five hours a week, ten hours a week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Which would still be five would be $200 if it were $10 an hour. $200 a month instead of $300. Work Saturdays. Sometimes people have a few hours they\u2019re open on a Saturday; they\u2019re not in the office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">CLIENT: But yeah, no, that\u2019s a good I guess now I should really think about how do these people advertise. Because I haven\u2019t figured that out actually. Their websites are there but I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re you know what I mean? I don\u2019t know if they just, like me, just kind of scrapped in the beginning <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF1\">and now it\u2019s just people tell people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s often why typically it takes people a couple of years to get really feeling like they\u2019re making an income.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">CLIENT: I mean I know one thing I could do is tap into the Brown there\u2019s alumni, whatever, bulletins, things like that I could just I\u2019m here. [00:34:05.27]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">THERAPIST: All the places where people might be looking for that. You can start sending your bio or your card and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s the other thing. Yeah, get business cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D9\">THERAPIST: What\u2019s it like to be talking about this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s kind of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Nuts and bolts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s kind of I mean it\u2019s awesome. Like I said I\u2019m just I\u2019m antsy. You know what I mean? I just again it\u2019s like the guy in the coma that woke up and now he\u2019s so lucid and now it\u2019s just about like not even catching up, just like I don\u2019t know. I just feel such confidence that <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF1\">whatever these couple of things I\u2019ve been that they are going to happen, that now it\u2019s just about how do I not dilly dally, and how do I find the most efficient, best way to make these things happen faster, rather than it feels good. [00:35:11.24] No, it\u2019s great. And also I like to get feedback. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200DF2\">I want that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been asking people. I\u2019m totally when I did the website I\u2019m like just fucking tell me. Take this [inaudible] I don\u2019t give a shit. I just want to get this thing going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I mean I can already imagine my feedback, without seeing your website, would be probably the first thing would be just to do it, just to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E3\">CLIENT: That\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E5\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sure it looks great. You know what I mean? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a matter of oh you should really take that word out and then you can get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E7\">CLIENT: I guess. I just I do feel like it\u2019s you want to put forward such a profe I want to make sure it\u2019s professional. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m overthinking it. I\u2019m definitely overthinking it. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200E9\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not trusting yourself enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB\">CLIENT: I mean I\u2019ve never started a business. And this is a business where I do feel responsible. People are going to come to me for it\u2019s kind of a big deal. [00:36:05.21] You know what I mean? And I know I\u2019ll be really good at it but yeah, it\u2019s I feel a little nervous and but yeah, no, I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200EB1\">it is time to just suck it up and make there\u2019s not much else I can do. It\u2019s just time to find clients and just ramp it up. I think I also feel a little shy. Like on Facebook I feel a little I don\u2019t know. I still feel a little bit like shy. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">THERAPIST: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">CLIENT: I kind of don\u2019t like the word life coach. I don\u2019t like what it\u2019s called. You know what I mean? It\u2019s like yeah, I\u2019m a life I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019ve got to you know what I\u2019m saying? I feel a little no?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know what that means for you. Something...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">CLIENT: Sounds a little foofy or it sounds like I\u2019m trying to be on Oprah or something. [00:37:03.16] I don\u2019t know, life coach just sounds...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Maybe it\u2019s hard to take into reality that that is what you\u2019re talking about. That is what you\u2019re going to be doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">CLIENT: It is. And when I talk to people about it I\u2019m fine. There\u2019s something about announcing it to like 1500 people on Facebook that I feel a little wacky about. But no, I think it\u2019s time. It\u2019s time. And I think it\u2019s also time for me to remember that everyone I tell about this is they all think <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F71\">it\u2019s a great some random chick yesterday at the bar after practice, she asked all of us what we do, whatever, and I told her. She\u2019s like oh my God, I needed you like three months ago. I mean it\u2019s I think it\u2019s definitely between this my uncle said yesterday too, he was telling my mom, he\u2019s like <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F72\">because my mom\u2019s like why would rich people want to see you. [00:38:00.09] It\u2019s that old like when you have a lot of money, what problems do you have. You know what I mean? My uncle\u2019s like well, most rich people have psychologists already, so he\u2019s like what Arto\u2019s doing would just be the other part <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200F73\">of that. That one is for their mental health and the other one is for feeling stuck about their future plans, about things they\u2019re trying to accomplish. It\u2019s kind of perfect for around here. That\u2019s my mom was like really, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">THERAPIST: So in terms of life coaching, how are we doing here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">CLIENT: Good. Oh, you\u2019re amazing. Are you kidding me? You got both bases covered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. I mean I was thinking about you\u2019ve said a number of times oh, I have a hard time taking my own advice, feeling stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: But that\u2019s getting better. But look how much that\u2019s improved. [00:39:04.19] I mean I get $400 in a place like this I get $400 a week. I got fired from my job. I mean this is a lot. All the shit I\u2019ve been overcoming here, it\u2019s a lot. You know what I mean? I have my days. You know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF1\">But like I\u2019m just not depressed really. Yesterday when I went to practice I still felt kind of wacky, whatever. It was hot. It gets hot as hell in our practice room. Played great. We had a great set. We have a show Friday. I\u2019m not nervous about it. I\u2019m just I mean like there\u2019s something going on that <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF2\">I feel it\u2019s not about being happy or depressed. It\u2019s just about I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m totally content, but I\u2019m content at the fact that I\u2019m not losing my mind or a depressed case. [00:40:03.07] And that really things aren\u2019t that bad. I mean the fact is it\u2019s only $400 but somehow I\u2019m getting by. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF3\">ask my mom for anything. Like I don\u2019t need I\u2019m not asking friends for loans because I don\u2019t have any money to buy groceries. You know what I mean? Like I\u2019m making it work one way or the other. And I\u2019m the most important thing is that I\u2019m that\u2019s the part about taking your own advice. Like I\u2019m motivated <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF4\">to make shit happen. No one\u2019s stopping me from accomplishing these things. It\u2019s a little difficult and it\u2019s frustrating as soon as I feel like I don\u2019t have help or just I\u2019m kind of alone in it. And it\u2019s hard to talk to people about these things, your friends. But that\u2019s so what. That\u2019s there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF5\">people working at McDonald\u2019s who have literally that\u2019s all they have. [00:41:02.16]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N200FE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561716\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20101\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s actually the part that I if I feel anxious for you about this particular path in life coaching, it does have to do [inaudible] what training is going to end up feeling missing once you\u2019re in it. If you run a third session with somebody and all of a sudden you start feeling in over <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201011\">head, like what am I doing and where is my teacher right now. Because it is profession but there\u2019s a lot more to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20103\">CLIENT: There\u2019s got to be some methodology. There\u2019s going to be yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20105\">THERAPIST: And that, I think, relatedly is having also community of to sort of even if that\u2019s where you get to turn to. Like peer supervision group or colleagues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20107\">CLIENT: Well my thinking is I\u2019ve already I\u2019ve thought that through. My thinking\u2019s that the minute I have a client I\u2019m going to be doing a shitload of homework. In other words, before I see them I want to have that shit. Okay, if this is our third session, all right, this is what happened the last <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201071\">sessions, I\u2019m going to you know what I mean? These are the things we\u2019re going to talk about. These are the things I want to ask. [00:42:03.25] These are you know what I mean? That\u2019s one. And two, the minute I have a client then that\u2019s when I am going to reach out to Eva or look, now I have clients. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201072\">Is there a way I don\u2019t know, just..<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20109\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I don\u2019t know how it works in that field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, there\u2019s no question. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010D\">THERAPIST: To share dilemmas, to ask questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F\">CLIENT: Of course, of course. Yeah, there\u2019s no way that I would just totally wing it. Because also you\u2019re making an impression. You\u2019re trying to grow a business. So these people have to be satisfied. So I mean that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. As soon as I have the money I\u2019m absolutely going to get certified. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F1\">Why the fuck not. I mean especially when I know someone who\u2019s trustworthy, who says this is the best program and it\u2019s of course I\u2019d do it.
