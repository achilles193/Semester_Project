From that and from our discussion a couple weeks before <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I was able to talk to some of my closest friends about my feelings about Reika (?) which was really good, a very positive experience. It started off with my friend Cody who I think of as one of my most loyal friends and so in a sense he was the person that I was most afraid of expressing these views <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">to. Also similar people in our internal structure if not anything else he\u2019s a poet and I\u2019m a chemist so the similarities are internal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: So I wanted to say Thank you, I appreciate it. It was very helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What did he have to say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Sorry, I forgot. You were correct. It was not disappointment. He said something close enough to what you suggested he might say. Um . . . sort of, I guess I felt like you already knew. (Pause) It was good. He talked some about his own. So he has an eight month old son. His wife is a scientist. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">She\u2019s in the lab doing research on rats and he\u2019s at home taking care of their child and also writing. So he talked some about his own (pause) fears and concerns and thoughts and problems. It was good. So, I felt closer to him and supported in my . . . um . . . difficulties and struggles and doubts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: You look tired today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Do I?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Do you feel tired?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Not particularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">0:04:32<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Later I had a similar conversation with my friend, Franco, who lives here, who I see regularly. So I guess both of them I have leaned on in one way or another during Tanya\u2019s illness. They are the people who know what has gone on in the past and also they are the people who know me the best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: That was also good. That was also supportive. It was interesting. I felt like the conversation was harder from Franco than it was for Cody. I think that Franco had less a sense of like what he ought to say, or something, that seemed to cause him some mild distress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">0:05:49<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">0:06:46<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: We talked some yesterday about why I\u2019m curious about you and your pregnancy and I think that everything that we said yesterday was true. But I think there\u2019s also this . . . um . . . I want to know who you are and I want to know what your struggles and dreams are and, for me, in some sense your <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">pregnancy is an embodiment of those things or must be. How could it not be? It\u2019s sort of a sense that I have and as you suggested it\u2019s present. So it\u2019s sort of an accessible embodiment in some way. So I think that is an important piece of it also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">0:08:01<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: But I do also have a sense that the important question, I think that\u2019s an important question but I think that the other important question is why now rather than why at all. Because the why has always been true. I have always been curious about these things about you. And particularly more curious <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">now. I am just more willing to tell you. That is a scary process mostly because . . . um . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562604\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I think both because I am asking for intimacy and because I\u2019m telling you about who I am. I am the person who wonders these things and I am afraid that I will be known and not loved. So, it\u2019s just another form of loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Not loved because you want to know what it reveals about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">0:09:10<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: When you say that you are not going to be loved because if you share these things that it sort of speaks to something, that it reveals something about you that would be unlovable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Right, or repulsive to someone or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">0:09:39<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Another part of the fear of disappointment or loss is that I keep the things that are important to me close to me and hidden. The more important they are the closer that I keep them usually. Because if I don\u2019t they could be taken away. I don\u2019t have any particular theories as to why that exists. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">I imagine you\u2019re interested in why that is the case, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">(Long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">0:12:07<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: So the deal I made with myself in asking you about the sex of your spouse was that I would tell you the following two facts with regards to the answer. It just hasn\u2019t gotten around to the natural break here so. . . These are things that I keep close for reasons that are not necessarily clear <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">but I feel that I am protecting somewhat. The first is that my mother hates people who are gay. I don\u2019t but my mother does. And the second is that I am attracted to petite women.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">0:13:24<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: And it seems like both of those are linked in some way. I kind of connect the dots, but not directly related.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: They are linked in the sense that I am reticent to say either of them. I am not sure they are linked, either of them, to each other or specifically to the questions that I have about you, although the first one is definitely related to talking about your sexual orientation, kind of protecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">you from my mother is one of the things that I am doing in that. Not that you necessarily need that but I am doing it anyway. And maybe I am protecting her from you also but my feeling is more of the former in this specific case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">0:14:44<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Why doesn\u2019t she like (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Um, she believes that it is a horrible sin that requires being possessed literally possessed by evil spirits. She hates evil spirits so naturally it follows that one should hate the people who are possessed by them. I don\u2019t that naturally follows at all. I don\u2019t actually think that\u2019s the correct <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">description of sexual orientation but . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, even if one were possessed by evil spirits, shouldn\u2019t you feel bad for them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">0:15:21<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: But this plays into a world view where a lot of . . . the things that happen to you are a result of your believing in choices. If bad things happen to you then it must be that because you opened yourself to them in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">0:15:45<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a pretty horrible world view, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Well there are no accidents or coincidences, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Right. You know bad things happening to you are not always your fault. They are some nebulous adversary trying to attack you, but opening yourself to being allowed to being attacked is . . . uh . . . a failure in some way that brings upon you consequences. Maybe this is more related <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200831\">to what we were talking about than I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562604\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: I was thinking. You know that book Why Bad Things Happen to Good People? I think it\u2019s a Jewish book, or like coming out of Judaism. But I guess your mother (inaudible) would be well they were probably not that good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: You know, she\u2019s not quite that cold blooded so I think she might say something more like they made a mistake, not that they were really good people. But yea, there\u2019s definitely, there\u2019s always sort of that undercurrent that they must not have been that good, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: The book title itself is a logical inconsistency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yea, again it feels a little bit like I\u2019m presenting it unfairly or uncharitably. Because there is also this deep sense in her and in my community that like there is something out there trying to do bad things to good people all the time. And, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">0:18:04<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: So I don\u2019t know. There is more nuance than I was giving you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: So if you had been married to a woman we probably would have had this conversation when I found that out. It seemed less important to have immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Why would it then be more likely?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: (Laughs) I don\u2019t know. I just had this sense that\u2019s how I would have felt more urgent in following through with my deal with myself to tell you that I had been containing. But it seems like it affects you less directly in this context, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">0:19:19<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve also been trying to let the conversations that we have go where they go. . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But you would have felt more conflicted if that were the case?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s tough . . . um . . . yea, I think so. I would have felt like it would have had a larger potential capacity to hurt you than otherwise. But by the time that I was willing to ask you the question, I was willing trust you to be okay with the conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: How would it hurt me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: That\u2019s an interesting question. My initial response was like . . . knowing that someone hates you for a thing about you, hurt you? But I actually don\u2019t know that I believe that. Because this is the thing with loss and disappointment. I didn\u2019t say this but like, small disappointments are not <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">a big deal. People that I don\u2019t know not liking me are not a big deal; it matters more and more that the thing matters to me. So if I flip some coins and they all come out to the opposite that I wanted them to be. You know, where a commitment to them coming up heads or tails, so it\u2019s a matter of . . <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A92\">. it really matters to me whether you like me or not. It matters to me whether my friend, Cody, is disappointed in me for my fears or doubts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: And somehow you\u2019re wondering whether it would matter to me how your mother might think of me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Well, so when we draw it out that way, no I don\u2019t really . . . no I think it seems like it\u2019s rather conflating it matters to me what my mother thinks and it matters to me what you think. So I think sort of, wires get crossed, or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">0:23:11<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: It was very comforting to me a few weeks ago when you asked if I wanted to meet with you more often again. I was sort of anxious about then I had these discussions in which I said that I loved you, I was anxious about the idea that might have been off-putting for you too much. I understand that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B31\">you don\u2019t want to ask every session if I want to meet with you more than that session. It makes sense. But it was nice that that was a thing that you suggested again.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562604\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">0:24:00<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Because it showed that what you said was not off-putting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Or negligibly so insufficiently to change your overall view, or willingness to help or concern for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: This has been a very difficult session for me. So I\u2019m very anxious, afraid right now and have been for most of the session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Do you know of what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yea, it\u2019s all about, like, I\u2019m telling you things that are deeply personal and I\u2019m afraid of your response, afraid of opening myself to you in that way. You know, sitting in this chair in the same way, telling you anyway but the feelings are still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Are there particular fears you have about how I\u2019ll respond to the things that you\u2019re saying or is it just more general than that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">0:26:01<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: It feels more general. Like I don\u2019t have any I\u2019m not afraid of any particular words you might say in response if that\u2019s the question you\u2019re asking. (Pause) It\u2019s quite a lot of fear though, surprisingly so. Well, it\u2019s some sort of reflecting on how much there is and that takes up most of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">space left I guess, the reflecting on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: So I have sort of internal ways of reassuring myself I think, facing fears, or whatever our word is. So I can sort of tell how much it is by how effective or ineffective some of those are, particularly like a fear about a particular thing. Eventually I find a thing that is effective against <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">it and then can, you know, if I\u2019m afraid of a thing that is unlikely to happen, knowledge of how likely it is to happen and the conditions under which it would happen is a way of dismissing or alleviating the fear. So in this particular context, I read your dissertation this weekend which was very interesting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF2\">It was also scary to read that at the beginning particularly. I almost didn\u2019t get through the title page. It was a tough need for love and in this context I think I was afraid what I would find contempt for my need for love in your writing which . . . and I was sure enough that that was not the case <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF3\">that I kept reading so if I did sit there and pause for a little while. And so that same certainty is not enough to put aside my fear here and having read your dissertation and knowing what that there is no contempt in there, there is only love in some sense. I\u2019m still afraid. That must mean it\u2019s quite <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF4\">a lot of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">0:29:09<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: What was it like reading it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: It was very interesting. I\u2019ve never read Freud. The passages you quote, some of them are rather unintelligible so I appreciated you recapping most of them. That was helpful. Teasing in and out of them was how it was for me. Obviously I\u2019m not at all read in your field. (Pause) It was interesting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">It was nice to know what you think. It was nice to have a different window into what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Was there a different \u2018why\u2019 perspective that you read?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: The biggest difference was in the context of talking about my feelings for you that were never talked about in the sense of not only is this common, it\u2019s expected or even necessary. It\u2019s the sense at least that I get of how you read Freud. Obviously it gives me another direct access to what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">you thought then or what you think now about the treatment context. But that was reassuring in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562604\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">0:31:05<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t think ultimately this is off-topic that it\u2019s not following exactly what you just said but I imagine your mother espouses a lot of views that you don\u2019t or at least you don\u2019t anymore. And I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard. It means that her opinion matters less to me, counts less, but all of her opinions countless to me in some sense. Like I have come to have enough skep\u2014, she\u2019s equally certain about almost everything and I know that some of the things that she believes are just wrong so that covers <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E11\">my belief in her other beliefs or views or feelings, so she\u2019s proud of me for finishing my degree but her pride in me matters less than it would have when I was younger. That\u2019s hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Did you once, or were you once more on the same page with her beliefs than you are now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yea, when I was young and didn\u2019t know any better. Yea, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Was it at a gradual process of coming to think differently?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">0:32:52<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Well there\u2019s the sharp shift when the sort of world view collapsed in some sense, but that\u2019s a particular moment in time. It\u2019s not like my beliefs changed radically overnight but my certainty in whether I could believe the things changed radically. Are you familiar with Kim (?) (inaudible) It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">more like that than any revolution in science has ever been. His theory is kind of crap for science but it\u2019s great for how things went. There were things that didn\u2019t fit in and then there was sort of this paradigm shift and then things that more and more fit in to living in a different world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Do you think your siblings went through similar processes or different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: So, my youngest brother was in some sense too young. He was like two or three when that happened, so he\u2019s only lived in the world after we were always a part of this thing. And now no longer were. Vivienne, my older sister I think has been undergoing, in some sense, a more natural shift like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">I feel like as people grow up they come to differ from their parents more and so I think that\u2019s definitely been the case for her. Both she and Jessica, my younger sister, had very fraught relationships with my mother when we were teenagers and those have sort of, those relationships have sort of healed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF2\">through their college years and then now through the post-college years. But definitely talking with both of my sisters I can sense that they don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything that my mother believes. But they, I think they are different from me in that they, . . . I feel like I have this thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF3\">where I tend to value strength and . . . (pause) . . . I don\u2019t have the right word or set of words. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t value people who are weak, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t rely on them, and so I feel like I have less clarity as to where my mother sits on the spectrum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">0:36:14<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: And consequently I sort of rely on her less than I might otherwise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: And you certainly feel that need, just not clear where to place it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry which need?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562604\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: That need to have someone that you can rely on and look up to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: Yes, absolutely. I\u2019m, you know, not that confused about replacing it. I place it in you but yea, I definitely feel that need. I also have this sense of that this relationship that we have is a particular kind and is by design in some sense bounded temporarily but that the purpose isn\u2019t to develop <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">a situation in which I am reliant on you and that the purpose is to develop a healthier existence for me. So, yea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">0:37:55<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: And that\u2019s one of the things that has been difficult in trying to figure out what I do next in my career. In some fields one doesn\u2019t do a post-doc (?), one just goes directly to being a factor. I feel more or less prepared to do that just fine, but that\u2019s not the way chemistry works when it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">to a post-doc (?). Which means that I have to enter into a relationship with someone that is essentially an adviser, an advisee relationship again, or enter a relationship without any sense of like whether I can actually trust them to carry out their end of that relationship. And actually with some <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201032\">certainty that I can\u2019t because that\u2019s the nature of the field, is that one funnels towards people who have less and less time and so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Has that made it difficult to apply?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. So my present response is to say well that\u2019s not a thing that I can determine by knowing any particular thing about them but it is something that I can closely determine by interacting with them directly, so I need to send out the applications and interview with the people who are interested <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201091\">in interviewing with me and make the best decision I can from that context because that\u2019s the closest to the information I need can gather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Is that the only path that you are going to be taking right now? Is that what you are going to be doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">0:40:04<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: If I can find another path that leads me where I want to go, then I will take that. But that\u2019s sort of prompts the question where do you want to go and I don\u2019t have a clear answer to that. Independence? I want to do work that I value and work with people that I value. But that\u2019s a really broad answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Like something like industry is not something that interests you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: No, well there\u2019s just not a lot of independence. I don\u2019t really value making more money for more corporations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: I imagine that you feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">0:42:22<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: Well I have left questions so we had yesterday so I\u2019m going to ask a couple of more. In some sense deeply free of the answers so that\u2019s the theme of the session. So the first is have you ever been suicidal? And the second is would you lie to me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Are those two related? (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: (Laughs) Not directly, they\u2019re related into particular fears or concerns or something. They\u2019re related in the sense that they\u2019re not related . . . they\u2019re not a sequential one, in some sense. I think in the context of talking about strength. One of the things about strength is that my ideal <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F1\">vision of strength is not like a god of some kind, like a person who has no weaknesses or flaws or troubles or struggles. It\u2019s a person who\u2019s human. Humans have problems and struggle with things, that\u2019s the whole point. So these are, I think those are particular things about which I don\u2019t know how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F2\">resolve my feelings about those.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562604\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">0:44:15<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">(Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: I have one more that I actually feel like I need you to answer which is are you done answering questions with me, or are we . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: No, not necessarily. I don\u2019t have any predetermined idea of what I will or won\u2019t answer or what might or might not be helpful. Sometimes your questions give me more pause and I don\u2019t know why. Maybe because I\u2019m more reluctant to answer them or maybe for something else. I don\u2019t think those <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201291\">last two questions give me pause because I\u2019m reluctant to answer them per say . . . they caught me as so interesting I\u2019m just thinking about it. And then to be honest, because I really don\u2019t like to lie at the very least, you have like a half a minute left so I really want to delve into both of those <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201292\">and realizing I don\u2019t exactly know how I\u2019m going to do that in basically zero time but I\u2019m very interested. And my question that followed was you know, I was thinking in my mind perhaps jokingly but you know so is the question would I lie about answering the question about being suicidal right. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201293\">how I thought about them. As have I ever been suicidal as they\u2019re related but yea. No I\u2019m not honestly done answering your questions. I want to harvest all of your questions but those are really gambling, I\u2019ve got a lot to harvest there if that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s an interesting word.
