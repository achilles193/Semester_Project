AUDIO FILE:<\/span><\/p>\n<hr data-id=\"P1-N20008\">\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000B\">BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D\">CLIENT: Seems like forever since I\u2019ve been in here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It\u2019s been one of those extrusions (ph) where I\u2019ve been pushed into the only way to win the game is by doing things that are impossible, if that makes sense. By doing things like you\u2019re sick but you can\u2019t really take another day off because you\u2019ve already took the day before off therefore you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">come to work. But you can\u2019t breathe and the customer\u2019s starting to get freaked out. So basically you need to figure out some way to make yourself able to be not healthy but not scary for long enough to make it through the day kind of things. And just dealing with a lot of pain and feeling really desperate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">What I feel so pressed is between what I need to do and what, the word want isn\u2019t even really the right word for it, what life is actually compelling me to do. It just really puts me in a bad situation. It it makes it so it\u2019s just hard to keep going. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes. I think because you got your financial realities on one side and your health on the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: And then there\u2019s the stress from life and work and things like that and guilt from that related stuff. My rheumatologists say more or less told me that no matter what I do that the obligations in my life will string me dry and so I need to stop feeling like I can be controlled by them. But at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">the same time it\u2019s really hard not to because one\u2019s my livelihood and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Wait -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Like basically he was talking about the fact that I had to reschedule a lot and she said the number one thing you need to figure out right now is how no matter what you do they will always find an emergency for you to have to be doing something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Referring to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Work or things like that. So you just need to learn to say no or else it\u2019s just going to [inaudible at 00:03:10] you. And she\u2019s right, she\u2019s absolutely right. So, this was actually also in reference to the fact that she feels as if [pause] if we\u2019re going to do it and try for being able to have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">kids right now but it has to be this year maybe, if it\u2019s possible at all. I didn\u2019t think it was my work doing that but there\u2019s always these things popping up and this and that and she says you\u2019ve got to just, this is the only year you\u2019ve got really. And I said wow that\u2019s really f***king poignant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">Apparently something I did not know is that in my forties due to the drop in estrogen my, in general there\u2019s a lot of other, the disease is not more severe but it does tend to have, the symptoms tend to worsen. So if I was trying to bank on going another year or two, she said every [inaudible at 00:04:36] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">you have is just going to hurt because you\u2019re not going to have enough estrogen and this and that. And I said why didn\u2019t anyone tell me this? And she said I\u2019m telling you this now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: How old are you now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Thirty-eight. So, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s been on my mind. I brought it up anyways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: You mean having kids? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yes, if it was even advisable because 10 years ago they said no. Five years ago they said I guess you do have [inaudible at 00:05:17] will but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. She thinks that if I\u2019m going to decide whether or not I can it\u2019s completely out of her control. She will put me with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">a reproductive endocrinologist but this is probably the last chance I got. So, you know. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562060\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">It is also just from the point of view of knowing you\u2019re just having kids somewhat depressing to realize that the general malaise will probably increase in my 40s, so that\u2019s something I didn\u2019t realize. Not the actual this joint is going to hurt more or anything like that but the overall ability to, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">they often describe it the overall feeling is feeling a little bit like the flu all the time. That does increase. Basically that whole periomenopausal period of time is a strong time that it\u2019s formed, that kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">So there\u2019s a sense of dread for that. I don\u2019t know. I just feel like I\u2019m constantly behind on everything. [Pause] But I guess just keep going forward I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Are you wanting my advice a bit or ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: I I mean if there\u2019s advice to be had sure, but I just don\u2019t really even at this point, I\u2019m just resigned that there\u2019s isn\u2019t any advice at this point but if there is some I\u2019d be grateful. But now, just <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: My impression is also that the thought of trying to have kids and thought of not having kids are both overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. [Pause] I guess the thing is that the life that I want is not impossible but it\u2019s going to take more than just a little hope (ph) and hard work to get there. Like a lot of coincidences, a lot of luck, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. [Pause] At the same time, though, it\u2019s [pause] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">it\u2019s hard to imagine a life without that kind of hope, you know? Basically I\u2019m [handing out] (ph) dreams what the f**k do you do with the rest of your life? What do you got motivating you? Just <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Well it would involve tremendous grief. I guess it would probably be the biggest loss you ever had. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Yes. [Pause] It\u2019s just really hard because it\u2019s just, [pause] when you spend your entire life at playing it safe and doing things the right way and then realize that you sort of don\u2019t really have a whole lot to aspire to, it\u2019s kind of rough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Absolutely. Incredibly hard<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s just [pause] it\u2019s hard being so tired all the time. It\u2019s hard, really hard also on some level to constantly have to be able to be what other people expect you to be even if you fail [inaudible at 00:13:52] miserably. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yes, I imagine people expect things from you like that you\u2019re not in so much pain that you can be very focused for long periods of time or that you\u2019re not so worn out and exhausted that you have energy to deal with lots of things in a row. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes, or on some level that you just [inaudible at 00:14:17] sickness, if not able to hide it because it\u2019s kind of a downer. [Pause] No matter how, I don\u2019t know, just like I said, just [pause] no matter how much I think I guess I just seem like a miserable human being to other people, I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">on some level they don\u2019t realize how much I really hide and actually pretend to be a lot more cheerful and a lot more whatever than I really am. Like yes, I had to bargain my way into getting my butt into the store this morning or I slept 15 hours to be able to get to do this. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562060\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: They really just see, I mean it\u2019s not really respectful but I think it works like the tip of the iceberg of what you have to deal with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Yes, and all the stuff that I do mostly is, the only thing I actually really do disclose or either out of awkwardness or I don\u2019t know because I feel like I have to at some point or another. I feel compelled to lie a lot. I don\u2019t because it\u2019s just too complicated but I feel like I want to. [Pause] <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">I think I just come up with some watertight story that I can just be able to explain forward like why this or that. It\u2019s so much easier.  [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">I\u2019m sick of getting infections. I\u2019m sick of being in chronic pain. [Pause] If anything the one really good thing about this whole idea of being able to start a family is just that it has really gotten me, my husband to be a lot more mindful about his addiction at the very least. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s easier <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">for him to control because it\u2019s not the same thing. I think the point is, is that I think he\u2019s starting to realize that before things happened that he should pause and think possibly and maybe stop something. That\u2019s not the same thing as controlling but just I think good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">I know that this is just in general a really hard time of year for both of us. It really is. It\u2019s much harder than at Christmas. People were saying oh Christmas has got to be the worst. I mean it\u2019s a little bit sad, yes, and it\u2019s all but really January and February is the worst for us. Why because he <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">gets so depressed. I have memories, and this was many years ago, but he would get freaking catatonic, like stare at the wall and I could come back and he hasn\u2019t moved at all kind of depressed. He\u2019s not as bad as that but it\u2019s really bad, it gets really bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">And on top of it I feel like crap anyways so I\u2019m not exactly moving around so I need to be cared for a little bit. And to some extent it\u2019s 30% good for him because then he snaps out of his own world to help me but then it\u2019s also because I\u2019m not moving around and we\u2019re not getting things done that things <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">get it\u2019s just a terrible, terrible time right now for us. It always has been. And, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: What are your thoughts about starting a family? Where are you at in thinking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well because of the fact that my doctor said that it would be almost impossible to get an appointment unless we found, this year for me, unless we got, unless I got, an appointment was cancelled. I actually have an appointment next month from somebody who cancelled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: With the reproductive endocrinologist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. So at the very least it\u2019s an information finding thing. I know that this is going to be planned a lot. I am terrified about what, basically I was talking about this so much today with her just the whole concept of between supposedly if I can stay pregnant how much the symptoms get better. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">But getting to that part after the first trimester even at all is to me just terrifying because it\u2019s going to be painful. It\u2019s going to be painful a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">And I did not realize this. I thought I was going to go off everything. I\u2019m not going off everything. I\u2019m still staying with injections; in fact I get more injections. So it\u2019s going to be a couple of injections a day and I\u2019m just, I just got past the point last year where I was just I get needle-phobic <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">every so often. I don\u2019t really [inaudible at 00:23:02] the word phobia. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s almost like I can take it, I can take it, I can take, and then no, no, no I can\u2019t deal with this any more for a while. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20054-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20054-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562060\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">It\u2019s not the needles themselves; it\u2019s everything else related to it. It\u2019s the scheduling, it\u2019s the managing of where the injection starts are, it\u2019s the itchiness of the injections and reactions. It\u2019s not like the I\u2019m-afraid-of-something-piercing-my-skin kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like the I-can\u2019t-deal-with-one-f****king-more-thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes. And knowing that I\u2019m going to, not only that the stay on antidepressants actually apparently I did not know this but they got approval last year to start using on people who have [inaudible at 00:24:04] miscarriages the kind of stuff I take but in different dosage with different ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">of doing it such to because the kind of miscarriages I\u2019ve had and the ones that generally are really common for certain situations are due to we don\u2019t know why your immune system just kills. Anything before eight weeks that doesn\u2019t look like anything else that ought, anything else that physically, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">option is that. So they break it up into a lot smaller doses a lot more frequently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: How many miscarriages have you had?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Two. Well, two we think. This is one of those situations where because I was in my 20s, was married, and I did the whole oh hon, we\u2019ll send this stuff up for, we\u2019ll send we don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, it seems like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, blah, blah, blah, we\u2019re going to send this <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">all out and don\u2019t you worry about this. You got plenty of time kind of thing. Those are two that I it\u2019s hard to tell. Anything right around six weeks you don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yes, I understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">CLIENT: But [pause] the human whatever hormone whatever that they use for it has always been very, very low so it\u2019s never been really definitive but yet you bleed a lot but yet I\u2019m this is always the great thing of being the person who has the type of hemophilia that they\u2019re going to start giving <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">me Heparin (ph) shots twice a day. Why, because it\u2019s a completely different type of thing where the [inaudible] starts clotting and actually constructing the amniotic cord, which has nothing to do with my bleeding disorder but it just apparently it happens. I just don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">She was very, very positive about this whole thing. She seems to think that if we can get there things would be great. But it\u2019s going to be really, really crummy until then. And by really, really crummy it may never happen. I don\u2019t mean to seem, to make it seem like my life will be meaningless without <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">children but I\u2019m an only child. My parents had really limited lifespans and my spouse doesn\u2019t have, is basically estranged from his family and so we have as much family as we can create in our own way. I need something to focus on besides myself. And I\u2019m not meaning like on the level of oh my God I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">so obsessed with my children. It\u2019s like lives that <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: It seems often this pretty simple thing, which is you love kids and you want to have them.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562060\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I mean I know this stuff about family too but I think it\u2019s all true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yes. I feel like it would be a lot easier if I could just see something in my life that is bigger than me and my problems. [Pause] And knowing that the reality of adoption is probably not going to happen because just financially we\u2019ll never look like on paper what we need. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Not even if Mike gets a pretty good job?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Well, and even that\u2019s a am I going to hold out for that? Really? I think that it\u2019s better sometimes when the opportunity to step up thing. I mean tonight he\u2019s filling out applications for a thing over at a government agency, which would be good because we could be down in the Chicago area <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">where our friends are, our friends with kids are. But waiting for that I mean I\u2019ve been waiting for, I\u2019ve been hoping and waiting and trying to plot things out for so many years now that it\u2019s just not realistic. Due to a lot of reasons, some of them our own fault, some of them just faith, some of <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">them just malicious bitchiness we don\u2019t have the kind of resources that other people do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">And the best U.S. (ph) adoption is very resource weighted and foreign adoption unfortunately especially in China is drying up, so along with a lot of other things. Really, I had a huge window open to me realizing that I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m physically and emotionally prepared to open up that Pandora\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">Box. But also the weaving of the one-child policy thing starting up is going to change a lot. Plus a lot of countries don\u2019t like to lend the deadline to adopt to people over 40 if they don\u2019t already have children. So it\u2019s just, it\u2019s a lot, it\u2019s just lots at this point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">I\u2019ve had one doctor in my life who hugs me and tells me that let\u2019s do this together, let\u2019s try this. That\u2019s actually nice. It\u2019s been on my head, I\u2019ve been talking to her about it but it\u2019s not like she\u2019s, I wouldn\u2019t say, not influencing me but she has definitely turned her support on this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s somebody who\u2019s so hopeful I think and like she\u2019s in with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Yes, so she\u2019s been very supportive. She\u2019s made arrangements so that she\u2019ll see me in six weeks and she can have my spouse in. I\u2019m usually so awkward. Mike comes in with me to a lot of doctor\u2019s appointments. I go in with a lot of [inaudible at 00:31:00] usually because one of us is, the person <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">who\u2019s the patient, is so distracted by the ailment the other person doesn\u2019t remember shit coming out of it. It\u2019s normal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">She\u2019s the only one in the world who says totally why didn\u2019t he come in this time? Come on in next time, bring coffee, we are going to chat. There\u2019ll be exams but let\u2019s talk. That was really nice. Bring coffee. She\u2019s coming in on her day off. Not day off but her she\u2019s coming in before she does surgical <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">rotations or something like that so that she can see me in six weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Very nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yes. So, because she, we talked about this the fact that things just sort of pass and they just pass and they just pass and I wouldn\u2019t have gotten in with this doctor down south except they were booking for consultations for 2015. 2015 and not like January 2015, like April. So she said okay <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F1\">so let me talk to this person\u2019s secretary, and let me talk to this person\u2019s secretary and she said okay so I need to get this person on the list for when somebody cancels an appointment blah, blah, blah, and this and that. And after she made a lot of phone calls I have an appointment next month, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F2\">is not normal. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562060\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Yes, and she said, she sort of told me I\u2019ve had to lie to get to this point. She didn\u2019t really say it that way but she said yes, we\u2019re just going to call your previous history of miscarriages what\u2019s happening. Not we\u2019re not going to tell them what happened right now but we\u2019re going to use <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200831\">that as the reference information to get you in right now because they\u2019ll make you try for at least six months before you can try and book an appointment which will put you at least a year and a quarter away. So, and it\u2019s true. She\u2019s right, she\u2019s absolutely right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">It would be very easy to let the system cheat me out of this situation and she said you can make the decision not to do this but don\u2019t let scheduling and other things cheat you out of it should not be the logistics that keeps this away from you. And so, and it\u2019s very easy like that. I mean so many <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200851\">of my specialist\u2019s appointments, I make appointments with them and they say yes so I\u2019m going to see you later this year or something like that. But by then it\u2019s at the same problem. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s so unrelevant. It\u2019s so frustrating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">It\u2019s weird to have a doctor that has really not so much to do with what I\u2019m doing right now actually really doing something to help out. I mean it\u2019s something like that because it\u2019s the primary doctor that\u2019s going to have to alter my medication so that I can be this way. But it\u2019s also the primary doctor <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">that can actually vouch for me to see that I have had eleven injections and therefore I can kind of be compliant enough because if it had just been a regular couple at this point were being handed several boxes of needles and they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to say that they were in this situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">to be able to be compliant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">So, I don\u2019t know. I just on some level at the back of my head I just feel like I have to do this. I feel like it is the most irresponsible thing I\u2019ve ever done but I feel like if I don\u2019t try then I\u2019m going to always regret it. I mean really irresponsible. I have, we have nowhere to put a crib but <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200891\">I figure at that point, at the point in which we really ought to think about having a crib we\u2019ll have at least six months to figure that part out. You know what I mean? There\u2019s nothing, nothing but I feel like at least if I did something, get myself in a better place for this maybe I can be, say (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200892\">that I tried. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">For me the act of trying to do something is so important. Whenever I be a passive and just let the world happen to me life sucks and it sucks a lot. [Pause] If we go through with this I need to also make sure that we\u2019re both, right now we\u2019re both on the same page about making sure that Mike\u2019s family <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">will have no contact with our children. I need to make sure that never, ever gets breached. We have friends who have done this with other family members too successfully and have successfully been able to talk to their children about this too. And I feel like I need to make sure that this just, we don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B2\">ever give in on this one because this is this is not like the oh our dog will never sleep in the bed but now that our dog is 12 she sleeps in the bed kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562060\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">I need to make sure that they don\u2019t ever f***k up our children\u2019s lives because they, [pause] because everything they\u2019ve done has been so pernicious in our lives. Everything, everything. Nothing is good; nothing is safe. And I hate to be like everything has to be all or nothing or this or that, but I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D1\">think that the only way that I can get to the point of forgiving them is by forgiving them in a way that they have no relationship with me whatsoever. Mike\u2019s therapist has just wrote a big article about this and has been [inaudible] talking to Mike about the idea of forgiveness of his parents, his mother <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D2\">for the crap that she did to him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">Not necessarily that this has to be done now or anything like that but it has to have that open in his mind. I don\u2019t really, I\u2019m getting this third party, third party through somebody who\u2019s depressed and isn\u2019t necessarily relating things exactly right. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that she\u2019s coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F1\">to Christmas dinner, which is perfectly good with me. But to be honest [pause] I think that making sure that there is nothing else, I mean would be the greatest. I don\u2019t even want her to know about the existence of children, ages of children, anything like that. Which I mean I know I can\u2019t really prevent <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F2\">that. I\u2019m not going to be hyper vigilant in making sure that our children physically are not, never know, knowing about on the Internet or something like that or something, but I need to make sure that through regular channels <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: It shouldn\u2019t be that hard. She never pays attention anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes, it really, it really shouldn\u2019t be that hard. But the point though is making sure that the few people who are vaguely related to us know that they <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: that it\u2019s very important not to mention like Mike\u2019s Uncle Leonard, who is Mike\u2019s grandfather\u2019s brother. He\u2019s the only member of the family that likes us on his side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: And who\u2019s going to the Christmas party.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yes, back in Cincinnati. He knows my dad because they\u2019re both attorneys and they\u2019re from that, that get the age of this. Yes, so really different. Also reminds you oldest and youngest of nine children so I mean they might as well also come from different families because of that dynamic of being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">that far away. Just making sure that he understands that this is I mean I think he will but when he finds out that this is not something to pass onto Nadine ever because she\u2019s evil. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">I don\u2019t feel comfortable saying it that way because it sounds so ridiculously reductionist. It\u2019s bizarre but she said some pretty horrible things. Things that I don\u2019t want to have my children to ever have to have happen to them. And I think the only way I\u2019m ever going to have to feel comfortable and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D1\">not feel hyper vigilant, like oh my God I need to make sure that these kids never get [inaudible at 00:40:27] by them, is by making sure that they\u2019re never around, ever. So because I just, I have so much firm beliefs about things. Especially if our kids are related like Mike and I are. We\u2019re way to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D2\">oversensitive to that kind of bulls***t. I just won\u2019t try if you got this kind of crap out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562060\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F\">Mike says he has, he has no memory of childhood but he has memories of childhood of being able to figure out things that people, adults, did not realize that you knew what was going on kind of stuff. [Pause] I think if either they will or they won\u2019t be like that but I just, I know that I was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F1\">perceptive and how my kids could very well do that. Have I told you really quickly the story about the Santa Claus thing? So at one point my dad was being really pithy with me, really pithy. Apparently I was two. For Santa Claus the story about they say it was the night before Christmas thing and Santa <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F2\">Claus turned with a jerk, apparently he made some sort of an extremely off the cuff comment about the turning with a jerk was my Aunt Iris and jerk, like jerk as in not the action but the person. Completely sidelined, to me at all but making a joke about something because he\u2019s reading it at a party <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2009F3\">kind of thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Sort of a grown up aside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes, like a grown up aside kind of thing. I remembered that. I remembered that and repeated it back because my Aunt Iris was the helper of Santa Claus. And I still mention this every Christmas. He gets really embarrassed by it but I do it to remind him of the fact that certain, like the concept <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A31\">of the two, the dual nature of words and children they pick up on this stuff kind of thing. That\u2019s the kind of stuff that how early on I picked up and remembered, not strong memories, but that\u2019s the kind of stuff, the kind of grown-up aside and making a joke a kid remembers it. I didn\u2019t understand that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A32\">that meant that my dad was really angry at my Aunt Iris who\u2019s now passed away but it was really irresponsible and young and late teenager at the time was that kind of thing. But all I did was pick it up and I remembered it. Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">I can\u2019t imagine that it is impossible that others, anybody who\u2019s genetically related to me wouldn\u2019t necessarily I don\u2019t think they will but there\u2019s a good chance. I don\u2019t want them to have any off-the-cuff comments about this kind of crap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">THERAPIST: We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">CLIENT: That sounds good. Next week, I need to figure out timing. There is a chance that I may need to reschedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">CLIENT: Let me take a look here real quick. I have to take the dog for a consult with the dentist. I know. This is another reason why I\u2019m broke because I\u2019m taking care of things like dog dental bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I got you. Let\u2019s see. I can meet on Thursday at 3:45 if that works better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">CLIENT: Let me see about that. Normally I\u2019d say sure but now that I have a billion doctors\u2019 appointments I need to look. That\u2019s Thursday the 23rd?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">CLIENT: Actually I think that\u2019s much better.
