We won\u2019t actually be\u2014I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">if there was any week that would probably be the time that I\u2019d be\u2014it\u2019ll be like during the reading period probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Okay.

How does that seem to you that her being away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: I\u2019m happy for her. I\u2019m really happy for her. (pause) She works hard, you know? (pause) I often wish she had the opportunity to do more stuff like that. You know what I mean? So, it\u2019s kind of weird saying it. But like I feel like sometimes because I\u2019m in school and\u2014it maybe makes me unable and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">by extension her kind of unable to do more kind of stuff like that too. You know what I mean? So, it makes me happy that she\u2019s doing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s getting out and doing that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean she works a lot, you know? She just kind of goes to work and comes home. She doesn\u2019t get a lot of time to do things for herself. And it makes me genuinely happy. Like there\u2019s no jealousy or anything like\u2014I\u2019m just genuinely happy that she\u2019s going to get to do something fun. And I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">also happy that she\u2019s not going to be around while I have to do my studying because it\u2019ll just make things easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah.

And it seems to like some of the stuff we\u2019ve been talking about with like how you being in school and like how\u2014you know, how intense an experience it can be and then how it can lead to, like, the occasional feeling like, \u201cGod, I need to be\u2014I need to\u2014it\u2019d be great to have some <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">alone time.\u201d But wondering about this, like, kind of this psychic hops, like, it takes on her. On, you know\u2014what\u2019s it doing to Laney? What\u2019s it doing to Laney to be in a relationship with a guy who\u2019s in school occupied with stuff? And occasionally wants to have time to himself to\u2014you know, or might <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D2\">want or might need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: There\u2019s not even enough time for myself. I guess when I hear it that it doesn\u2019t even\u2014I mean it\u2019s just kind of school. I mean (crosstalk 00:05:30). I don\u2019t know. I guess when I just hear it that way. Like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Don\u2019t cast me as that guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So, that\u2014there\u2019ll be a bit of a relief in terms of the tension. It will be nice. That will be nice. It\u2019s her birthday. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just thought of that.

So, she\u2019s going to\u2014she\u2019s going to go stay with her. She\u2019ll have someone in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">city who speaks French and a place to stay for free, so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

(pause) Yeah. And I\u2019ll be doing finals. Just eager to get done with them. I don\u2019t feel that nervous about them. I feel a little nervous about them. Not really that nervous I don\u2019t think. I was thinking about it on the way here. I guess\u2014because I having this\u2014it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">just kind of popped into my head randomly. But I was speaking with Kaley (ph) a week or two ago and we hadn\u2019t had a lot of opportunities to kind of just talk about stuff since I got into school. I was just telling her about it.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">And I\u2019m trying to remember the way that I put it to her because it kind of\u2014when I said it out loud, I kind of thought to myself, \u201cOh, wow. I never really thought of it that way.\u201d But yeah. I told her I had really good professors. I think they\u2019re all really great. I\u2019m not close with any of them. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">have a close relationship with any of them. And, okay. I remember now. We were talking about the\u2014just the adjustment. You know, like\u2014that I felt like I was kind of in a bit more of a flow or a bit more comfortable in school. And initially there was kind of some stuff that I had to try to get used to. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200752\">And one of the things was, like, talking about my relationships with my professors that I was very used to the fact that when I was in undergrad I was very close with my professors. That was a huge part of the experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563467\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">And try to get used to that in school. And that\u2019s\u2014I think they\u2019re all very nice professors. They\u2019re very nice people, but I\u2019m not very close with any of them. And that was a little bit difficult at first, but I\u2019m kind of more comfortable with that now. And I think I also explained to her that I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">feel a need for them to want to really, really, really like me. On the one hand. And I\u2019ve also kind of come to the conclusion that I don\u2019t really even know that I would want a close relationship with some of them, you know. I don\u2019t even know that I would want to become close with any of them. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200772\">It seemed like kind of a big deal when I said it out loud. In my head, I was like, \u201cOh, wow. That\u2019s kind of interesting.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: What did you hear? Yeah. What did you hear in it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, I mean I guess I\u2014it just made me realize that I\u2014early in the semester I think I just kind of wanted\u2014early in my first semester I just wanted to have just kind of, like, a really close relationship with some of my professors even though I didn\u2019t really consider the fact that I don\u2019t really <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">think I particularly like some of them, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I got you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: And I was like, \u201cOh, man. (inaudible 00:10:16) just seemed kind of like really\u2014I guess I\u2019m just thinking about it, you know. When I can say that I\u2019m kind of relaxed going into finals. Just kind of thinking about just kind of the general kind of dynamics there and everything. I mean it just seemed <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">really interesting when I said it to Kaley (ph). It seemed that\u2014like the first time I\u2019d really considered it that way. I felt\u2014you know, there was something that I kind of stumbled upon, but I felt kind of good thinking that way. And on the way here, I was just kind of thinking about it again. Like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F2\">think that one of the things that I\u2019ve learned in school up to this point at least is\u2014not learn but I\u2019ve developed a (pause)\u2014an ability to just not really care what my professors think about me too much. You know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: No. I get the spirit of it. Yeah. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: I guess it just sounds so simple. But it\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: No. No. No. I mean\u2014well, what I sensed is that, like, that it was not just\u2014for you, I never got the impression that being liked by the\u2014carried the connotation of wanting to be\u2014wanting to have some state of, like\u2014that you were really\u2014you really enjoyed being\u2014because you enjoyed being liked <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">by them as much as it felt like a responsibility. Almost like I need this person to like me or I\u2019m not going to feel right about it, you know? As opposed to being like\u2014wanting to be the good\u2014a good student for its own sake or liked for its own sake. It had much more to do with something about I got <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">to be on the right side of this. I had the feeling at least that\u2014(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563467\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.

It had\u2014it sounds like it had more to do with (pause) something about being <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200891\">on the right side of things. Or\u2014well, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how you put it. (crosstalk 00:12:48).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really know how I would put it. I mean I guess it\u2014I think at the\u2014it might have just been (pause) feeling like I wasn\u2019t good\u2014almost more kind of like the\u2014I don\u2019t know if this makes sense. But (pause) maybe more like\u2014feeling like I wasn\u2019t in a position where I like didn\u2019t care if they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">liked me or not or something. It was almost more uncomfortable at that\u2014that way approach than the (inaudible 00:13:17). Yeah. I don\u2019t really know. But I mean, again, today I was thinking about it when I was coming here just because of my (inaudible 00:13:22) professor this semester is\u2014he\u2019s\u2014he can just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">be (chuckles) like a real hassle sometimes. And that\u2019s just the way he is. And he\u2019s not really unique by way of professors in that sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. They\u2019re not there for their sunny disposition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: No. I mean particularly this one. He\u2019s like on his last semester. He\u2019s about to retire. He\u2019s on his way out. He\u2019s (pause)\u2014yeah. He\u2019s not the most sensitive of professors. But (pause) I don\u2019t know. I guess it just kind of occurred to me when I was walking over here that (pause)\u2014I genuinely just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">really don\u2019t care I guess. Like particularly like my professor, I guess. Because like when I came into school and I was like trying to figure out like who was going to be like, you know, my Kaley (ph) here. Who\u2019s going to be like the professor that like, you know, I\u2014who is like my mentor? And that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F2\">can recreate that dynamic with. You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">Because it was just kind of what I do really well. I kind of thought about maybe my professor because that\u2019s what I want to do for work. I looked at his publications. He seems really interesting. He seems\u2014you know he has his history as a public defender. And I think overall he\u2019s a very kind of principled <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200911\">person. (pause) Initially, I thought that\u2019s kind of what I was hoping maybe would happen. But (pause) yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">I guess I don\u2019t really\u2014I just seem to have totally (pause) kind of just lost that feeling of urgency, you know? I (pause) just genuinely don\u2019t really care what he thinks about me, you know? (pause) Yeah. And I guess that just feels like a very different type of thing for me to do. You know what I mean? <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200931\">Just totally new to me, I guess, you know? It\u2019s (pause)\u2014yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Well, let\u2019s be\u2014is it a fairly\u2014do you notice it as a fairly large relief? Or is it not really like the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I\u2014yeah. I mean it\u2014yeah. Just to be clear. And all of this is I think\u2014yeah. I really believe in and feel really relaxing type of thing, you know. I think it (pause)\u2014yeah. I think it contributes to maybe me being kind of surprisingly relaxed like going into something like finals. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200971\">know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That meaning of, like, finals like\u2014you know, I remember how much, you know, your final thesis for, you know, college was so\u2014it wasn\u2019t just the work you were working on. It was so much that it was intertwined with Kaley (ph). And, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563467\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Absolutely. And then that\u2019s exactly it. Like that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m kind of putting it up next to, you know? Because in a way like this is quantitatively and probably qualitatively a bit more demanding even. You know what I mean? It just seems odd to me that\u2014I guess you\u2019d think that corresponding <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">with it\u2014I would be even more kind of a nervous wreck going into it, you know? But I\u2019m not. And (pause) it seems kind of\u2014it seems like an obvious conclusion that it probably is something to do with that, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: That I don\u2019t really care. (pause) Yeah. It makes me feel more like a (pause)\u2014when I said it\u2014when I told Kaley (ph) that and I was kind of like surprised by the fact that I felt like that\u2019s kind of where I found myself now. The way she put it was (pause)\u2014she said she thought I was like coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">into myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: How did that sound? What did it sound like to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: (pause) I mean it\u2019s like the type of thing if anyone else said it to me it would have felt very paternalistic. But it didn\u2019t from Kaley (ph). Particularly because I think with Kaley I\u2019m still in that mindset. And like if she thinks I\u2019m going into myself then it\u2019s like really great. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A31\">what I mean? (laughter) (pause) But (pause) it made me feel good I think because it made me\u2014I said it out loud. I (pause) initially, what came to my mind was like exactly what I think always kind of worries about doing it. I guess just approaching things like that was\u2014if that meant\u2014like if that was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A32\">a bad thing to do. To not really care what people would\u2014you know? Like if that\u2019s just not\u2014if that\u2019s selfish or something. If that\u2019s not being considerate to not really care what people think about me. You know what I mean? It was interesting to hear her say that. I was like\u2014it was really reaffirming <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A33\">because I guess it was well timed in that sense, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: No. It\u2019s funny because as you\u2019ve been putting it (pause) there\u2019s like a\u2014the way you\u2019ve been talking about it is I don\u2019t care about what other people think. I was thinking that I was wondering how\u2014what the feeling behind it is too. That\u2019s to say that like I was wondering if there\u2019s almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">a way you talk about it as if you feel\u2014does it at all feel to you like that means you\u2019re being dismissive or something? Or in the sense oh I don\u2019t care what they think? You know how people have that kind of way of saying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. And, you know, saying it a loud and hearing it like I don\u2019t care what they think\u2014like I\u2014in a way I feel like that is totally the wrong way to put it or something which is something that comes to my mind. But yeah. It\u2019s like that approach in itself\u2014like what if I took that approach <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A71\">with Laney? That would be horrible. Like that would\u2014you\u2014how\u2014I couldn\u2019t take that\u2014you know what I mean? We couldn\u2019t be together if I didn\u2019t care what she\u2014you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s obviously complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: It\u2019s obviously not the right approach to take, you know, in situations like that, right? Like with your friends. Like you\u2019d never want to realize that that\u2019s actually like your (pause), you know\u2014your way of doing of things, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563467\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Like if I realized that a friend of mine actually didn\u2019t really care what I thought I would be, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d You know what I mean? \u201cWe\u2019re not as close as I thought.\u201d You know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. And exactly like it\u2019s called\u2014well, exactly what does that mean? Does that\u2014it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re sort of saying it carries a kind of a kind of a meaning of it meaning that it\u2019s very impersonal then if you don\u2019t care what they think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: It hurt\u2014it would be like hurtful. It would be\u2014you know what I mean? To someone that I\u2019m close with. And I mean I guess like in my mind, I guess I can sort of see maybe where my mind goes with it. Like it seems logical that that would be hurtful, you know, towards somebody else too. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B31\">what I mean? Or at least not\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. And then it can kind of feel like am I being\u2014you know, like does this mean I\u2019m dismissive? Does this mean I\u2019m\u2014it\u2019s an impersonal kind of not caring what they think? What does that stand for? What kind of attitude does that stand for? What\u2019s funny is that I didn\u2019t see\u2014at <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B51\">least with the school professors, I heard you saying it in the tone of like I don\u2019t care in my mind what they think of me in a particular way. I didn\u2019t hear it as like that means I don\u2019t care what their minds are like or what they\u2014if they have an impression of my work or not. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s\u2014in fact, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B52\">I imagine you do. Like there is still a part of you that goes, \u201cWell, I want to know what the grade is. These are the professors. I want to\u2014they might have something to say about my work.\u201d What I\u2019m sensing though, it\u2019s like it\u2019s not them kind of\u2014them being a voice in your head that\u2019s kind of like an <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B53\">important facet of why you\u2019re doing the work you\u2019re doing. I mean it\u2019s a hard way to\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean the way that it was with Kaley (ph), right? It was almost always this kind of like weird fusion between the two. You know what I mean? Where (pause) there was no kind of like real meaningful extension between the two of us. And then, yeah. Absolutely. In that sense. You know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">what? One difference definitely feels that I feel there is something beyond my experience with these professors. You know, what do I want to do which the idea of kind of like a stepping stone. They are not the\u2014they\u2019re not the end of the line here or something, you know. But I mean also\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: It was nothing. There was no other\u2014like the only thing I was ever trying to accomplish I felt like with my thesis was (pause) to write a thesis for my undergrad. I knew that that was like a really new thing for her. You know, that she did not have (inaudible) do that. And I wanted to be special <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">to her. I mean it was very evident to me. You know, like it wasn\u2019t to do it and then to use it as like a stepping stone to get to grad school. I mean there\u2019s no anything about that. You know what I mean? But I mean like the other thing too is like I felt like there was\u2014just that sense of doom of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB2\">failure that came. Like for some reason like in my mind, it was very evident to me that it was like\u2014there was like nothing worse in the world than not accomplishing that. Nothing. Like nothing was going to be worse. The sacrifice. You know what I mean? In my head, it seemed that kind of like important. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB3\">And that type of\u2014that\u2019s not the dynamic here, you know? (pause) Which obviously feels (chuckles) kind of nice, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563467\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You know that\u2014and one thing I\u2019m thinking, Geoffrey, is like how much\u2014God. You know your mother comes to mind to me in situations like this around your feelings of\u2014is she being\u2014how is she an issue being thought of enough? The kind of the carefulness with which you kind of really\u2014you\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD1\">taken with her and the\u2014in contrast with how you\u2014I think you saw your dad who seemed to quote\u2014you know, not going care what she thinks\u2014which led to all this kind of real\u2014a real sense of\u2014a real feeling of like hurt and almost in the description a sense of like a kind of psychological abandonment. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD2\">(pause), you know, so\u2014I mean just to say that all this stuff is so\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: I see that. You know, I see that distinction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s so complicated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: But in a way I feel like I am doing something akin to that approach (crosstalk 00:26:43) with my dad with my professors. And I guess the things that come to mind is like I know that could be hurtful in some situations. I think. (pause) I know I don\u2019t want to do that, but I\u2019m doing it. It actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C31\">feels kind of good which is a little like terrifying. And it\u2019s like\u2014let\u2019s assume then that there\u2019s that\u2014it actually can be something that isn\u2019t\u2014maybe it\u2019s not per se an evil thing to do. But how do you draw those lines? You know what I mean? How do I know? You never take it up with Kaley (ph) obviously, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C32\">you know. And I guess like when I said it out loud to her, I was like, \u201cOh, God. I hope,\u201d\u2014when I said it out loud, I was thinking in my head like, \u201cOh, wow. I feel like for a long time I actually didn\u2019t even want to let you know I was capable of not caring what professors thought of me,\u201d or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C33\">You know what I mean? So, I mean that\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s like\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: It must have been a relief then to hear her say you\u2019re coming into your own. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: In a way, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: As opposed to interpreting it along the lines of, \u201cWell, what does that mean?

I mean that\u2019s exactly why I feel like she made a comment about\u2014I was like\u2014it was actually really well timed because it\u2014like it immediately kind of reacted to what I think would have left me feeling really a little more comfortable afterwards. But (pause) yeah. No. I think that that has <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB1\">a lot to do with it, you know? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: It would be some\u2014me being careful with my mom? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Yeah.

I feel like (pause)\u2014I feel like they probably look at me the way that I look at my dad as not really\u2014you know caring about being connected with <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">them or something. Or, you know. I think it hurts my mom that I don\u2019t call my grandparents and stuff, you know?

No. And then the meaning around not calling your grandparents or something can have this kind of\u2014can lead to a kind of a construction of it or of the mean being, you know\u2014you\u2019re not doing what made people feel better or feel good. You\u2019re ignoring it or something like that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean and\u2014I\u2019m not (pause)\u2014I\u2019m not making decisions about how I relate with my family.

I don\u2019t really seem to know exactly maybe what it is that\u2019s driving that. Why I feel uncomfortable there? But I can you is it\u2019s not\u2014I\u2019m not making those decisions based upon like how does my mom feel? What would make her feel better?

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: That\u2019s abundantly evident to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Does it weigh on you in some way that you don\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Oh, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean I guess that\u2019s what I was getting at. I guess I was getting at that element of it that the effect\u2014you have to be\u2014I\u2014like the careful with your mother kind of thing it means that you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re thinking about the impact. You\u2014there\u2019s like both a caring what she\u2019s thinking and trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F91\">not to care what she thinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.

That\u2019s\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: That may be a better way to put it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: Cognizant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And it also seems to me like it\u2014and that it\u2019s also a bit (pause)\u2014almost like it\u2019s\u2014the way you described it you can feel quite oppressive. (pause) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean it\u2019s (pause)\u2014yeah. It\u2019s (pause)\u2014I\u2014yeah. It seems like there are a series of options there in terms of like (inaudible 00:34:10) with my mom and my family name and stuff. That I kind of like walked into and I\u2019ve been determined by other things. And I have very <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">little ability to kind of like actually (pause) determine.

That you\u2019re both, you know, feel like really (pause) constricted by, but also (pause)\u2014or constricted within\u2014restricted to. That kind of set of meanings about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. It\u2019s interesting, right? You know, I\u2019m just thinking about it. Like it\u2019s funny because what I was saying earlier was\u2014wow. Like it seems to me like the most kind of respectable, moral, genuine, nice, selfless way of doing things is just to be completely kind of\u2014is to be the most possible <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201131\">concerned with other people\u2019s feelings and to make your decisions based upon that. And, you know, the nasty people or the nicest people do that to the greatest extent possible or something. (pause) And I think that that is good. You know what I mean? And (pause)\u2014and I think about my mom. That\u2019s actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201132\">like that\u2019s precisely what frustrates me in a way. You know, the ability to be able to (pause)\u2014to be able to kind of like experience any of that stuff side of that kind of\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: Wait.

Anywhere you move is kind of pulling on something. You know what I mean? (pause) You know the inability to have any approach towards that. And that\u2019s\u2014yeah. It\u2019s oppressive. Yeah. You can just kind of\u2014it\u2019s like you can just throw the yoke off. There seems no other <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B1\">possibility there. (pause) So, I guess that would be one sphere of my life where I feel like I do do what I\u2019m doing with my professors. Insofar as I feel like I\u2019m perceived that way. You know what I mean? Like it\u2019s not the same area of relief or anything. But\u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Because what I\u2019m hearing about the school experience is that I don\u2019t hear you feeling very\u2014you know, like it feels like it\u2019s\u2014it means\u2014it\u2019s got that meaning of uh-uh. Well, I\u2019m just one of these people that don\u2019t care. It\u2019s more that it sounds to me like that\u2019s just something that you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D1\">free of worrying about. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. But I didn\u2019t get the impression that you felt kind of, you know, that there was an element or dimension of guilt associated with it. But\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s weird because that\u2019s\u2014I feel like that\u2019s the (pause)\u2014I feel like those are the like\u2014at least among my family name and stuff. Those are the dominant feelings. You know what I mean? Like that\u2019s (pause)\u2014those are the kind of key words that\u2014the buzz words so to speak.

And that there\u2019s a little\u2014it\u2019s almost like the impression I get is that you feel more freedom to <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201211\">have this be your work and your\u2014and it not be about (pause)\u2014not be an experience that has a lot of meaning around like well, how are people, you know\u2014how am I thought of?

And on some level it does matter what they think at least in as much as what the grades are or what\u2014how they see your work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2012B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Like that\u2019s what I was\u2014that\u2019s what I was going after with Kaley (ph), you know? I don\u2019t need them to love me.

That\u2019s a very relaxing set of dynamics. You can contrast that with like Kaley [ph]. You can contrast where we\u2019re talking about like with my family name. There seems a lot more room for (pause)\u2014yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20131\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. Right. Right. Yep. (pause) Yeah. And it can\u2014maybe one of the big contrasts now for you between school and like say your family or Laney for that matter or Kaley (ph) is the element of love. (chuckles) You know? If I love them, does that\u2014then, you know, is it necessary to be\u2014you <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201311\">know, thinking along those lines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20133\">CLIENT: Well, that seems to me the right avenue. That\u2019s enough. I mean it\u2019s like it probably almost seems more like who is it okay to not love? Not even come to love yet. You know what I mean? That seems to be more of like the question. At least when I think about it, you know? Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yep. Yeah.
