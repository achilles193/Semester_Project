(pause)  Yesterday I felt really badly that I wouldn\u2019t call you on my way to the hospital and I thought that you felt bad about it, too.

You, in part, imagined not getting those from me, and so did not want to call me, that being let\u2019s just say awful. Then the e-mail that you wrote last night. I had time to read it briefly, but I haven\u2019t spent a long <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">time looking at it and thinking about it.  But what I remember is that you did describe the state that you are in that you said can be very hard to remember and get at when you\u2019re not in it. I remember it was sort of raw and alone and awful.  I think what\u2019s coming out in here is I think you feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">I am keeping you at a great distance. I\u2019m not talking and I\u2019m not letting you talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And I can\u2019t focus on anything else.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I think this is one very important version of me that you contend with when you\u2019re not here.

(pause) That part comes from you and me.  (pause) When somebody wants to hear from you they make it clear. (pause) That\u2019s not true here. (pause)  So I don\u2019t know what to pay attention to. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: I expect you also feel pretty bitter, actually, and angry about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: How I felt yesterday? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: About my [putting] (ph?) you or leaving you unsure what to pay attention to.

It\u2019s like me being really still.  I don\u2019t understand why uncertainty about what we talked about together (sniffling) is [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:19). I guess I don\u2019t need to understand it, (sniffling) but I wonder if there is something else that I\u2019m missing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t understand it very well either. What seems pretty clear to me is that you kind of came to or stumbled into this very bad version of things between us and maybe part of it is that I didn\u2019t respond to correct that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Like yesterday morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Yes.

I had that feeling right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: I think another way to say the same thing was that you are very upset with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I was really worried about my feelings and maybe I was upset with you for not helping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I guess you felt really hurt, not necessarily mostly because I did anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right. There was that and there was also my reading of how you felt. That can get really bad because I don\u2019t really know how you felt.

(sniffling) It sounded like you were sort of trying to explain to me why I would call you and why someone would and maybe I took that to mean it. There is something very sad, Allison. There is something very wrong about what you\u2019re saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I was surprised we wound up where we did. I think what I had in mind was it seemed to me that you had assumed that I had gotten this call from someone in my family and had kind of set this up in your mind as being a little like being about me with work and me with my family and where are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">you?  That\u2019s kind of the ballpark I thought we were in, in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sniffling) I think we were there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: I guess where I was imagining we were going \u2013 I didn\u2019t have this as fully formed in my head or I would have just said it \u2013 was it kind of seemed conspicuous to me that you were sure the call was from a family member and that it was part of how you were imagining the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: I sort of made up a lot of stuff and I was really going with it. I didn\u2019t realize it until yesterday. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562302\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I guess I imagined there was more to learn about all of that, but which I didn\u2019t have, so I was saying, \u201cHuh, I\u2019m struck you kind of seemed as though I could [tell] (ph?) to have made these assumptions and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s up with that.\u201d And then we wound up somewhere else, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">I feel there is an important thread that I am missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: That we wound up somewhere else or that you don\u2019t know how we wound up somewhere else?  There\u2019s an extra-long pause there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: For me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m remembering a thought I had last week \u2013 which I think I said, but maybe I didn\u2019t say it \u2013 which was I\u2019m not yet sure how this relates to what we\u2019re talking about today, but I have a feeling that maybe it does. You may be doing this split where there is the person calling <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">me on the phone on the way to the hospital and there is me here talking with you and the way you were feeling.  You actually are strongly identified with both. Both are kind of [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:11) or more settled. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: You brought it up. (sniffling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Like \u2018Jay, I think it\u2019s important to me that if you need to leave, you know you can let me know and I will be okay.\u201d And then another version of you that was what you were feeling yesterday, which is more like on the way to the hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah.  And it\u2019s important that you go be with that person, but then it\u2019s also important because I\u2019m the same person that you be with the person who is going to stay. It\u2019s important that you stay and it\u2019s important that you go. (pause) (sniffling) I think I thought about what it would be like. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">It wasn\u2019t a prescient thought, but I didn\u2019t know how I was going to be feeling that night.  I think it really scared me that I . . . It\u2019s like we\u2019re building this whole thing and I still wouldn\u2019t want to talk to you because I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. And then where does that leave the on-the-way-to-the-hospital <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200692\">me? [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:44) (sniffling) Maybe because my impression of how you would act, which is also imaginary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Most importantly, not close enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right. It\u2019s sort of like I\u2019m on the way to the hospital and Jay isn\u2019t there because I haven\u2019t asked him to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: In being on the way to the hospital, you\u2019re not on the way here. I think, the way you\u2019re talking about it, part of what needs to be on the way to the hospital is that we have not been able to contain whatever it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes, and that was really disturbing; but that is true and could be true for another patient.  I don\u2019t know why that can\u2019t just be something that comes up and then sort of stays where it is, which is with another person\u2019s life, not with my life. But it didn\u2019t. It was like I was so much comparing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">and comparing is so corrosive and dangerous and never-ending. It\u2019s like maybe what we have is really special. Maybe somebody else needs you way more than I do and I shouldn\u2019t be taking up so much of your time.  Maybe you\u2019re not the greatest thing ever for other people. Maybe you are the greatest thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200712\">and they still go to the hospital. All of these things are bad or very good. It\u2019s like the fantasy is true or it\u2019s not true, and both are really intense and hard to see.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562302\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: We should stop.
