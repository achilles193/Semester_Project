It's a thank-you note.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Oh. I don't know whether to say thank you or you're welcome for a thank-you note, but I'll read it and then answer. That's great. (pause) Um... Well... I will say both then. You're very welcome and thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: You're welcome. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: And... I feel very fortunate to know you as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (pause) We're coming up on one year, which means... I don't know why it's more embarrassingly late to print out a thank-you note after a year, but somehow it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: We spent a bunch of time carving the linocut (therapist affirms) of that and printing it by hand...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Wow!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: ...but not one year. I spent like, three months doing that. (therapist affirms) This is a thank-you note that felt really important to me... (pause) not that... like, talking about my wedding feels like a central part of this, necessarily, but this feels like a central part of that chapter which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">is ending. It feels like it's ending with the end of the thank-you notes. (therapist affirms) (pause) So hence the timing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">[pause 00:02:35 to 00:02:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I'm thinking about how we feel fortunate to know each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">[pause 00:03:00 to 00:03:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">It's just hard to let that just be the way it is... really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: (pause) What are you finding yourself wanting to do with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Uh... (pause) I think I want to hug you... and... you know, I think want more from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">[00:04:32 to 00:04:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I don't know if I should (inaudible) it's almost like a disappointment and it's like an appetizer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: (pause) Writing poems (ph) (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">[pause 00:05:12 to 00:05:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">Have you been to Italy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: (pause) Not yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: You should go sometime. I don't know when you would go. (pause) Like, would you go alone? Would you take your family? Would you go soon? (pause) These are the sorts of things I wonder about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">[pause 00:06:23 to 00:07:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I guess I imagine that the tension there is between like... wanting to be like, a good dad and a good family guy, and also... the sort of various ways there being without you (ph). (client affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Well, I think there is also the third thing, which is being there for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: (pause) You being there for...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: You being in Italy for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: (pause) Like before you knew me or impacted (ph) me... but also for me and with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">(pause) I think taking your kids to Italy is a great thing to do. So, it's not so much like, you would not take your kid , you would like, not go now because... it's not good to take your... it's not a good \"dad thing\" to do, to take your kids to Italy. I just wonder... wonder about your values and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200571\">what goes into parenting decisions like that. (pause) Not just parenting. This isn't like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: (pause) I didn't get the last part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Well like, do you value your children seeing that there are other parts of the world? What do you want to do with your money? What season would you go in? Where would you go? What sorts of things would you see?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: (pause) What should I see? (pause) I mean...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559861\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Um...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: I would see in a way what I want, I guess (ph) right now is part of what you mean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I don't know you well enough. (pause) I think you should, I think... Okay, from what I do know and feel... um... textiles and architecture (therapist affirms); but actually, I think it's the sort of place where you should just like, get off the plane and that's all you need to do to see (therapist <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">affirms) what's there. It really brings itself to you, there is no avoiding it. (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">Like... depending on what part of the country, you like, leave the airport and there is like, ten people trying to give you a ride, it's like, four children grabbing onto your clothes. There is... you know, coconut... coconut and coconut juice peddler like, a cell-phone guy, a tobacco guy, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">get your like, high-school diploma, get your college diploma, learn English... trucks, cows, rickshaws, cars, bicycles, motor scooters, dust, urine, feces and diesel... food, all of those smells. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">(pause) I've only ever been there in the summer, so the heat has a pretty strong (therapist affirms) association with it, with the heat. (pause) There is little time... Taking care of one's body and paying attention to one's mind that is so strongly like, a part of people's lives there, you know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">is taught in schools, but isn't in the news and... (ph). (therapist affirms) You know, my dad and my grandfather, I mean, I don't know what happens now, in the cities especially. It's a lot more like western countries, but when my dad and grandfather were there... they did like, daily yoga. Yoga in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200672\">Italy, at least the old Italy, is largely a spiritual and meditative practice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I see. It's not like going to kind of yoga classes around here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: No. Like meditation through movement and prayer for (inaudible). But there is also this just like, really strong value of healing and... And then there is like, so many whacked-out people like, pretending to be, or seriously being like, swamis and aesthetics and Brahmans. They all have their <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B1\">like, \"thing\" that they promise you, or that they do. They do incredible things with their body and their mind. There's a big tradition of like, finding your teacher, especially in the more like, religious areas of the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">[pause 00:14:23 to 00:15:44]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: There is too much \"trying\" going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Huh. Like, from both of us?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. And what you said at the end of yesterday's session, about what's hard for you. Like, keeping in mind what's central while staying involved. Uh... Yeah, I think you don't have to do that as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Oh, really? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I... I think it comes... I think what's central comes. I think it hides some things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: (pause) You mean like, my being \"in role\" hides some things, or makes it more difficult to get at some things that are sort of central?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: (sighs) Well, it just, it makes it harder to explore... everything. (pause) Lots of things get dropped, and lots of things get picked up, and it's not clear why, except that like, you're thinking really hard about what you think is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (pause) Sometimes. I don't feel like I always, it feels like I'm always thinking real hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559861\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. Whenever it feels like, anything always is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: (pause) I guess that's a little like you're saying, you know, \"Jay, get the hell out of your head and come like, be here with me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I think you are here with me. (pause) But... (pause) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: It just feels like kind of. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: You are here with me. It would just be nice if you... a, a conversation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I know. (pause) I know. I understand. I think that's central, and I think it is a big deal, and I... kind of can't. (pause) I mean, I don't want to... (inaudible) enjoy that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">[pause 00:19:53 to 00:20:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">This is like another version of the thing I think you told me a couple of weeks ago I should explain every time. (pause) It turns this into something else. And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">[pause 00:20:40 to 00:21:29]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">You know, in perhaps the same way and perhaps in different ways, I guess, depending on the conversations, that, you know... talking about (inaudible) find attractive, you know, make this a different thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">[pause 00:21:48 to 00:23:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">And I think, um... I mean, obviously, I don't want to come across as being too uptight about, you know, this being like, terrible, sort of talking to you freely or I'm like, always like, entirely 100% focused on, you know like, whatever is therapeutic in that millisecond, but... I think, you know, there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200971\">is also...an aspect of it that's like... I want to say like, it just gets in the way of your being able to have what you feel here, if it's going to affect me in a way that changes what we're doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">(pause) That actually means that there are ways you can do other things that you want me to do, or ways you want them to be that... like... you can't just have as such, but that sort of... you know like, that I'm going to turn this into something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">[pause 00:25:08 to 00:25:45]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">I guess to my mind, it's important for you to be able to... whatever it is, can talk about whatever you want to talk about.

(therapist affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah, I don't, I don't... I don't have it (ph) worked out, but I think you kind of need to be... with people you're close to... and who are close to you, somewhat inside the other person, in order to feel at ease... um... oriented, maybe. At ease, definitely; oriented, I'm not sure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B51\">But the other piece of it is... that, I think limit (ph) sort of puts constraints on what you can feel.

I think this may be part of why like, separation from say, your family like, when you leave their house, your parents' house. It's difficult, because you know them in the same way.

(therapist affirms) (pause) Yeah. (sighs) The only thing that really makes the separate, all of the different separations feel better is like, getting distracted. (therapist responds) It's not like, better... or like, you know, latching <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB1\">to something else like (therapist responds), arriving at my home here and feeling... like, grounded for other reasons, but it's not like I ever feel like I'm inside... the people I'm leaving, in any other way, other than like when I'm (inaudible).

(inaudible) like any of them, but... (client affirms) So... There is a lot of controversy about the whole system (inaudible). (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">CLIENT: Hmm.

(sighs) the sort of... oligarchic nature of the training analyst system. Basically... I just don't know a lot about it. But... it really kind of is sort of... special seal of approval to a small number of the faculty of analytic <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200F11\">institutes and... and then, maybe kind of likely decide, who else could come onboard or not and so, I think questions of like, politics and popularity (client affirms) enter into it and... that's one problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559861\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">Another is... more for the candidate, but like, you know, the question is... are those people going to do a better job, thinking who should analyze candidates or are the candidates themselves going to do a better job? If the candidate can just go do analysis with whoever they want, more of less (client <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F31\">affirms), you know... Like, (inaudible), you know, some people would argue that seems much more reasonable than, you know, having a community (ph) of training analysts decide who else they're going to let into the club and allow to (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: And candidates have to choose from those people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Right, exactly.

Like... in a theoretical sense, I could see it, you know, just see the model and I don't, kind of involved enough with that kind of stuff really to know in practice (inaudible) how it works like, how much (inaudible) there is versus you know, how much they're really <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB1\">faculty who (inaudible) (client responds), you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: (inaudible) super-duper (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(therapist affirms) So like... you're selecting for things that aren't necessarily...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: ...the most important thing (therapist affirms) for the candidate, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I think that definitely happens.

I mean, some of them definitely sort of drift into (ph) to the club.

(pause) It's a hard thing to have in life... and not be able to... Well, maybe this is a result of how I relate to people, not, like not be able to feel like other people can really, really know what I'm talking about and what I'm (inaudible). (therapist affirms) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">THERAPIST: (affirms) (pause) Yeah, Freud said that... there is no model for the analytic relationship anywhere else in life.

Well, maybe it's not true. Are there more, is there more of a population in an office now than, say... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Probably not, no. Probably, the period from like... like in the 60s and 70s, with analysis was in sort of a hey day or like golden day to the U.S., but also really hasn't sort of died out or isn't on it's... us like now, in a way that people... talk about, (client affirms) you know, sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">of forces pushing in both directions in like, better research and increasing sort of... brain research, that sort of supports and also since, at the same time, the population of analysts is aging.

(therapist affirms)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">THERAPIST: (pause) I think it's sort of more known about, in certain periods of like, humanity.

And I don't need to relate to people in that sort <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F1\">of like...
