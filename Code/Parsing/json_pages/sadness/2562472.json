I was there for about 14 hours. (laughs) I\u2019m tired. (pause) Mostly I\u2019m just annoyed because I borrowed a book from them and I started it and then I forgot to bring it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">with me today.  [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:06) My car is still broken so I\u2019ve been meeting them, switching off with them at the train station. She\u2019ll let the kids out on the way and she\u2019ll get on the train and I\u2019ll get in the car and drive back. I don\u2019t know how comfortable they are with that. I suspect <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">that she ends up getting to work a lot earlier, to begin with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: By public transportation do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yes. She always takes the train in, but typically I\u2019ll get there at 9:00 and she\u2019ll get on the bus at like 9:20 or so.  I feel like if she actually gets on the train at 9:00 she\u2019s actually getting there early, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s frustrating because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that convenient for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">them. It\u2019s not as convenient for me, although it\u2019s not that inconvenient; but I feel like this is a situation that I don\u2019t really have any control over. I can\u2019t afford to get the car fixed and James doesn\u2019t have time. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: How much would it cost to get the car fixed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, probably $100 or so. Not much, but I don\u2019t have that right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Things are tight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I got very righteously indignant when James was doing taxes. He hadn\u2019t in the last year paid estimated tax payments to Colorado because we just never had that money. Then we had a liability this year. It was like $10. I was like, \u201cNo, this is special circumstances. We didn\u2019t have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">the money. They shouldn\u2019t charge us for it. We should make this a thing. We should say that we are exempt from this.\u201d James was like, \u201cLet\u2019s just pay the $10. Let\u2019s just do it.\u201d (pause) Yeah, it is frustrating.  (pause) I think James is actually feeling like our financial situation \u2013 all of our situations <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">\u2013 are on the verge of changing and I just feel more and more like . . . I felt like they were on the verge of changing for about as long as I could, and now I don\u2019t feel like that anymore. I just feel like this is the way we are. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Sharon had a doctor\u2019s appointment yesterday, so I drove them down and dropped Monica off for work on the way back. She wasn\u2019t a happy camper about it. She is about 20 months now, so she knows when she goes to the doctor that she\u2019s going to get a shot. (laughs) She really doesn\u2019t like strange adults, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">so she was like \u201cthis is sketchy. I don\u2019t like this.\u201d  She is tiny apparently. I didn\u2019t quite realize it, but she\u2019s in like the second percentile in terms of weight, like 19th for height. She\u2019s just a skinny baby. (pause) Monica and I talked about religion in the car on the way over. (pause)  I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">like Christianity has a lot to answer for. She was talking about growing up in Kansas, in the only Hindu family in town and being told pretty often by her friends and neighbors that they were all going to hell. (laughs) She was like, \u201cThat sort of turned me off of religion.\u201d (laughs) It just makes me <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B3\">so mad. (long pause)  I\u2019ve been waking up like six minutes before my alarm goes off the last couple of days, which would be good if I would actually just get up, but I don\u2019t do that. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562472\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019ve been thinking about something to do with money for a little while and I imagine there are ramifications about stuff between you and me that would be worth talking about. I\u2019d be happy to forgive like two or three co-pays a week, so four our third and fourth visit, just charge you whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">the insurance pays plus the recording, but not probably like $25 or something on top of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: That would be a huge help for us, but I feel bad. (chuckles) Are you sure?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: Okay. Thank you. Yeah, that would be a huge help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Good. (pause)  I\u2019ll start when I bill you for April. I guess just let me know whenever [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:06).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. They change it every three to six months like $5 or $10, for no apparent reason. Maybe they\u2019ll start reimbursing us in one big lump sum, as opposed to 15 different checks, which is pretty good. (laughs) Yeah, it probably is something worth talking about. Why? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I wanted to see if it would help and it seems reasonable to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: It would really help. In part, it would help because it becomes hard to justify it to myself, coming here four times a week, so that would help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Good. I don\u2019t have a good answer to why now, as opposed to other times in the past or future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not a pressing concern for me. (long pause) I feel like I\u2019m saying \u201cyes, thank you\u201d because that\u2019s clearly the reasonable thing to do, but it\u2019s really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: What do you mean?  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re offering to make things easier for me and that seems sort of contrary to the way the world ought to work for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (long pause)  One of the blogs that I read is called Captain Awkward. It\u2019s [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:54) blog and there was a posting about going through periodic cycles of depression and during the cycles, her friends would do things like come over and make her a sandwich to make sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">she was eating because she would forget to eat. That\u2019s sort of basically taking care of her and she was feeling really weird and upset and did not want to do that and not be okay with that. The advice that the woman gave was \u201ceat the sandwich.\u201d (laughs) Just do it.  [That\u2019s what I was thinking of.] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">(ph?) (long pause)  I don\u2019t know what to say. Yesterday the doctor was holding Sharon and she was pretty anxious and unhappy and I was like, \u201cDo you want to go to mom?\u201d and she was like \u201cno\u201d and Monica was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d (both laugh) This is not okay, Sharon.  I like her a lot. She is very different from me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Monica?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes. (long pause)  She said she wanted me to take the kids to church with me, at least once. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever been to church.\u201d I said that would be good. (long pause)  I think it\u2019s [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:26). It seems like that\u2019s far more likely. (laughs) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562472\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I imagine you might be having a hard time here today because of the break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying not to think about it. (pause) Yeah, I sort of feel like I need to make it count, which is what I do, but James was telling me that Dr. Smith is having a baby, so she\u2019s going to be out for about two months. I was asking him if that was going to be okay and he was like [ ] (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">at 00:22:27) (laughs)  It was like well, for perspective, Chad is going to be out for half a week and I\u2019m sort of (voice breaking) anxious about that. I don\u2019t know. I mean . . . (pause) I think there is a strong likelihood that we\u2019ll be just fine. I certainly feel not all that anxious about it.  (long <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">pause) But you know, I\u2019m a little anxious and sad and I feel kind of weird about that. (pause)  There was an article by some explicitly Marxist newspaper, basically talking about stages of capitalism and saying that the open secret of capitalism in the early 20th century was misery, like the wealth <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200413\">of someone was built on the misery of others and the open secret of the mid-century was boredom so that we had the assembly-line job where you were taken care of physically, but you had nothing going on. And the open secret now is anxiety.  I\u2019m certainly getting anxious. (laughs) I tend to sort of eschew <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200414\">all such axial-age type arguments, like everything is like this for this period of time and there is this nice model that explains it. Look how well it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">I started writing down an exercise in absurdity, writing down all of the things that I was afraid of.  It\u2019s ridiculous, like I\u2019m afraid of garbage disposals. (laughs) I\u2019m afraid I will never be able to have kids. I\u2019m afraid of actually having children, like the process of childbirth. I don\u2019t understand <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">how anybody does that. And so on and so forth. (pause)  I think that was a good exercise \u2013 sort of. I don\u2019t know. [It sort of got it away from myself.] (ph?) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I heard what you said about your also feeling really anxious about these few things going on in here, like to do with capital. The other had to do with separation. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Like with the latter, I can\u2019t make it not happen. I wouldn\u2019t, in some sense, want to make it not happen because anybody should have vacations. I worry about you that you don\u2019t take longer vacations. (laughs) I feel like that can\u2019t be good. (pause)  But there it is. (pause) I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">want to make it hard for you. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: By making me feel guilty or worried? Is that sort of the thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) I was thinking about not seeing my mom for two weeks, like every other weekend. That was just a really long time, an incredibly long time for seven and eight. (pause) It did not make any difference when I said that\u2019s too long.  (pause) Yeah. I could tell that people felt bad, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">that wasn\u2019t actually getting me what I needed so . . . (chuckles) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, my impression is that this break is too long. I\u2019m not saying that in terms of how [ ] (inaudible at 00:34:08) decided to go away, I just mean it\u2019s too long in terms of how it feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like in some sense it actually doesn\u2019t really matter that much. Then it\u2019s like not seeing you over the weekend is too long.

(sniggers) It\u2019s sort of like whenever I\u2019ve been anywhere with Selena in the back seat, she\u2019s the worst back-seat driver. She\u2019ll be like, \u201cI think we should go this way. No, really. I know the way to go.\u201d Or be like, \u201cI think this is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">the longer way to get there.\u201d (both laugh) We\u2019ll be at a red light and after about five seconds she\u2019ll be like, \u201cThis is a really long light.\u201d (laughs)  For a while I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s really not, Selena. It\u2019s a normal red light.\u201d But then I was just like, \u201cYeah, I guess it is.\u201d It just feels like a really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200572\">long time to her. (pause)  For most of it, in the last six months, this is a \u201creary young yight.\u201d She\u2019s got the initial L\u2019s, but now she pronounces the initial \u201cyellow\u201d with the \u201cY\u201d as L\u2019s, too. \u201clellow.\u201d (sniffling) It\u2019s really sad because you can see her start to say \u201cyellow\u201d and then stop and think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200573\">about it and say \u201clellow.\u201d (laughs) I guess I should just leave that alone. I\u2019m pretty sure her mom worked with her a lot over that, like \u201cyou have to learn how to say this.\u201d (laughs) So now she\u2019s absolutely sure that the word is \u201clellow.\u201d (sniffling) (pause)  A lot of times, whenever I\u2019m sitting and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200574\">not saying anything, I think of \u2013 have you read [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:28)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Because that interchange with [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:36) character and his therapist where he says [ ] every word is an affront to silence and nothing.

(pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">I can\u2019t remember the reason. (long pause)  One of the only poems that I have ever written that I actually liked several years later, I wrote when I was like 15 and I had just started dating my boyfriend, Billy. It was a poem about different interpretations of time, like my experiences with time, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">the anxiety about time and how I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to be with him forever.
