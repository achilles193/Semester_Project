It is chilly. I know. We\u2019re actually by the window. It\u2019s really cold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">So, where are you? Where are things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: So, I saw Linda (ph) last week. She said she was going to call you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I have not heard from her yet, but I will reach out to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Which is really good. She hadn\u2019t heard about anything since November.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Oh, my goodness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So, it was a lot to (inaudible at 00:00:27) all at once. But I decided not to ask her for a recommendation to somebody else because (inaudible at 00:00:33) so nice to walk in and she knows who I am and she knows what\u2019s going on. Hopefully bad things will stop happening during Joshtmastime when <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">(inaudible 00:00:42) is here. And she reminded me I can always count on her, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. You should take advantage of that if you need to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: So, last time, I\u2019m sorry, I was a little nuts last week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Was that my professional assessment? I don\u2019t think so. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I was feeling \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: You were feeling . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: crazed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay. That\u2019s different. That may be true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: And then I was just exhausted the next week. Just I was so exhausted. I mean, I had tried some of the things we talked about. Tried to slow down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Hmm. Too hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: And it was just like a crash a little bit. And so, she said that makes no sense. And if I want to try, oh my gosh. Ativan to see if I could stop that somewhere before it crash. And I\u2019m suddenly forgetting what was making me so crazed. And I feel like it was still the infection and stuff going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">on with Josh that was making me just a little nutty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Well, he was in an awful lot of pain. And one of the things that you had talked about a bit was the immense amount of pain that he\u2019s in. And the fact that it\u2019s not well controlled. And just the constant switching, people not knowing from one shift to the next.  Some of the things that actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">do make an impact. And feeling so responsible for having to be the consistent person is a lot of pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Yes. And I tried to do some things at the hospital. I don\u2019t know if they really worked or not. But things were getting better, sort of. He\u2019s still there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">So, anyway. So, I had some Ativan. I really would have killed for Ativan the day of his surgery or several of the days after surgery (chuckles) so I tried one yesterday, just to see what it was like. And she said that maybe it would be a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah, see how it affects before you need it in crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Right. And I think I just got a little sleepy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah, some people do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: But it wasn\u2019t very much of it, either, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like it took the edge off at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I think so. Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s really (inaudible at 00:02:55) is that in a crisis situation or in a panic attack that you could take some of the edge off with something that works so quickly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. And she said I could take more if I needed it, so, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m supposed to go away this weekend. I\u2019m in a little bit of a panic over whether Josh is going to come home or if I\u2019m\u2014I feel okay to leave him. School\u2019s pretty busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561831\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Have you been able to go to school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. And in fact, today, someone is graduating and I had promised to go to their party tonight. Her graduation thing. Somebody I worked a lot with. And I told Josh (inaudible at 00:03:36) him today. And he got kind of sad. And I started feeling really guilty. And he\u2019s like, \u201cMaybe I can go <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">in the morning or the middle of the day.\u201d And then I started to just freak out about it. There\u2019s no way I could get \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s too many people that need you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. No way to get the work done I wanted to and see him and go to this graduation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mmm. It\u2019s hard to have to make choice about who gets you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Ugh. Well, and I told him when I saw him last night that I couldn\u2019t come.  And he got sort of upset because he\u2019s just been really lonely. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">So, anyway. So, I arranged for his mom to go see him. And I suddenly felt much better, once I finally decided I wasn\u2019t going to go. But if I had tried to, I would\u2019ve shown up here a total nut again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re being torn (ph) into many places. Torn in (inaudible at 00:04:24) directions. You can only take on so many roles at one time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Right. And it\u2019s really hard. Every day, I\u2019m trying to figure that out. Tomorrow, I know I\u2019m supposed to go there for (inaudible at 00:04:38) training in the afternoon, so I\u2019ll try to go school and do that. And hopefully, there\u2019ll be nothing else necessary to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">I\u2019m (inaudible at 00:04:50) a bit guilty about going this weekend, also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Where are you going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Ugh, it\u2019s a bachelorette party (inaudible at 00:04:57) had planned for like six months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Well, that\u2019s a pretty special thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. For my next door neighbor when I was born. I\u2019ve known her my whole life, so it should be\u2014if I was going to go to anyone\u2019s, it would be hers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re going to hers, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s like a ski weekend. So, that sounds \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And you\u2019re allowed to have a life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Do you know that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Well, I forget what I\u2019m doing lately, but most of the things I\u2019ve been doing have been coping things. Like I\u2019ll go exercise just to calm down. Relax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">Oh, yeah. Last Saturday, I went skiing with my mom. Just in Falmouth. Not far away. Just cross-country skiing. And it was, I don\u2019t know, something that is one of my favorite\u2014probably my favorite thing to do. And it was just so fun. It was more than just coping. It was just so fun. And I swear, every <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">time I going skiing, it throws me into a bit of a sad place. Because I know it\u2019s also Josh\u2019s favorite thing to do. I know if I tell him about it, he\u2019ll get really upset.  It was just so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s missing out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: It was more than just exercise. It was just so wonderful to be outside and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: It was living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: It was living! Right. And I haven\u2019t been doing things that are just really living. (inaudible at 00:06:12) everything feels like coping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Those are distinct, differently\u2014distinctly different things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Even when I go out with my friends and have a couple drinks, it still feels like coping. Even if, I mean, to pass time, we don\u2019t talk about, I mean, more\u2014depending what it is, I\u2019m not even talking about him or anything, but I don\u2019t know why it still feels like coping.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561831\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: But it feels like an escape from your life, rather than living your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Right. And so, this weekend will be more like living. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. And I think it\u2019s really important for you to live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Right. But it\u2019s going to\u2014I mean, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be really hard to do. I mean, the skiing made me really happy and then made me really, really sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah, because you want to be able to live with Josh. And you want him to be able to have some of this stuff, too. And he can\u2019t right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I know it (inaudible at 00:07:03) into, \u201cWell, why am I doing this? Should I just,\u201d I don\u2019t know. And unfortunately, (inaudible at 00:07:09) dinner later that night with a friend who, I don\u2019t know, doesn\u2019t really like Josh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Doesn\u2019t like Josh or doesn\u2019t the like situation that Josh is in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: She never got off\u2014over the whole when he stole a bicycle thing. I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s not someone I would trust for true life advice, but she still doesn\u2019t like him. She doesn\u2019t trust him. So, I\u2019m feeling really sad (inaudible at 00:07:32) a friend who disapproves, even though I don\u2019t take her <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D1\">disapproval for much. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">And usually, when Josh is feeling good, I\u2019ll just tell him, so\u2014 \u201cShe made me really sad because she\u2019s saying these things about you and they made me really mad.\u201d He can\u2019t handle that right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s too fragile right now to be able to take that kind of information in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. And in fact, it\u2019s been really tough, because he seems like he\u2019s feeling well sometimes.  And sometimes, well, we\u2019ve had a couple\u2014they weren\u2019t even fights. Maybe they were insights. I was telling him about the bachelor party and he doesn\u2019t remember things like that. (chuckles) I can tell <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">him (crosstalk at 00:08:17), I can tell him a million times. I think it was middle of last week. And how I was going to bring a coffeemaker and if that was okay with him. He got really upset, saying how he\u2019s afraid I would break it, I was really clumsy. He was really upset. I had also just taken a walk <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200932\">with him, trying to push his IV around with him. And it was just a mess. (inaudible at 00:08:38) was getting really frustrated. He was ready to rip everything out of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">And then, we were trying to\u2014it was a bad moment to try to have a conversation about how I was going to go away.

I mean, I got upset at him for saying that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200951\">I was clumsy.  And then he started to cry. I mean, this has happened a couple times over just nothing.

Really, yeah. Even if (inaudible at 00:09:20) careful not to say\u2014I mean, I made him cry so many times by just saying something that was\u2014if I tell him I hugged a puppy, (chuckles) then he might start to cry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s so absorbed in what\u2019s going on with him right now and in the hospital.

I mean, I feel like I\u2019m managing. It\u2019s really hard. Every single day is just really, really hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It\u2019s a lot to manage. To manage his world in the hospital and school and trying to maintain some of your world outside of the hospital. It\u2019s a little bit too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: That reminds me why, also, I was feeling crazy two weeks ago was because I had just\u2014I think I just confronted my\u2014not confronted. Asked my advisor if I could take a leave of absence. And he had said no. Whatever you can do (inaudible at 00:10:42). (chuckles) Now, we\u2019re all going to a conference <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">in April, for which he will pay for us only if we have legitimate results. Which he didn\u2019t ask\u2014well, he didn\u2019t ask (inaudible at 00:10:55) to go. He said I\u2019m going. And he said he\u2019s paying for me. He said I\u2014we all, the four of us who are going better have legitimate results.  So, that\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: But that sounds a little bit different than the expectation of however much you can get done this semester, you get done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Right. And I\u2019m still going to be involved with this group of people\u2019s work if I\u2019m at all at school. And they all need stuff [from me] (ph), so I was so thrilled to have that pressure lifted off. But now, there\u2019s a little bit of pressure. And that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just was a weight that was lifted <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A91\">for like a week completely and (crosstalk at 00:11:33) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: And now, a little bit of\u2014does it feel like it\u2019s all been put back on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: No. I know he knows where I\u2019m coming from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: So there is still some awareness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: But I\u2019ll have to have another discussion with him about what I\u2019m going to try to do. To see if I can \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Right, because you don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Is it even worthwhile?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: This is April? You don\u2019t know what April\u2019s going to look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: I know. They just put him at 1A (ph) again. So, he\u2019s at the top-top of the list. So, he\u2019s only competing with other people who are at the top. Of which there\u2019s still a good chunk, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to get a heart immediately, but . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: But the timeline feels like it\u2019s been sped up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess. We could legitimately get a call any time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Any time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Although it probably won\u2019t be for months. Yeah. And I know that when Josh comes out, it\u2014we still have not (inaudible at 00:12:28) a good discussion about us calmly. He had asked me the other day if I would take the leave, instead, when he got the heart, so that I could help recover. And I almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">started to panic. I thought (inaudible at 00:12:40) I just managed to stay in school. I\u2019m not going to take a leave again. (sighs) Once what we\u2019re hoping for happens and\u2014I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s asks a lot and he\u2019s very, very (chuckles) needy.  All of which is perfectly reasonable. It\u2019s just hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s hard to be on your end of that. You are not a limitless well of caretaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, depending how he\u2019s feeling, he\u2019ll say, \u201cFine, go to school. Get (inaudible at 00:13:25). But if he\u2019s not feeling well \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: But he\u2019s not always feeling up to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: At least, I mean, we spent the weekend trying to get answers from the doctor about what was going on. And he was really stressed about it. In fact, last week, he was pretty much on the verge of tears every day. And it\u2019s gotten a little better since we got answers. And they put him on Ativan, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">which I just think is funny. He made me feel really bad. I was really happy that I had something else to help if I needed it.  And he\u2019s just in a constant state of stress. He\u2019s never got all the right information. No one respects his privacy. He has no privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561831\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">THERAPIST: No, you really don\u2019t at that point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Right, but he also is not someone who likes to interact with people 24\/7. He always needs quiet time and it\u2019s almost impossible to get. We\u2019ve instituted so many signs. We got a nurse to put another \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign up again for a little while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">But anyway. I mean, I almost yelled at him that how could he possibly think that he would be\u2014basically, he said he felt like a junkie, asking for basically more Ativan to calm down. There was a kind of uncomfortable conversation with the nurse over how he was feeling. It took a lot for him to tell the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF1\">nurse how terrible he was feeling. (inaudible at 00:14:55) the nurse is like, \u201cYou seem fine this morning.\u201d He was like, \u201cI was ready to scream at you. You just don\u2019t know.\u201d  (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">So, anyway. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say here, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Is the Ativan helping him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been a push for a long time to try to get him to accept some sort of help, whether it be anti-anxiety or antidepressant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. But then there was always\u2014(inaudible at 00:15:23) it\u2019s always a weird conversations with the doctors. Similar to the pain med discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Feeling like he\u2019s not being believed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, more than that. More like they\u2019re always worried about him becoming addicted. Yeah. Yeah. And the (inaudible at 00:15:38). I mean, no one knows how he feels. He can only express that and it\u2019s hard to do that\u2014if you do it calmly, then it doesn\u2019t seem super-real. And then they say <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">things like, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem upset,\u201d when he\u2019s just trying to keep it together. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just really confusing sometimes.  (inaudible at 00:16:01) understand, so, anyway. It\u2019s working. He\u2019s on a schedule of Ativan now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for him to be really panicky and distressed. And that doesn\u2019t help recovery, so . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s exhausting himself. (chuckles) And his pain seems to be okay at the moment, too. He\u2019s just getting really depressed about never being able to leave. I mean, now they\u2019re saying next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And it\u2019s been next week for a lot of weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, he keeps saying (inaudible at 00:16:41) he just wants to stay in the hospital until he gets a heart, at this rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Because? Is he scared to go home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes, he is. Definitely super-scared. And it could be awful to have him home. I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I think it would probably be a lot of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Well, (inaudible at 00:17:04) like just him worried that something\u2019s going wrong all the time. I mean, he had some sort of bump or something under his sutures. He was freaking out about it. And all the doctors came to look at it. No one knows what it is. It\u2019s just (crosstalk at 00:17:18) \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200EC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561831\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s scary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Right. And if he got a bump, we\u2019d go to the ER or go to the doctor\u2019s. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s a lot easier to (inaudible at 00:17:26) call in a consult. And then have whatever tests available that you might need. Whether it\u2019s running a blood sample, seeing if that bump is an infection or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: (sighs) Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Taking a scan and seeing what it is. And being at home, you have to sit with more of that uncertainty for longer. And getting a consult is a lot more cumbersome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I feel terrible, because I just\u2014I\u2019m so sick of going to the hospital every day. It\u2019s just so much effort. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It is.  It makes sense that you feel tired of going to the hospital every day. And that you don\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s not what you want to do. If somebody had asked you what you\u2019d be doing this semester \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">THERAPIST: that\u2019s not what you would\u2019ve said. And of course you don\u2019t want to do it. At the same time, I know you really want to be there to support him. And you like to know as much what\u2019s going on as possible. So, it\u2019s hard to be so conflicted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, (sighs) the information thing (ph) at the moment, it seems like they just don\u2019t have (inaudible at 00:18:44). So, I don\u2019t feel as bad not being there now. I feel bad that he\u2019s so upset. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">THERAPIST: Is there anything else that feels comforting to him besides you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">CLIENT: I mean, whenever we have a new visitor, he\u2019s always\u2014he\u2019s a little better. We had some visitors on Sunday who were from out-of-town, who happened to be in Providence and came by. And he seems much more like himself when there\u2019s a visitor. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s comforting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, it\u2019s a good distraction, at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a good distraction (crosstalk at 00:19:25).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Maybe not comforting, but something to look forward to and a good distraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know what the right thing to do is. I hate to even suggest things.

Well, of the three, the movies seem best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) No. He loves PT, because I always tell him he\u2019s doing much better than average. So, I think that\u2019s comforting, in fact. And they put him up at 1A (ph) because he\u2019s physically ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Oh, great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Probably earlier than other people would be. Well, that definitely is comforting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, it\u2019s nice to have a little bit of athlete come back and help him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t know.

What it is that\u2014what worries you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: I mean, he always takes things to the extremes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: So, you think he\u2019s pushing too hard in PT?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: No. I just know that when he gets the heart, he\u2019s going to just\u2014I mean, I think he distracts himself by thinking what that will be like and what he\u2019ll do.

You\u2019re not going to get Washington back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s disappointing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">CLIENT: Well, (chuckles) I\u2019ve definitely come to terms with that. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m trying to say here, either. I would like to\u2014I don\u2019t know.  I mean, I keep thinking I\u2019m doing better, but I would like to not get myself into a panic on a regular basis over just trying to keep <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201491\">things together. That would be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: How often do you feel like you\u2019re panicking? Separating panic from that constant buzz of anxiety. How often do you reach the panic level, you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, there are so many different (chuckles) kinds. I was panicking this morning, because I felt like if I went to the hospital, I was just going to drive him crazy because I\u2019d be sitting there not able to help him at all, because I just needed to leave and go to school. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D1\">know if that\u2019s actually panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Well, what did it feel like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">CLIENT: I mean, it felt like panic. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I had to do something. And none of the options were good. But I had to do something, because I couldn\u2019t do [it all] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">THERAPIST: Do you feel frenzied?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. But then, the week I was feeling a little crazy, which, then, caused me to become exhausted, it\u2019s obviously not a healthy thing. And all I felt was panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20157\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Well, if you think about how it would be described in the DSM, for panic attacks, they\u2019re very discrete periods, fairly short-lived, typically. We\u2019re (ph) talking minuets, not days and hours \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">THERAPIST: of really intense that frenzied, feeling trapped, wanting to escape, heart pounding, thoughts racing. Fast breathing. That\u2019s what the DSM would call panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Versus the anxiety, which is the more constant worried thoughts. Maybe some of that physical distress, but not the same acuity.  Does that resonate for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">THERAPIST: So, the week where you feel like you kind of exhausted yourself, were there panic attacks in there, too? Because the other thing that\u2019s\u2014sometimes happens is you have a panic attack superimposed over the general anxiety. It\u2019s not that you only have to have one or the other. In a situation <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201631\">where\u2014with\u2014like yours, where there does\u2014there really are\u2014there\u2019s the real world triggers, like something happens with Josh.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20162-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20162-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561831\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">THERAPIST: Like you get a phone call and he says, \u201cThey\u2019re having a meeting.

That\u2019s what I do at night. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And those can create\u2014those can trigger a panic attack, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: What are the what-ifs that go on in your head at night?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Ugh. There\u2019s was just one night, I forget when, where I just didn\u2019t know how\u2014or I was reading a book that was too heavy. I shouldn\u2019t have been reading it before I went to sleep. It was too serious. So then, I just started thinking about life, which led me to think about how I was going to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201751\">it all fit together. That\u2019s what I think about. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always thought about is (inaudible at 00:26:28) planning things. (inaudible at 00:26:30) work out. Which is made worse when it just all seems so important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: I mean, the variables all of the sudden got (inaudible at 00:26:37). And it\u2019s always hard to think about how you\u2019re going to make everything work out, because, as probably part of you is aware, you\u2019re not actually in control of all that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I was\u2014Josh was supposed to come home this week. (inaudible at 00:26:52) today. Tomorrow. Wednesday. And this past weekend was just a mess. I was going to go away and I was feeling pretty determined to go away, regardless.  (chuckles) Which also made me feel really guilty, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201791\">I knew I\u2019d just be really sad if I missed my friend\u2019s party. And then, I had to\u2014I had a conversation with Josh\u2019s mom about how\u2014if she was going to be able to take care of Josh. And she said maybe. (inaudible at 00:27:21) I\u2019d have to bring him with me up to Maine where I\u2019m going. Which means I have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201792\">borrow your car. Which means we have to switch cars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just something that really, really complicated. And even just getting Josh home will be really complicated and (inaudible at 00:27:36) comfortable. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be in a panic for\u2014he keeps telling me how he\u2019s not going to move out of the living room until he gets a heart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just I was unfortunately relieved when they said he was going to spend another week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not necessarily unfortunate.  It could make sense. You feel safer with him there. And it\u2019s a little bit easier on you to have him there, because there are other people that take care of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s easier and it\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Yeah, the traveling is tough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: Yeah, but sometimes I get in a panic just driving over there. (chuckles) Driving over there at like 6:00 or something, because if I go too late, he won\u2019t be so exhausted. (chuckles) It\u2019s just so awful.

When I was living in Washington, originally, I was driving like 45 minutes to go 6 miles or something every day. And I started picking in my ear because I was so stressed out.

And I\u2019m sure he really appreciates you in the same way that he has in the past. But there are fewer ways that he can express it. And it\u2019s hard for him to be attentive to any of your needs, because his needs are so overwhelming. And it\u2019s really hard to be a caregiver. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201D11\">I think especially so young. This is not a role many women your age are thrown into.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">CLIENT: Actually, I think after I (inaudible at 00:34:43), we had a couple who\u2014the girl with the heart transplant was our age come with her boyfriend.

He was in the Army, so he\u2019s a little older. But he was just about to start undergrad. And we bonded over things just like\u2014not bonded, but it was nice to talk about things just like how, when you say (inaudible at 00:35:18) to get professors to believe him (inaudible at 00:35:19). He <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB1\">had just started school, so no one knew him. That his girlfriend was really ill in the hospital and he had to pretend that she was his fianc\u00e9e sometimes.

(inaudible at 00:36:02) hopeful.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201E8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561831\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Do you guys have plans to talk again or communicate again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201ED\">CLIENT: They come and see him every time she\u2019s in the hospital. So far, it\u2019s only been once a month. And, I mean, I know\u2014he said it was pretty disconcerting to come back up to the floor (inaudible at 00:36:20). I felt like I really (inaudible at 00:36:22) to them, I\u2019m sure I could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, it might be useful for you to just have some correspondence with him, because having a true understanding of what you\u2019re going through and what it\u2019s like can be really supportive for both of you. Some of the questions that you wrestle with. Giving yourself permission to go and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF1\">do something that\u2019s actually fun. To actually get to live a little bit of your life is something that he could probably really understand in a way that other people might not truly understand. Or you might not feel comfortable expressing to somebody else.  And having someone else who really gets it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">CLIENT: [And now] (ph), he does say that he hid from his friends. Because I was saying how I had hid from them. And (inaudible at 00:37:11) really great. He was saying he\u2019d done that (inaudible at 00:37:14).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s staying (ph) in hiding mode (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:37:21) little bit worried (ph) (inaudible at 00:37:22) with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">THERAPIST: I doubt that you\u2019re going to hurt him or make things any worse than what he\u2019d already experienced in having a partner who\u2019s so sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, and then the other kinds of things I guess I would want to say would be how awful the\u2014things that I wouldn\u2019t want Josh to ever know, probably. It\u2019ll probably take a while to have a relationship with this guy (inaudible at 00:37:52) say those things. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Are they things that you say in here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">CLIENT: Oh, sure. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">THERAPIST: And you think they\u2019re awful?

I don\u2019t hear them that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">CLIENT: Again, I would say these things to Josh if he was well, because then he would make me feel (inaudible at 00:38:21). (chuckles) Which is kind of what I\u2019m missing right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">THERAPIST: Right. You want him to be able to take care of you and help you with your hard feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">CLIENT: Towards him, which is weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s interesting, because it\u2019s not really him.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20213\">THERAPIST: Obviously, they\u2019re inextricably linked. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20215\">CLIENT: Well, and that\u2019s the same thing that I did when I wasn\u2019t sleeping. And then, I tried to break up with him, to see if (inaudible at 00:39:04) it would be fine on my own.  And he\u2019s the one who said (inaudible at 00:39:09) fix this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20217\">THERAPIST: Thinks he wants to help you fix it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20219\">CLIENT: (crosstalk at 00:39:12) it is, you can break up with me but (crosstalk at 00:39:14). I mean, I think he would understand if he was feeling well. And would be hopeful. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021B\">THERAPIST: Right. But in his fragile state right now, he can\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s no distance that he has right now from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N2021A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2021A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561831\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on in his head.

(chuckles) I wonder if the reason you feel like you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going is that there are lots of different places that you are in your head. I mean, if you\u2014if you were to listen to the playback, everything you\u2019re saying makes sense. It sounds like you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B1\">in different places. There\u2019s the part of you that wants to run away and have things make sense and be able to live your life.  There\u2019s part of you that feels really guilty for even thinking about it. There\u2019s part of you that wants to be there. And there\u2019s part of you that\u2019s just drained because you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B2\">are vacillating from a place where there\u2019s pressure to get some work done and be a functioning member of the team at school. And there\u2019s pressure to be at the hospital and be the person that\u2019s his main advocate. And there\u2019s pressure to help him deal with all of his feelings of heartlessness and anger. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B3\">And there\u2019s a wish for it to all go away and just be normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022D\">CLIENT: Well, and every week, it\u2019s a different combination that results in something completely different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, so it\u2019s hard to prepare for it. It\u2019s like any game plan that we create to try to manage these different pieces is really temporary, because the different pieces change from day to day or week to week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20231\">CLIENT: Well, I guess I\u2019m hopeful, because trying to deal with everything is what always gets me in trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. So, if we can whittle down \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">CLIENT: Like today, not going to the hospital, despite the fact that it made me feel really guilty is now making me feel not in a panic. It\u2019s good. It\u2019s just then I have to deal with \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">THERAPIST: What if you gave up your guilt?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">CLIENT: (chuckles) [I know] (ph). Yeah. (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">THERAPIST: I think accepting that you have limits. So, if there\u2019s three things that you\u2019re constantly juggling and you know that your limit is to deal with two of them a day, then you pick two a day and leave the guilt to the side. Of course you have limits. You\u2019re a human being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">CLIENT: I know. That\u2019s another thing.

And I feel terrible saying this stuff to him, because (chuckles)\u2014but I guess we\u2019re past the point where I just need to be there no matter what. He\u2019s been in the hospital for <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D1\">so long, it\u2019s not an emergency (crosstalk at 00:43:11).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">THERAPIST: You can\u2019t be.

(chuckles) [I was like] (ph), \u201cOh God (ph).\u201d (chuckles) And I\u2019m sure he was teasing, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202411\">also not a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20243\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

Her special macaroni and cheese, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202451\">and special this, and special that. And so, that\u2019s awesome, because I don\u2019t have time to make him food.

And he really needs to eat. So, anyway, so that\u2019s great. And so I\u2019ve been really appreciative of her coming once or twice a week with food. But he got really upset with her for not coming all the time, either. I\u2019m not sure what I was saying with this (chuckles) either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Because nobody can be there as much as he wants. And she\u2019s not reliable as someone to help you share or it sounds like she\u2019s somewhat reliable to help you share the burden, but not as much of it as you would hope. Or as he would hope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024D\">CLIENT: I mean, I guess he wants (inaudible at 00:44:45) all the time, 24\/7.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2024F\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s not sustainable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20251\">CLIENT: Right.

And find other people that can take a night or a day or even seeing if you can facilitate people to be a little <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202571\">bit more active in responding to the blog a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20258\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20259\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And allowing yourself to take care of you, too. Even if that means you do a tiny little bit less caretaking of him. Because your needs are also really important. And he can\u2019t meet them right now, so that means that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2025F1\">have to allow yourself to take advantage of the other times when other people can do that. Yeah. I think enjoying going cross-country skiing with your mom and going to the bachelorette, those are things that are really important for you.

It\u2019s okay to be sad. Allow yourself to experience the other things, too. So you don\u2019t let the sadness chase away all your good stuff. It makes sense that there be a piece of you that is sad, because you long for him to be able to enjoy it with you.  And it\u2019s part of the way that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202671\">honor your relationship. Let there be room for that, along with their being room for enjoying that you can be out there and you can celebrate with your friend. And that it\u2019s nice to be out in the fresh air and not inside the hospital.
