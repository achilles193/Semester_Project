I have way too many layers but I guess that\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: You can always lose some of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So where are you today?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: So today is our first day of classes. But luckily our first class isn\u2019t until Friday so we still have some time to prepare, which is good because I feel like we\u2019re definitely not very organized. Now this is Ryan who I\u2019m the TF for and he is always kind of like very last minute where I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I\u2019m the total opposite what with everything. To be very organized and planned and so we are supposed to send out a syllabus today which is kind of late anyway and I\u2019m still waiting for his final (unclear). I keep sending him e-mails and saying, \u2018I think the students kind of need it like by today if <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">they want to come prepared for Friday.\u2019 This is now the fourth year that I have done his course so I kind of get it and I feel like I need to remind myself to just kind of like take a step back and let it be okay. Like the beginning is kind of hard, too. And then things usually fall into place, so that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">kind of my plan. (Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I know and that\u2019s what I keep reminding myself, too. That it feels \u2013 it\u2019s kind of nice that I have this and now that my QP is officially done I can move on to think about my dissertation proposals so that\u2019s going to be like the focus of my work but it\u2019s so nice that I don\u2019t have other classes <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">to try and manage at the same time. So that felt good. And I also feel like sometimes I lack \u2013 like being a TF took up too much time so I feel like I have to start being careful about that now. Like I almost think that \u2013 even like at the beginning stages Ryan and I have met on the weekends, he\u2019s called <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">a few times like late at night, like things that I feel like I don\u2019t want to let happen further on but I have kind of let happen because we\u2019re in kind of like this frenzy of trying to get it ready. But I think I need to be careful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Set times for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I know in the past you\u2019ve kind of thought about, just kind of blocking out like when are appropriate times for him and how much time during the week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: For him for this class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: And maybe doing that again even if it\u2019s not something you outline with him, you\u2019d outline for yourself that sort of stops responding to e-mails after a certain time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: And I do think I want to do that and even last semester I kind of thought of like okay \u2013 I forget what it was but like Thursday is the day I only think about my QP and Wednesday is the day I catch up on Jeff\u2019s class or whatever. And it didn\u2019t always work that way but just kind of having that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">in my head and so I feel like I want to do better about that. (Unclear) always jokes now that Ryan is like my work husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: (Laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Because I had been waiting for a call from him during the day and then he didn\u2019t call and it was something we really needed to finalize before like shopping or something. Last weekend Todd and I were in the middle of eating dinner when he called so I was like, \u2018you know what, I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">interrupt our dinner but I have to talk to him because it was already so late. So I took it and Todd was totally understanding but joking, like one more sign he\u2019s your work husband. So it is like I think that I\u2019, sometimes I\u2019m pretty good, like I won\u2019t answer his call if it is too late but I\u2019ve kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">of let those boundaries down a little bit right now just because I feel like I want to get organized.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re anxious to get some stuff done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: So I think being more aware of that once the course starts and starts to level out, I want to try and be a little bit better about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Are there other TFs for this class, too? Are there other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes. We have one TF who\u2019s returning from last year which will be great and one who didn\u2019t work with us last year but worked the year before and she kind of took over as the head TF for me when I had Trae and she is wonderful. So I feel like (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: (Unclear) new people and you\u2019ve had that experience in the past, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: And then we have one other new person, too, but she seems really great. Because I almost feel like sometimes I get in that role of wanting to do it all myself just because no one really knows. It\u2019s their first time but it doesn\u2019t quite feel like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You rely a lot of these people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Let yourself rely on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yes, I need to do better, for sure. Yeah. And then this is also \u2013 Trae was sick all last week so it was my first day back on campus after \u2013 I came in for one meeting on a Tuesday when my mom was here but that was pretty much it. So I\u2019ve also just kind of felt like out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Out of touch with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. And thankfully he\u2019s better now. But we weren\u2019t quite sure. Like he had a really high fever. So that was kind of scary not really knowing what it was caused by and usually like he always had like a runny nose or whatever so we kind of knew where it was coming from. I think we brought him <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">back to the doctor. I think we went three times in the span of seven days trying to figure out what this was and then they thought he had a tonsil infection but then once the fever broke he had spots all over him like roseola so then they thought well maybe that\u2019s what it was. And so I still don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">if we ever knew. But now he\u2019s back on track but I just felt like last week was a long week just being kind of worried about him but also you know, just not like really getting a lot of sleep with everything else and so it feels good that he\u2019s (unclear). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: And it was kind of, I guess it was Todd\u2019s last \u2013 last week was his first week of classes starting out because Cambridge is on a different schedule. So it just felt like kind of a chaotic week trying to juggle everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve had a rough winter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I know, yeah. And it\u2019s only January. Hopefully, we\u2019ll have like an early spring. But then we keep joking, well okay we can add roseola to the list of things I can (unclear) now. But we actually \u2013 Todd and I are going to go away over \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: This is the first (unclear) you\u2019re not breast feeding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I know. Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s what it is. But we\u2019re going to go away this weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Oh good. You\u2019ll finally get that time.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. We gave it to each other like our Christmas presents to each other and we thought we\u2019d go in January and then like scheduling got all crazy and we thought we\u2019d have to push it out until March just because our parent\u2019s schedules and our schedules and then my dad had said no to this coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200531\">weekend because he thought his team would be in the Super Bowl so he\u2019d be going to Indiana. So one good thing about that is that maybe they could watch him for us because they have agreed to watch him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: Do you think they\u2019re experimenting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes. So I think that\u2019s just like coming at such a good time because I feel like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, you guys have been sort of holding on and looking forward to having some time away so you can reconnect and just really relax with one another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I know. I think it\u2019s just \u2013 and it has. It\u2019s just been so busy and I felt like last week kind of was like, alright, we need to make this happen. We\u2019re both so tired and Trae\u2019s been so sick and just have the time to focus on each other I think will be really good. And I think it\u2019s funny \u2013 I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">thinking back to our first overnight away from him in the summer, I guess, when we went to Providence and I was excited but I felt like I was dreading it like when I made the call to make the reservation I was like, I don\u2019t know if I want to do this. And it definitely feels better now. I feel like I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">more looking forward to it than being nervous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Well, you were nervous about your first time away and how he would do and what it would feel like for you. But it went really well. You had fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: So some of the jitters from your first time away I think answered some of the questions you needed answered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: So it\u2019s nice to have that to look forward to and I know, like my parents, especially my mom, like loves to have him there and I feel like that\u2019s something for her to look forward to, too, just because I\u2019m always worried about how she\u2019s doing too. So I think that will be good for everyone around. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad you guys will get a chance to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes. And I think like we had, my mom and my sister stayed two weekends ago, I guess, now, when Todd and Big Todd, my dad, went ice-fishing. And so that was good, too, just to like \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I think my sister is worried about my mom, too. But I don\u2019t know how much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Do you guys have as much reason to be worried as you both are?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Well, I don\u2019t think so. I know that she\u2019s sad and she tells me she\u2019s sad but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s like abnormally sad. I think she\u2019s experiencing a normal loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it would make more sense to be sad for her rather than worried for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: I mean your typical go-to place is one of concern, anxiety, worry. And I mean it makes sense that she\u2019s sad. Of course, she\u2019s grieving. But maybe that\u2019s not a worrisome thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I think it\u2019s more like \u2013 it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s not like it makes me feel anxious. Like I don\u2019t think about my mom and have those anxious feelings really. So maybe it is more like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201cworried\u201d, what do you really mean then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Then maybe I do mean \u201csad\u201d, yeah. And I guess I am worried for her. But like it\u2019s not \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: When you\u2019re worried for her, what is it that you\u2019re \u2013 what is your concern?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20078-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20078-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Just that, I hate thinking of her being sad. You know. And like my dad is \u2013 if he\u2019s out like busy at night or something. She has tons of friends at home, too. But I just hate that feeling of thinking of her being at home alone being sad when I know she has \u2013 our next door neighbors are <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">two of her best friends. So she has plenty of support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: She doesn\u2019t have to be alone if she doesn\u2019t want to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. But then we were also saying to her, like \u2013 I think sometimes my mom will hesitate to call \u2013 she hasn\u2019t yet picked up the phone and said like, \u2018I\u2019m having a bad day. Can we talk?\u2019 So we were trying to talk to her about that and saying like, \u2018I think maybe some of that is like we know you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">sad but we know you aren\u2019t really telling us about it because you don\u2019t want to make us sad. Like it just has this funny chain reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re assuming that she might be sad, or that she is, because she\u2019s not letting you know on the good days or the bad days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think she\u2019s kind of doing that to protect us in a way, like she doesn\u2019t want us to be worrying about her and she doesn\u2019t want her sadness to make us more sad or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s not limited to your concern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. So we were trying to like tell her that like so it\u2019s okay, if you\u2019re feeling sad it\u2019s okay. If you\u2019re feeling sad I know you\u2019ll pick up the phone and call your best friends or whatever, but you can also pick up the phone and call me, too. That isn\u2019t something that you have to protect us <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">from. So it was kind of like a good conversation and it all could have stemmed (unclear) because we haven\u2019t really talked much about like our feelings of being sad that whole weekend until Sunday. Like we had talked a lot about my grandmother and my mom brought a whole bunch of like her jewelry that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200872\">we went through. So we\u2019d been talking about her but not really like how each one of us was doing. And I started to get frustrated on Sunday because we totally got Trae off of his nap schedule and he didn\u2019t sleep well and sometimes it was like taking \u2013 if Todd and I want to do something you know, we <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200873\">have like a set window before his nap and it\u2019s hard like for other people to get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: The moment he wakes up he\u2019ll be ready to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right. So I wasn\u2019t being very sympathetic to that. But I was getting like frustrated like okay now it\u2019s like it\u2019s like almost 10:30 and he\u2019s still needs to be home by 12:30 so it kind of came out badly and we\u2019d gone to the museum which was really fun but we went kind of late and got home so <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">late and so part of me is that I don\u2019t like to be the parent who is such a stickler about naps because if we\u2019re out doing something fun I feel like it\u2019s okay to be flexible. But on the other hand I was like we came every Wednesday with us so we could have it be like an easy weekend for Trae. It\u2019s my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">mom and sister so we can be accommodating to him I felt like, whereas I felt like if we were hosting like friends or something who don\u2019t get it, maybe I wouldn\u2019t want to be back right now. But we were out with my own mom and sister I was thinking like we could be accommodating for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Allowed to be a little bit more demanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I felt myself getting in a bad mood about it all. And I certainly didn\u2019t like influence the whole weekend but I felt myself by Sunday be like, okay, now we\u2019ve kind of like thrown him all off his schedule and so we started talking about that and then I think I like automatically got <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">like just by talking about that like something I was frustrated with about the weekend, then worrying like have I gone and ruined our weekend when I wanted so much for it to be like a good weekend for my mom not to be sad like open the door to everything and I started crying because I was worried about <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F2\">her and sad about Mimi and my mom started crying and so in a way I was kind of glad that \u2013 I don\u2019t that we would have had that conversation so I guess that was good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: It was a good conversation for everyone to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I don\u2019t know, I think that it helped the situation. But at first I \u2013 and I still don\u2019t know if I was overreacting about his naps anyway. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to find that balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: I think you weren\u2019t just reacting to the naps. You obviously have this sort of concern and had things that you wanted to be able to say to your mom that were sort of there under the surface and that made you wonder if you were more easily frustrated about other things. It was all this other <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200951\">stuff you were kind of hanging onto.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that that probably was part of it too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s no rule about how much do you react about naps and how important is the schedule when there\u2019s no \u2013 you felt what you felt. Probably spurred by a couple of things that were going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s funny like I\u2019ll react to something and then it\u2019s always like I\u2019ll still feel like that, like it\u2019s sad and it\u2019s still there, that sadness about Mimi. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll react to but then it will make me think about her. And then it will turn into being <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B1\">sad about her, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I think that shows that it\u2019s part of what \u2013 even if you\u2019re not directly focused on it, it\u2019s part of what you\u2019re \u2013 whether you think about the (unclear) process of your body or your mind or your heart or whatever your language is for it, it\u2019s going on there, that grieving process for that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D1\">loss is ongoing and will be for a while whether or not you\u2019re attuned to it at the moment. And that\u2019s I think why you have that experience of reacting to one thing and then realizing then you end up talking about the feeling of loss or the sadness that you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I\u2019ve even noticed, because our friend who had a stroke a month ago, she was just back in the hospital. Everything\u2019s fine but she needed a medication adjustment for her and so it was another scary window for a little while and now everything is totally fine but it\u2019s funny like I feel \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F1\">like it\u2019s funny how those two things are almost connected for me because I think because they happened so close together that Todd took out her husband for like a night out on Saturday and her husband is so sad about the whole situation and it\u2019s still like a day to day situation until they can make <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F2\">sure that she\u2019s going to be fine. She ended up with about four tears in her arteries in her neck \u2013 not just the one. So it\u2019s still \u2013 she\u2019s going to be fine but it\u2019s just a scary period and I think they went through so much. It\u2019s just such a traumatic time and so Todd took him out and it\u2019s just been <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F3\">really hard for him so that got Todd and me talking about it all and even that \u2013 feeling sad about Sarah, but then I also think about Mimi too because everything is just all kind of mixed in.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And everything happened so close together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: I\u2019m thinking of her as a mom and you know my grandmother as a mom to my mom and like I feel like it\u2019s just all \u2013 it\u2019s interesting how lots of little things are bringing her back up to me in different ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. Which isn\u2019t bad either. Like I kind of like that too, that I am (unclear) about her so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: For her already to be gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So and I think it\u2019s good too that, I know my mom hasn\u2019t since we were all together, she hasn\u2019t really like picked up the phone but I feel like at least now we can kind of get that \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s been acknowledged that you would be okay with that. She might not need that. But even if she doesn\u2019t need to have one of you girls be the person that she calls, being able to say out loud that you\u2019d be okay with that and that she could if she wanted to, feeling a nice offer of support <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD1\">and it\u2019s acknowledgement of knowing that she might have days that are harder or (unclear) more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I think \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">THERAPIST: How often do you pick up the phone and call?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well, I was saying to her, like I don\u2019t do that either. When I\u2019m like feeling sad, you know, if I have like a moment during the day or whatever. I don\u2019t really pick up the phone and call her either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Do you want to and don\u2019t pick up the phone? Or don\u2019t feel like you, even though you\u2019re having a sad time, don\u2019t really need that? What stops you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t really feel like I have to because I feel like I can talk to Todd about it. Sometimes it just feels like a passing thing, too. Like Trae still gets me. Like every time I put him to bed he still wants me to read this one bedtime story that totally reminds me just of everything or <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">my grandmother\u2019s picture is still on his night side table and so he still like talks to her and everything. But I feel like, then I put him to bed and it\u2019s kind of passed anyway. And I\u2019ve noticed there have been happier things that I will call my mom to say like something that I remembered or \u2013 I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B72\">had all these like funny stories with \u2013 three things have happened so far where I\u2019ve found something of hers in my shoe which is so weird. When we were going through her jewelry. Yeah. I dropped something and we searched the entire floor and it ended up in my boot. And then when we came home and I found <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B73\">a keychain she had given me in one of my slippers. I think Trae put it there. And then the third time I found this like little thing we had \u2013 we were giving out these little like favor things at her party and one of the favors was in one of the boots I put on the other day. So I have been calling my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B74\">mom about stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">CLIENT: Cool, just little coincidences, you know. So the happy stuff I feel like I\u2019m telling her about but I haven\u2019t \u2013 and I told her that and she said, \u2018well that makes me feel bad that you feel like you can\u2019t call either.\u2019 But I think it\u2019s both of us being worried like if I call her crying I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB1\">to make her cry and vice versa. You know, when \u2013 I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you sometimes don\u2019t need necessarily to call. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Because you experience a feeling or a thought and it passes. And that\u2019s okay. Not every \u2013 you might not need somebody else to acknowledge or help you with every kind of feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. And maybe that\u2019s also happening for her. To have those times that either she can talk to your dad or somebody else or it passes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Right. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that grief is a very normal process and it\u2019s not the same as being depressed. I think sometimes grief can lead to depression but it doesn\u2019t always. Very often it resolves in a normal, healthy way and those feelings, while uncomfortable, don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">necessarily need any sort of special attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C9\">THERAPIST: It works. The process works. In the kinds of talks that you have, in the ways that you are to your mom, even without doing anything necessarily extra-special.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CB\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Because you have a relationship where you do talk and you do have fun together and you see her when she comes to take care of Trae and you spend lots of time \u2013 all those normal things you do in your everyday relationship work to help each other through any kind of hard process that comes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a lot that works really well and you have a very healthy relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And that\u2019s been good too, to just remind each other that we are so lucky that we are so close and can help each other and so that\u2019s been helping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: You just do all the things you guys do normally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D9\">THERAPIST: That you\u2019ve developed over the course of your lives have worked to create <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s all you really need in a situation where it\u2019s a very normal grief process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think when we\u2019ve had \u2013 we\u2019ve lost other people in our family, but I guess when I was younger \u2013 my grandfather, my stepdad Todd\u2019s dad passed away when I was in high school and then we\u2019ve lost other people when I was in high school I guess. But maybe just because I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">more aware of my parents\u2019 feelings now or whatever \u2013 I feel like I just had such a close relationship with my grandmother.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, I wonder \u2013 there was something that you said early on after she passed away, was it being the first time that you\u2019ve lost somebody having been a mom now made it feel really different. And I wonder if the parallel of you being a mom, your mom losing her mother and these three <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E11\">generations of women have a very close relationship, I wonder if all of that makes you much more empathic to what your mom is feeling and also makes your own feelings stronger because there\u2019s so much that you identify with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Certainly, when you were in high school you processed things in a different way, a whole different set of life experiences in which to put it. And adolescents tend to be a lot more, naturally and appropriately so, focused on themselves and are much more self-centered and really so much of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E51\">what you\u2019re experiencing is that you\u2019re not just focused on your own feelings. You\u2019re very aware of, and imagining and trying to be perceptive of what your mom is feeling, what your sister\u2019s feeling and \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I think it\u2019s, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re kind of on this (unclear) like you\u2019ve just been saying \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E9\">THERAPIST: That you can just kind of put it out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB\">CLIENT: Even if it\u2019s just joking. Like my mom was saying, \u2018let\u2019s make up like a code word that you can say if you\u2019re feeling anxious about getting home for Trae\u2019s nap. And then I said, well then we can use the same code word for you being sad. So we\u2019ve been joking about a code work. I think I was kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200EB1\">of feeling, and my sister even too, like is mom okay or is she like not calling because she is okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Do we know what\u2019s going on?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">CLIENT: Yeah. So that feels a little bit better. Just kind of moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It feels like it gives you more permission to ask, too. Now that it\u2019s sort of been said and that gives you more permission to ask about that and makes them more aware if you\u2019re doing something to ask like, \u2018hey, is it important to be back?\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) So I don\u2019t even, I feel like not sure what else is on my mind. Like those have been the biggest things and then just thinking forward to the start of the semester, too. I feel like it\u2019s been kind of nice to have like January be this kind of down time with just like without classes <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F31\">going or anything and so now just kind of thinking about how it will feel like this semester starting up again and I feel like it\u2019s exciting that a part of me is excited for the class and then excited to start working on my dissertation proposal are like the good parts and then another part of me is <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200F32\">like, oh, but having that class is so much work and will I have enough time for my own stuff and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F5\">THERAPIST: You need to create a schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I think it\u2019s just the newness of going into like the next semester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F9\">THERAPIST: It will take you some time to develop a pattern that works for you to get your TF work done and research done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FD\">THERAPIST: What are your goals in terms of timelines for your proposal, or are there goals?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">CLIENT: Well, I\u2019m hoping to do \u2013 with a dissertation proposal, we have to get it approved by our committee but also by a school-wide committee on degrees which we didn\u2019t have to do for our qualifying paper and so there are only certain times during the year when you can submit to the committee on degrees <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF1\">and the last day is in April. So I\u2019m hoping to get the proposal done by April so then I can have everything in place to start collecting data when school starts in September. But I\u2019m not sure if that is like unrealistic or not, so I kind of have it as a goal but I don\u2019t want to be like too set on that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF2\">because I realize it\u2019s almost February now so it could be like really tough. Just knowing how long the process was with my qualifying paper, getting like professors\u2019 feedback and everything felt so drawn out so \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">THERAPIST: Right. Doing it in sort of two and a half months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure. Like some of my friends have said once you know what you want to do you can just bang it out and it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. It can only be like there\u2019s a maximum limit that ends up being like 30 pages double-spaced. So it\u2019s not like a huge thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201031\">to put together, but then thinking about my qualifying paper proposal, that did take from the beginning to get it approved \u2013 it took like a big span of time. So I\u2019m not quite sure that it will all be in place by then.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20102-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20102-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561815\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">THERAPIST: Do you know what you want to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">CLIENT: Not quite. Like I want to build off of what I did with my qualifying paper but I\u2019m not quite sure which way I want to go yet. And then I was kind of like, the whole month of January \u2013 I can just be like brainstorming and by the end have this like great idea. So that hasn\u2019t really happened. So <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201071\">I\u2019m meeting with all my committee \u2013 almost all of them this week so I think I\u2019m in a brainstorming mode but I\u2019m not quite sure, like when I\u2019ll actually have the idea all nailed down or not. And it\u2019s funny, I also felt like applying for the Brown Ed Review just took up a big chunk of time in January, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201072\">too, which I (cross talk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Than you anticipated?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLIENT: Because then, I think the last time I saw you I was about to have the interview and get those editing tasks and stuff and so it was just like you only had he 48 hours to finish it but I felt like that took two days out of my week and \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: (Cross talk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. And luckily I was glad I just used my day care time. Like I didn\u2019t, because I was worried \u2013 am I going to feel like I have to be like I\u2019m not even working on it and I don\u2019t even think I worked on it at night. And I think it worked well just because there wasn\u2019t really a right or wrong <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201131\">way to answer things so I just kept telling myself like just do the best you can and just be done with it. And I think I just put so much time into it that by the end I was just like \u2013<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">CLIENT: Get rid of it. Yeah. And so I was glad that I had that reaction instead of like trying to make \u2013 and I think I was, trying to go a little overboard trying to make everything perfect, but by the end I was just kind of ready to let it go. So now I\u2019ve just like totally put it out of my head and <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201171\">just because I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s still hanging over me too, is I\u2019m still not quite sure how I even feel about it. Like I know that I would really enjoy the work, but I\u2019m still not sure if it would be too much to add on or you know. So I think that\u2019s just another thing I can think about later, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201172\">but it was something that took up more of January and with Trae being sick pretty much all of last week there were just \u2013 it was just the month went by a lot faster than I expected. But it was nice to just kind of feel disconnected from like the day to day school stuff since classes weren\u2019t in session <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201173\">even though it felt like there was a lot of little work stuff that I had to do. It still felt like a break because it wasn\u2019t the same stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: And you weren\u2019t responsible for the same set of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">THERAPIST: The mantra is to give yourself flexibility and see how the process goes and if you\u2019re ready for that April time then you\u2019re ready. If you\u2019re not, you can do it the next round. And giving yourself the flexibility to work in a way that works best for you overall. It\u2019s not just this one part <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D1\">of your life that you\u2019re trying to manage.
