Right across from the subway entrance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. (pause) And we're on for 5:10 or 5:15 or something on Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: And then I'm out the following week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: And we won't meet the next two Fridays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. Alright. (sounds like drumming hands on a surface) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: How are those hands?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Busy, I guess. (pause) Yeah, they feel like they're getting rough. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: (laughs) Calloused?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And also I have tendonitis somewhere, I think my elbows. Because I was doing pushups every morning and also doing a lot of biking which, you know on a bike you can be kind of straining your upper body. It's not too bad but I've been biking like twenty miles a day or fifteen, twenty miles <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">a day. So I think those combined gave me my tendonitis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: More notably though, this week, either or Tuesday or Wednesday, my neck, I woke up really stiff. I don't know if it's a consequence of having the air conditioner on or what, but my neck is just really stiff and I couldn't turn that well without hurting. I mean I could move it but it would hurt. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">It's just very stiff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">And it's strange because I'm [quickly getting better when I do] but I'm still fixing people's bikes. And the owner (inaudible at 00:02:33) in a lot of ways because it's someone who knows more. They tell me, \"Do this, do that and the other thing.\" So it's strange that my neck's kind of like stiff and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">forcing me to look downward as I've sort of migrated towards the role of just doing as I'm told.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Like the subservient downward -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Right. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Yeah. The gesture, the physical gesture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I couldn't quite kick it. It feels a little better now. I tried ibuprofen the other day, it didn't do too much. I tried a hot bath and it's getting a little better. [It's just these two knots up here in, whatever you call it, the spine, disks.] (ph) Yeah, there's just this stiffness right <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">here. It's also, it's reminiscent almost of this working, this regular pain (ph) position of like in second grade. Did I tell you this? In second grade I built forts for people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: Well in second grade there was sand in a playground. It was like an actual playground at our school and there was sand there at sort of one sort of edge of the playground bordering some very big fields. There were a few friends, I guess, but these boys that we, every recess we would, we'd have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">all these toys and we'd have like a fort for them to play in. So I'd make a fort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">And I'd do it very quickly and efficiently and eventually there was one kid who just would be grabbing all the coolest toys. So he sort of designated me as like \"fort maker.\" But he was pretty well off. Like he, I don't know what his father did. He was sort of bossy but it didn't register at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I just, you know, I had my role. I just made the forts because I made the best forts. Like another kid would try it I don't know if this is true, but I think it happened once. And another kid would try it and he would be like, \"No, no, no, Brandon makes better forts.\" And so I'd make the fort. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">I think my mother didn't like it though. I don't think [I registered that the executive] of him as some sort of analog for a classist, superior, if my mother sort interjected at some point, but she didn't like him or didn't like how he treated other kids or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: But it didn't seem to bother you until she said something? And it kind of influenced how that sort of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Maybe it did. I'm not sure. It's hard for me disentangle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. Yeah. But you liked it. There was some element, though, of liking building the forts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Oh, I loved building forts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: My fingernails would get dirty or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: You know, I liked being recognized for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like the deliveries. The way you described the deliveries. That there's something kind of like good about getting, developing a competency at it and being seen as such too. As the guy who could be really relied upon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But, you know, I was thinking too though that just as you were kind of describing the bike shop, in some way you feel like that you like I get the sense that, the impression of you, that you like the work in some way. You like learning and you like developing, but you added the element <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D1\">of the power differential and it somehow gets entangled there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Is he seeing you as subservient? How is that influence, if I'm taking the direction from him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I have the benefit of my work now where it doesn't matter what you say. Either you can do things or you can't do them. And so I came in there not knowing how to do practically anything but I faked my way into it and now I know how to do things. So it doesn't matter. Like we had like a four a.m., <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200631\">Saturday, text conversation where he (laughs) accused me of knowing He said, \"You don't know one half of one percent of what fits (ph) on brakes.\" But he ended up apologizing in person. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: But he knew. I mean he knew that you were learning on the job. You didn't fake it in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: What makes you feel that you kind of like conned your way into it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I had trued one wheel before I The test for the job was truing a wheel and I had trued one wheel beforehand, so I trued a second wheel in front of him. So that's why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: But he knew, didn't he?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: I mean I thought you were just I mean the way you described is as if he caught on right away. I thought that was the whole basis of why he was going to pay you less under training.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: No, that was after the first week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Got it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: I see. I'm sorry. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, so he came to understand it.. It's not that big of a fake. And even if it is a fake it's not something to be very proud of. It's not to be ashamed of either, but it's just like, you know, you're a bike mechanic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: (laughs) But then you also said, \"Okay.\" You know, you worked it so you would learn from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I like what I'm doing and power (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: (whispering) [You said \"power,\" yeah.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: It's more like he's sort of (pause) Yeah, he can be obnoxious and I need to be able to set up sort of, I guess, where I'll stand up and just say, \"You know, you really shouldn't do that.\" Like he tried to criticize my own business of fixing bikes. Like, \"Yo, what are you doing?\" We'd joke <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">about it because I use these products. Like I use what's available. I might just use WD40 to clean the chains and like Armorall to wipe down bodies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: So apparently if you're some connoisseur Armorall can wash off with rain and get into your tires and soften the sidewalls over time. And WD40 is supposedly bad for bike parts, though I've never had a problem with a chain. I don't know. You're supposed to use some higher class lube. And I do <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">use lube afterwards but you can't beat WD40 for just cleaning something out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry. Something is flashing. No it's alright. Sorry about that. So he was critiquing you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: Right. And so we were joking about that and that's fine. You know, it's like, \"Oh, what do you do to these poor people who give you their bikes?\" And that's fine. But then I get these text messages, you know, and they sort of (pause) I don't know [if it was on the] (ph) text. But getting serious <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B1\">and saying like, \"Hey, you really should be doing things this way.\" Or, \"When you look at someone's bike you should do this, this, this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">And that's not his business. He can tell me what to do in the shop and how he wants things done, and I can do them to his satisfaction or he can fire me. But he shouldn't be telling me how to fix other people's bikes in a serious way. (inaudible at 00:10:35)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: You felt like it was an affront, the way you describe it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: It's not his business. I mean I don't have the right to take offense because I don't know that much, but at the same time that's my business, literally. It's not his business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Like it was like he was -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: He was telling me what to do at home to other people's bikes who had come to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Why are you meddling in my affairs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, right. The line stops here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Like I don't tell you what kind of car to drive -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: or, I don't know, what to drink.

He also, I don't think he, while I think he has technical knowledge, he doesn't always know how to weigh things. This is, people (inaudible at 00:12:16) their bosses but he doesn't know how to weigh the priority or importance of things. Like we'll be fixing a part, and there could be any <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A91\">number of things wrong with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">And even I know there could be like five different things wrong with it. And instead of trying to figure out what it is and fixing it, he'll just name one of the five things, fix that, and then, you know, it still doesn't work. And he will name something else with absolute certainty and we fix that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB1\">and then it turns out it wasn't that. Then he names something else and fix that.

But the other things is that we have this, he messaged me and he said, you know, \"You don't know \" What happened was he said, \"You know, if you ever need anything just let me know.\" Because he gets part for literally one fifth of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">the cost that I get parts for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: He has a huge, and he's like, \"If you ever need anything,\" and he has all these parts lying around, \"If you need anything I have all this stuff so just let me know.\" So I said, \"Hey, do you have this type of tube,\" because I need to bring a bike in on Sunday to the meeting. Someone there. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">all the bike shops only open at twelve. So I said something to that effect. And then I found out that there is a bike shop that is open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">So what he suggested I need this tube that has the right size valve. He suggested, eventually, like at three a.m. on Sunday morning or Sunday morning, he suggested he had the other kind of rim and a drill bit. So he suggested drilling into that and changing the size of the hole for the tube. Which <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">I thought was funny because it's more complicated than it should be. Like getting the right size tube rather than fucking with a rim and then you have metal shavings and you might pop the tube when you change the, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">But I thought that was funny and I said, \"Well, actually it turns out that there's a bike store that's open.\" This is like at three a.m. again on Sunday morning and there's a bike store that's open at nine a.m. And I looked on Google maps and of twenty bike stores there's one that opens at nine a.m. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">and so I decided to go there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">And so after that, the way I saw it is, I mean, you ask someone for help, they agree to help you, you think their help is final (ph), and then you don't get their help. That's kind of [their fault] (ph). Like no matter what you say it's kind of like it's a dick thing to do. Well, it's not a dick thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD1\">to do it's just it's not a favorable position. But then again, I mean, I'm apologizing for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">But he freaked out and made these angry text messages. (laughs) Like, \"You know one half of one percent of what you need to know for bikes.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? (laughs) He got offended that you didn't take his help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. But he also, plus he was like, \"You know, I have \" He does have like a hundred bikes. He's like, \"I have some bikes that need work, so if you want to work on those to get up your practice, feel free.\" But it was kind of like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">Oh yeah. So it's like, \"[I never tried it with a drill.] (ph)\" He's like, \"Why would you have? You do know about half, one tenth or five percent of what you do is (inaudible 00:16:11). If you try to rush this you won't learn properly. I'd really like to see you focus on learning things properly \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: \" than bastardizing poor people's defenseless, piece of shit bikes.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: If you want to work on regular bikes too I have [plenty here that I've put together] (ph) too that could help you gain some experience.\" And I don't want to be on the defensive so I just said, \"Thanks for thinking of me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: He wants to mentor you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I said, \"Thanks for thinking of me.\" And so I guess that's ambiguous because I did feel I felt like, okay, you know, this guy I need him. I need him so it makes me kind of upset. And so it's four a.m. now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: All through the night, huh? Or the morning now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: And he said something like, \"I'm not trying to insult you, but you know there's a lot more to know and learn than you may realize. It took me years to learn what I know now and I'm still learning. That's why I laughed at you the other day when you said, 'Do you (inaudible at 00:17:15),' and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D51\">then did a Civil War bicycle repair reenactment.\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">THERAPIST: (laughs) What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">CLIENT: Civil War bicycle repair reenactment. Well I think of like medics in the civil war amputating people's legs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Oh. (laughs) The reference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was also taking like a hammer a chain and he's like, \"That's not good.\" THERAPIST: I think he wants to mentor you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Sure. (pause) Right. That's the other thing. So if he gets upset at me he'll interpret that in technical ways, which aren't necessarily true. So related to not knowing which of the one of five things wrong it could be, or not being willing to figure that out before fixing things. You know, after <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">this he sort of figured out that the spoke tension on bikes was too tight and that I'd been making them too tight all along and it's completely unsuitable. But the spoke tension was fine on the wheels, most of them anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">And so he sort of like invented this \"something wrong with the bikes\" that's sort of an offshoot of, I interpret it's an emotional reaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: So it's someone who has done a lot by themselves and sort of, you know, emotions and logic and self-interest, they all sort of bleed together. It's not really predictable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Chambers. (ph) You know, realms of discourse. (inaudible at 00:19:36). But as you can imagine, I'm not the best mentee or prot g , you know. I mean I keep my head down but He also tries to, like when someone comes along and tries to like, he'll say like, \"Oh fix this, Brandon. Or do this or <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">do that,\" as if he's trying to show that he's in charge only to the other person. That's how I interpret it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">Really though, something I say is, if someone ever tries to insult me it disrespects themselves. So I'm like fixing the bikes, fixing a number of derailleur issues and getting the people going. [We've got to get people going.] (ph) They pay their rent with that cash at hand. And I fixed the pedal (ph) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB1\">caps. That was the problem. So for thirty minutes before I go off, he does the major stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">But, you know, I'm working and I, you know, I mean we sort of have a running joke about my hygiene, because I don't really care if I have a greasy face. I mean I recognize it looks pretty bad but at the same time I just, I'm not going to be washing my face all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">But when I'm working on people's bikes and then he says something, he said the other day something like, \"Oh it's going to rain. Good, Brandon.\" Like I'll finally take a shower, you know, you don't have to be disgusting or whatever. I mean it doesn't look good on hand, I don't think, because I'm the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">one working on the bikes and fixing the problems. Well between us it's a joke. But when there are other people present it sounds mean spirited, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Well, yeah. It's kind of humiliating in a way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Right. And it does appear that there's an objective to kind of show that the he's the guy on top. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. He wants to kind of show, it demonstrates power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: Yeah. He's also someone who craves attention, you know, in an unhealthy way. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say \"unhealthy,\" but it's kind hard to deal with because he craves a lot of attention. And not just in terms of being the boss or anything, but his jokes. It's like The Office. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: What I was thinking about is that in some way you seem, despite all that stuff, it doesn't stop you necessarily from wanting to take something from him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: But it complicates it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not good in those situations. Like if he can't set clear boundaries within himself, for me the relationship, it's very difficult for me if there's something I don't like. Maybe I'm not adept at fixing problems in relationships. I can fix things mechanically, but in relationships I'll <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201031\">just cut the chain. I'll just, you know, if something doesn't work out and if fixing it requires me to sort of put myself in a vulnerable position, it's not going to happen. I'm just going to cut the cord. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: What about the vulnerable position?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: It was good. It's not that important. You know, [except for the interpreters.] (ph) (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: (laughs) I think that's it. A vulnerable position. What makes it vul -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: Well, let's take for example, did I tell you about Danielle? I told you about Danielle. We were supposed to meet on Monday. But also there was this girl who -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, see you. What did she say? Yeah, \"let's do it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: \"Let's do it, Monday,\" or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, when she texted you. The text messages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: That's one thing. But there was another girl the Friday before, which was my birthday, I had sort of met her. My birthday was Friday. I met her Thursday night at a function and I was just like, \"So what are you doing tomorrow?\" And she was like, \"Nothing.\" I was like, \"Well, it's my birthday. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201171\">Can I kind call you if I end up doing something? Would you like to do that?\" And she said, \"Yeah.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">Basically (pause) Yeah, I mean I had her. You know? Like she was, whatever I wanted to do she would, she wanted to spend time with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: I sensed that. But, it's like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:57) (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: [A positive, huh?] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: (laughs) (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: I just, well yeah, she had been texting me and I didn't even know who she was because I didn't have her in my phone. I'm the shit basically and she's the shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: The what? The ship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: The shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: Oh. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: (laughs) That's how I felt about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: You like her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: No, I don't. But she wants my attention, I think. You know? So, I said, \"You know, it's my birthday and [if I end up doing something would you come along?] (ph) She said, \"Yeah, definitely. Give me a call.\" So then my brother came for my birthday and, sort of to show him that I'm not a complete <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201311\">loser and also just to finalize plans for the evening. So I e-mailed everyone in the morning. I just said, \"Hey Felicity (ph) \" (pause) Do we have to do this? It's stupid. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20130-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20130-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">THERAPIST: Why? Why do you feel Something about reading the text?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So I was like, \"Alright.\" So I decided on my birthday that I didn't want to go out because it would feel like facile or bubbly, and it wasn't really where I was at. I didn't want to go to some restaurant or something. I just wanted to invite people to my house where I have an [eaten <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201351\">on] couch now and a nice TV and like these very conventional comforts that are somehow pleasing to me, finally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">And so I just wanted to invite people over for board games or whatever. So I called her and I said, \"Yeah, so there's a party at my house. You want to come over?\" And she said, \"Yeah, sure. What time?\" I said, \"How about eight thirty?\" And she said, \"Good.\" And I said, \"Great. See you then.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">And my interpretation is that something in my voice is just taking her for granted, maybe a little too much. And also the two younger guys were listening in. I don't know. Maybe I came off too macho. That's the only way I can come up with explanations. But her text response is, \"Oh crap. Turns out I <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201391\">don't go to Dunmore because it's an hour away. Might not be up for traveling as long as I could hang out. Rain check in central a location? a\/k\/a I should return to (inaudible at 00:27:48).\" First of all that's not even -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">THERAPIST: a\/k\/a what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">CLIENT: grammatically correct.

You're taking something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201451\">has no relevance to whoever is in the room speaking. And you're inserting it in there. It's incredibly petty and it's like the opposite of (inaudible at 00:28:35).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">(inaudible) changes the whole course of a play. But a text message changes nothing, but it's still a complete intrusion, a non-sequitur and it's grammatically incorrect. And the point is she backed out. Either she senses that I just Basically in my mind she's just like a safety sex out there. Like <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201471\">at the end of my party or whatever. If I'm so disclosed I'll fuck her and that's it. That's my thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">And maybe that came through in my voice when I called her, like how I talked to her. (laughs) But in any case, she backed out of it. And not only did she back out of it but she said, \"Oh, I forgot, I don't go to Dunmore.\" And to me that's enough to get offended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">CLIENT: And I don't plan to interact with her again.

I just didn't What should I have said? \"Yes, you should call?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: I think you wanted to know why she reversed course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose it would have been sensible to engage her and talk to her and figure out what's going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">CLIENT: But she's putting it on me again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: She's putting it on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">CLIENT: She was like, \"Oh.\" And I was like, \"You bitch.\" I mean, you committed to this like twice or three times and then you tell me at the last minute, like an hour before hand, that you're not coming because you don't go to my shitty ass town. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, and I think in a way what's terrible for you in that situation, and I mean that by terrible, is that you still, you feel hurt by that. But you feel like rejected and you don't want to because she just did something to kind of like affront you. And yet you still kind of feel, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201691\">was thinking, almost to show that you're pissed off or that you're upset or offended and to tell her would be to admit too much, to give too much to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's like, I don't know. I'm going to have this experience multiple times, but it's like we have this conversation and things make sense. And then there's another conversation and, okay, she interested in coming and things make sense, and then there's this other conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B1\">that comes out of nowhere. And it's like none of the previous conversations exist any longer and this person's like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">You know, I'm basically what I'm saying is in these previous conversations. And this person's asking for shit from me like saying, \"I want her to be there.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: I don't know what she's asking. But it's like your gears don't line up. But it doesn't I mean the language she's speaking in, and Danielle as well, the language she's speaking in these later conversations is just like it's not lining up. It's not lining up. And I don't know. I'm not going <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201711\">to meet that. I don't the strength, I guess, to meet that new gear that completely forgot about everything previous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: No, right. And the other thing is that, I was thinking about that, it also kind of If you were to kind of get upset or to say something back, it's again more exposing that kind of need, a desire. Some way that you're not the tough guy, you can just play the game, but feel something for <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201731\">them. And I was thinking in some way to kind of cut her off in some way, well it's protective in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20172-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20172-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">CLIENT: And I guess from my point of view, what do I stand to gain? I hear what you're saying and I have too sort of the desire not to be vulnerable.

Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20185\">CLIENT: And you're asking me to explain what the problem is here. You know, I'm being completely courteous in saying to her, \"Let me know if I can clear anything up.\" But what more does she want? I'm not even talking sense. I don't know what I'm saying, but I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20187\">THERAPIST: No. I think you It seems to me like you're implying was she having thoughts about the way your tone was with her, or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B\">THERAPIST: And almost, you know, I was thinking like asking her to kind of say something about how she's feeling. Like, \"You put some skin in the game. You tell me a little bit about, 'that hurt me,\" or something like that.\" Or, \"I feel like maybe you just want me for sex.\" But she didn't do that. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018B1\">wanted, almost like she was just sort of saying \"I'm going to play it like you don't really \" You know, I'm not going to let myself be vulnerable and go all the way out to Dunmore just, you know \"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">CLIENT: Yeah. to me it also seemed like she wanted to It's difficult to disentangle because the grammar was so bad, but I guess she also wanted to imply that she had something else to do that night and she would only be able to stay an hour. Which probably wasn't true. Or if it was true, from my point <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D1\">of view, what she was trying to do was say like, \"Okay, well I have other stuff to do tonight too,\" just so I would get the impression that she's, you know, more important than me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">THERAPIST: \"I don't need this so bad.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yeah. You'll get an hour and that's it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">CLIENT: But in her case, knowing her, I think it was a design to impress me that backfired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">THERAPIST: You know, just to say something too, in thinking about how strongly you felt about reading the text messages to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">THERAPIST: What about that? What was getting -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">CLIENT: It's like a real loser move, just to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Really? Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A1\">CLIENT: It's not true. Like when Edgar shows me his text messages it's fine. I guess I've gotten used to it. Four years ago I was just shocked. This guy in Portland he's like talking to me about this Chinese woman that he knew, and he's a delegate for the election, so he's going to decide whether it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A11\">Hilary Clinton or Barack Obama.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A3\">And Hilary Clinton is definitely going to win. And he knows these Chinese woman that is very influential in China and she works for CNN in China, and here's her voice-mail. Here, listen to this voice-mail that she left me. And it's just like so desperate. I don't know. It's like, \"What does this have <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201A31\">to do with me?\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N201A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">CLIENT: I don't know. It's trying to pull someone into your I don't know what it is. It's not pretty though. It's unseemly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Unseemly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">CLIENT: So that's part of my reaction. The other part, of course, is just frustration with this bitch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">CLIENT: It's just like she's weak and she doesn't want to get hurt and then she ends up hurting me because of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">CLIENT: And meanwhile she's doing that to other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that's right. And I was just thinking why, yeah, this feels like wanting me to hear about the text message feels like another kind of raw area, a vulnerable area for you. And, again, it's like, what's the outcome of that? Am I going to see it as a loser move? You know, you experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201B51\">it as a loser move. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. In my own arrogant interpretation though it's like fear of judgment doesn't even go into it. It's like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">CLIENT: It's quite possible it is, you know, I'm afraid of how you interpret it. But it my mind it's just me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">CLIENT: I don't like to be that guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C1\">THERAPIST: Yes, yeah. And what it feels like to be that guy to you. What I mean by that is, you know like, \"God damn. You know? If I have to What am I going to do? Beg this girl to come out to Dunmore?\" You know, that kind of thing. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. And needing it too. You know, especially by the end of the week I'm needing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C5\">THERAPIST: It's your birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C7\">CLIENT: But needing it is, you know, (laughs) need isn't a good way to get things for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Ah. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CB\">CLIENT: As far as I can tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CD\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF\">CLIENT: Also I got this birthday card. Birthday card from my mother [plus a gift] (ph). It came in the mail just like two days ago. It's a book and I haven't opened it, but it's in Saran (ph) and it says on the cover in big white letters on black, \"Life isn't about finding yourself, it's about creating <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201CF1\">yourself.\" And there's also a card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D1\">And at first I just told myself I shouldn't open it because, honestly, (laughs) you know I was probably drinking at the time. And I said something like, you know, \"Nothing good could come of it.\" And I was like, \"There's nothing good that could come out of reading this card.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D5\">CLIENT: You know, there's just nothing good. So if it's not good -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Why open it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201D9\">CLIENT: You know, I was talking to the owner of the bike shop about brakes. And we were draining a hydraulic brake. And the perfect brake has no air in it. And we got to a point where it felt really good, but he wanted to keep going and then the brake is not as good. You know, bar three pumps the brake <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201D91\">where it should be bar two and it will like lock real tight. But we kept going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DB\">And so I was saying, you know, \"The perfect brake has no air in it. You can only possibly make it worse by trying to fix or improve it. You can only let air in.\" You know? And that's how I felt about the letter too. It's like, there's no possible way that this message could make me, like improve my life. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DD\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201DF\">CLIENT: It's just there's no way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E1\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E3\">CLIENT: And even with the book, it's like it's annoying like that with my mother. Like the book, I believe, what it says, you know, \"Life isn't about finding yourself it's about creating yourself.\" I felt like I have been creating myself. You know, I felt I actually recognized last night that there's <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201E31\">been a (inaudible at 00:41:22) as a trustee in the meet (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201E2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201E2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E7\">CLIENT: And that's somewhat exceptional. You know? As far as (inaudible) revitalization and stuff. And I may be involved in it and whatever, but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB\">CLIENT: Concerns about my (inaudible at 00:41:46), you know, I feel like I have been creating myself. You know, I've been working at that and here comes this book. And it's advising me to do what I've been doing. And it's close to being snarked (ph) in some way. You know, I've cut off contact with her <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201EB1\">so, I don't know. But in the same way, I don't think my gears can line up with my mother. Like she's always someplace different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201ED\">And the thing the letter did when I finally did open it is it confirmed every single thing I've been trying to avoid. It's like, you know, after a while. I talked to someone else about not talking to my family, and after a while it's kind of like when your foots asleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201EF\">Like the limb is there, you're still connected to your family, they've raised you, they know who you are, you know who they are. There are still all these interactions and your constant, whatever. It's still there and it's a part of you but you're not getting signals from the limb. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F3\">CLIENT: So you're kind of hobbling around and you're wondering, \"Why am I not getting signals from this limb.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F7\">CLIENT: Or, \"Is this really sensible.\" Or you forget why you sort of cut off contact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB\">CLIENT: It's just sort of like a stricture that you've got in your life. Like a fast too. Or anything that requires discipline. (inaudible at 00:43:17) And you get halfway through and you wonder why you're doing it. But the letter confirmed basically everything. (laughs) Everything I was avoiding is <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201FB1\">exactly what I thought it was and it's justified to avoid it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD\">And the letter it said like, \"Brandon, happy birthday.\" Who knows, a loving message. But it also said, \"We took care of this insurance claim for you and paid off parking tickets that you accrued in Baltimore,\" and all that stuff, \"Love, Mom.\" And it's like and then it had a hundred dollar check in it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201FD1\">So it was like cleaning up my mess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20201\">CLIENT: And I've been worried about the insurance claim, I just hadn't gotten to it because I've been very busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20203\">THERAPIST: Oh, the car insurance claim?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20205\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But combined with being sort of a prot g to the owner, I felt sort of off guard. Like I felt like I was sort of grabbing, you know, if life was a chicken I was grabbing it by the neck. And I sort of released when I read the letter because it's just, I don't know. What are you supposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202051\">to do? I guess I'm sort of <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20207\">THERAPIST: What did you feel about the paying off the claim and the parking tickets?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20209\">CLIENT: I mean I was partly relieved. I felt a relief for the stress that was on me. And I felt confirmed in not really speaking to my family. And I mean it was just a little embarrassing, but I don't know. I don't know if I felt that. I suddenly just felt relieved and I felt angry at being relieved of this stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Ah. Huh. Yeah. The cleaning up your mess and we're doing this. That they did it for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2020D\">CLIENT: It's like licking (ph) my face. yeah.

But I thought of, well, she would be telling my extended family how she, \"Well, Brandon got this insurance claim and they were bothering us and <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202111\">we had to pay it off for him.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20213\">THERAPIST: Yup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20215\">CLIENT: It makes any return to connection to them that much harder because they're not going to be able to respect me as a self And maybe I'm not completely there yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20217\">THERAPIST: That's right. That's right. Just something about it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20219\">CLIENT: Self-sufficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and that to not be self-sufficient and to have these kind of like these messes or something, means is very much equated with some loss of stature, standing, respect for your life. And then it opens the door for her to say things like, well, kind of suggesting, \"Hey, here's what you <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2021B1\">should be doing. You should be creating your life not searching for meaning.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And also I don't think they know No, they know. Well they might have some idea that I'm fixing bikes but, yeah, she's just picturing me as wiling away my time -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2021F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20221\">CLIENT: like she does probably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20223\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20225\">CLIENT: You know, looking for something more. I mean, oh my gosh. I mean, It's just there's no A meeting with her Well, like I may see her but the prospect of her actually understanding where I am is more remote than ever (ph) now. And also the last thing is, I've been enjoying my job but I've started <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202251\">to have like something creeping like I've been very tired after work. And I want to make very, very good use of the summer because I get to rest in the winter and also there's a lot I can be doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20226\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20227\">I want to build up to going to school for classics in Baltimore. And there's a lot I need to do to accomplish that financially and, mostly financially. (laughs) But I've been enjoying this work but I'm only making twelve dollars an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20228\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20229\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022B\">CLIENT: The other stuff is lucrative but I'm often very tired when I get home. But when I'm fixing bikes I charge twenty five dollars an hour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022D\">THERAPIST: Mm. So yeah. Do you get work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2022E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2022F\">CLIENT: Well I have work. I don't know if I still will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20230\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20231\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20233\">CLIENT: I deliver groceries too but it needs to pick up a lot. Anyway, there is all this other interesting stuff going on. My work sort of, I'm sort of pushing that aside, like the insurance claim and stuff that I just sort of sweep. And I wonder whether I should be looking for a job at an advertising <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202331\">agency or something like that would serve me. I guess I have that problem of the guy looking at a bike. I mean I have all these problems and, you know, which one do I fix? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20235\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20237\">*; One day I'll think I should do that, but one day I'll think I'll think I should this thing and (inaudible at 00:49:15). It's hard to pick one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20239\">THERAPIST: I see what you're saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023B\">CLIENT: And it's not certain that I'd be able fix anything if I did pick one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023D\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023F\">CLIENT: Like getting a job at an ad agency. Because I'm convinced I could do at an agency just what I did at the mechanic shop. I mean I'm already someone that they go to to fix their bikes and I didn't even know anything five weeks ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N2023E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2023E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559975\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20241\">THERAPIST: There's a lot you do.
