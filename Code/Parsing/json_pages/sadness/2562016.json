My lightweight wool blazer was just not cutting it anymore. (pause) I was running late because I didn\u2019t want to get out of the nice hot shower, and so I begrudged myself the time it would take to lace up my boots. (pause) Sorry. [1:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Happy 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Happy 2014. Sorry about last week. They didn\u2019t plow my road so [inaudible] that I had gotten stuck on ice in Maine over break and needed to be towed. I was like do I really want to drive on [inaudible] Road? No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Maybe not, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, that was exciting. We went up to Maine for vacation. One of Dave\u2019s colleagues owns\u2026 she calls it a cabin, but it\u2019s really like a really nicely furnished house, but cabin up in the mountains in Bar Harbor, Maine. [2:08] And so\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Sorry, where, northeastern Maine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Bar Harbor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh, Bar Harbor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is in northeastern Maine. And so we had checked the weather reports and the weather report\u2019s forecast light snow, not expecting anything to stick, nice warm temperatures. So we decided to drive. Rather than blow $800 bucks for renting a Jeep we would just take my car. And how\u2026 we <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">got there and it started snowing really hard. We were a half hour out from the cabin, and the cabin was on the top of the mountain. It was a 30 degree incline and on a dirt road. It wasn\u2019t paved, which no one warned us about. And with the snow and the ice and the slush, the car just couldn\u2019t do it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">We started slipping on ice and not making forward progress halfway up the mountain, far enough up that there is really no good thing to do [inaudible]. So we tried backing down, like back to the highway, and lost control on the ice and well, went straight into a snow bank so we weren\u2019t out of control <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">for very long. Then we were just not going anywhere in any direction anymore. [3:20] And by that point it was 10:30 at night. We\u2019re in rural Maine. David\u2019s like let\u2019s just knock on someone\u2019s door. And I was like at 10:30 at night in rural America, in the same country where four people of color [ph] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">have been shot to death for knocking on doors or held up after getting into car accidents in the last two months? No, we\u2019re just going to walk to the cabin. So we did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: How far a walk was it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: About two miles, a little over two. But it was a very high grade and snow and ice in the dark with no flashlight. But there was a full moon so it was okay. Dave thinks I\u2019m ridiculous for having been afraid of bodily harm from knocking on stranger\u2019s doors. [4:04] (pause) But the way I saw it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">we had Gore-tex boots and flannel lined, or fleece lined, jeans and good sturdy jackets and gloves and hats. And so we weren\u2019t really in any danger from the weather. And neither of us are very experienced winter hikers, but we\u2019ve both done winter outdoors and safety classes, have gone on a couple of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">actual backpacking trips in snow and ice, so I wasn\u2019t too worried about\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah, a 45 minute walk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. On a road not on backwoods trail. I mean a dirt road but still a road. Yeah, I wasn\u2019t\u2026 Dave was like what if you had slipped and broken your leg? Well, then you would\u2019ve had to ring a doorbell. [5:05] But it was good. We got to the cabin and the next morning called a tow truck to tow our <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">car up to the cabin. And then we had made plans to go to a couple of art galleries and maybe do some cross country skiing and some snowshoeing, but the roads were still really treacherous and we weren\u2019t sure we could get down and back up the mountain a couple of times, so we\u2019re like let\u2019s just stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200252\">in the cabin. So we walked around the owner\u2019s property a little bit. Mostly just sat in front of the fire and drank our body weight in hot chocolate and [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562016\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: So who was there? Was it just the two of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, just the two of us. The colleague who owns the cabin was somewhere warm. She was with her grandkids. (pause) Yeah, it was nice. [6:12] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Even that wasn\u2019t so bad. (pause) So yeah, other stuff. Work is still really slow. We still don\u2019t have work to do. I\u2019m still fighting with myself to stay focused on reading and professional development, and that\u2019s really hard and really frustrating. [7:18] I\u2019m terrified of performance reviews, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">which are coming up in another couple of weeks. (pause) And I still miss Ashley, which is ridiculous. (pause) So the monthly singing event is this Sunday. [9:06] And Ashley introduced me to singing. I mean I guess in my church choir we had some pieces before but not in the style that this singing is <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D2\">done, if that makes any sense. So there\u2019s written music for all of the pieces, and you can perform it in traditional Anglican choral fashion, but the way it\u2019s done in this group is very different in style. So Ashley introduced me to\u2026 this style to me even though I saw the music before. But yeah, I really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D3\">enjoy this singing. I really like the group that meets on the second Sunday of the month in [inaudible] but that was our standing date night. Even if schedules didn\u2019t line up and we didn\u2019t do anything else that month, we would go to singing together and spend the night together. So I don\u2019t know if I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D4\">want to go. I fear awkwardness. [10:14] The last time I saw Ashley after the breakup it was\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Was that delivering the food?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, and the [inaudible] uncomfortable hug and\u2026 but I mean I quit dancing entirely after I told Tom I didn\u2019t want him in my life anymore because\u2026 terrified of running into him at dancing events. And I don\u2019t want to lose another thing that I enjoy doing, especially because Ashley didn\u2019t do anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">particularly wrong. Well I mean I guess not caring that your partner\u2019s depressed to the point of being suicidal is a wrong thing to do. [11:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: He wasn\u2019t harassing or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. I was going to say it\u2019s a sin of omission rather than a sin of commission. (pause) I miss him and I wish we were still together, even though that wasn\u2019t making me very happy. And I hate the fact that I\u2019m being irrational about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You mean by missing him knowing that you weren\u2019t happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess you\u2019re just not doing well enough at any of this post Ashley work. [14:36]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: What do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) you\u2019re worried about your performance review, which I imagine derives partly from a sense that you have of not doing well or not. You sound worried about not being focused enough on that professional development stuff. You\u2019re mad at yourself for irrationally missing Ashley, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">which sounds like [inaudible] of your performance maybe. I guess those were the things I had in mind. [15:30] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562016\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: I was talking to one of Ashley\u2019s other exes, Katie, the other day. [16:43] Katie is the person I have lots of history with. We went to college together, didn\u2019t like each other, didn\u2019t speak to each other for years. But Katie\u2019s best friends with my good friend Lo, so I made efforts to\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s not Lori.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes, Lori, sorry. Lo is an old nickname.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Lo or Lou?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: Lo, L-O. But yeah, I\u2019ve been making an effort for Lori\u2019s\u2026 to reach out to Katie and at least resolve some of the latent hostility between us. But anyway, Katie also\u2026 Katie dated Ashley for seven years and so I\u2019m\u2026 I was talking to Katie about something to do with Lori\u2019s next visit to Providence <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">and scheduling dinner, whatever, and she asked what happened with Ashley. And so I told her most of it, pretty unvarnished. And she thinks that I completely misread the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: In what way? [17:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: She thinks that Ashley liked and cared about me much more than I gave him credit for, that he\u2019s just bad at communicating, especially when he\u2019s depressed, and also that he masks his mental health issues to a very large extent. So she said based on some of the descriptions of things he said and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">did that he sounds much more depressed than he has been in the past, which I mean doesn\u2019t really excuse some of his behavior, but it does serve as a mitigating factor I guess. I mean I can be a huge jerk when I\u2019m in a bad downswing. I\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like this feeling of second guessing my <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200512\">decisions. (pause) But I don\u2019t usually second guess myself. [19:07] I mean I will waffle forever before making a decision, but once it\u2019s made I generally trust that I analyzed every possible aspect of the problem and move on. So it\u2019s not completely unprecedented but certainly unusual and also unpleasant <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200513\">to have this feeling of maybe I made the wrong call here. (pause) I mean maybe I did, maybe I didn\u2019t, but if I did there\u2019s nothing I can do about it now. You can\u2019t just un-breakup with someone. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m wondering whether\u2026 or how much of your not liking that feeling of second guessing yourself has to do with having been wrong possibly per se as opposed to wrong and sort of fallible as opposed to really content that if you\u2019re wrong it means maybe you\u2019d have been happier in a way. [20:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s probably easy and true to say they both Brett.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Right. (pause) So there\u2019s a part of me right now that\u2019s telling me I\u2019m ridiculous for wasting our time here going on and on about my romantic angst, that there are probably more important things to talk about. I feel a little self-conscious. [22:13]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not suggesting you may be going about this the wrong way as well, are you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I might be. (laugh) Again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, and [inaudible] to me there is\u2026 you\u2019re referring to feeling self-conscious, which I imagine is part of how you felt some of the other stuff as well. I don\u2019t\u2026 I think the sense that I\u2019m seeing it for\u2026 maybe you\u2019re more exposed, more vulnerable, more like you could really get on your <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F1\">case about it maybe. I don\u2019t think your immediate concern is that I\u2019m going to be so critical so much as you just feel kind of\u2026 you feel very ashamed to have me see you doing all these things wrong. [23:33]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562016\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So one really bad habit that I have, that\u2019s carried over from when I was 13, is my away status for IM, instant messenger and all that crap, are song lyrics. I will change my status to song lyrics. But it\u2019s sort of how I\u2019m thinking and feeling in the moment. So kind of be a [inaudible] <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">status indicator for people who know the songs that I like. Because I will rarely pick the lines that actually reflect my feelings, but something from the same song. But you kind of have to know the song to, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of passive aggressive and very childish of me. [25:21] There are some <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200612\">really perfect songs that sum up how I feel about Ashley and everything that happened. But I can\u2019t use any of them as my status anymore because I don\u2019t know if you are up on the feminist critique blogosphere or not, but a musician tried to host the songwriting retreat at a plantation where the plantation <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200613\">museum and the owner of the plantation kind of have a pro antebellum south, slavery wasn\u2019t so bad, why can\u2019t we all be friends sort of attitude towards the history of plantations. And she wanted to charge like $3000 for admission to the retreat workshop for pitching a tent on the lawn. Like bring your <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200614\">own tent even, not even like you get to stay in the plantation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, so as you can imagine some people who do critique of media figures for a living had some things to say and a bunch of my friends got really mad, and so I fear social refribation [sic] if I use her lyrics as my away message. [26:43] And that\u2019s a really silly thing to be upset about it. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">It\u2019s frustrating. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s something that is a way you\u2019d like to let some of your friends know how you\u2019re feeling. [28:06] (pause) I guess if I think about it again I [inaudible] there\u2019s just like a sense of vulnerability to other people that\u2019s kind of all over that. I mean both in that being a sort of nice <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">but also, I think, maybe a bit comfortable, indirect way of letting some of your friends know how you\u2019re doing, and also in your\u2026 worrying about so many people\u2019s judgments if you keep doing the songs. And then also as you\u2019re telling me about it, feeling like you\u2019re being silly for being upset about it. [30:09]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: I mean just to be clear, I don\u2019t approve of her decision there. I think she owes pretty much everyone an apology for that. And I\u2019m totally in agreement that I do not want to give her any more of my money, will no longer be buying her albums or buying tickets to her shows, but I don\u2019t know, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200691\">feel like there are certain areas of lefty [ph] and especially feminist thought where it\u2019s as a whole, as a community, we\u2019re really, really bad at separating an artist from the art. And sometimes those things can\u2019t be separated and sometimes a boycott is the right answer. I mean every artist does things <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200692\">I disagree with, and if I limited myself only to art produced by artists who meet some litmus test of social and political acceptability, I would never consume art at all, right.

(pause) But I do feel like sometimes my social circles go too far, and this particular high profile outrageous and terrible but you must never listen to this person\u2019s music or discuss her ever again except in terms of what a horrible human being she is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And if you still enjoy her music you\u2019re bad.

(pause) But now I thought I would stop feeling so crappy about breaking up with Ashley. It\u2019s been a month, and I went on this great vacation with Dave. I still feel like crap. And my feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">crap kind of cast a shadow over vacation. It didn\u2019t ruin it or anything but I spent more time moping than I otherwise would have.

The whole point of breaking up with him was that I could stop being upset about him.
