Nothing really new with me. Just still like I feel like happier and more energetic. I can see like people picking up on that. I like have always had like a social anxiety, and I felt like others like wouldn\u2019t approach me, and now I kinda just approach them and talk to them. You know, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">just like more social than I\u2019ve been. And I noticed that like I\u2019m building more friendships than I did before. It\u2019s weird. And like people can\u2014people are more I guess like attracted to those that are happy than those that seem like they\u2019re unhappy and like\u2014I don\u2019t know. I notice that, like people are <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200272\">more attracted to me, and like engaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Hm.

I just\u2014I think I\u2019m distancing myself more. So we\u2019ll see what happens. More like [that I\u2019m learning\/wanting? 3:10] to like not push things, just like analyzing how he is with like a change in my behavior. It\u2019s weird. I can see like where we\u2019re more different, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">how like I don\u2019t know if something\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m not sure if I think we should be together because of what we both want. I think he\u2019s just like comfortable with who he is and he\u2019s always going to be there. I don\u2019t know, I just want more. And I\u2019m just seeing if like either he gives me more, or I\u2019m just going <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F2\">to move on. At this point I\u2019m just tired. [4:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Well, what would more look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Just more like attention. And like affection. Like last night we kissed and he was looking at the TV. And he was like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a good movie.\u201d And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s so wrong. Like got to be more like affection. He just was like in his own little world, and just like he\u2019s okay with that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">It\u2019s weird. To me it\u2019s weird. I didn\u2019t notice it, I thought it was like\u2014I thought it was because of me like he was that way. But it\u2019s not, that\u2019s just like who he is. So I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re taking it far less personally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I thought it was something I did for him to be like that. And I\u2019m like, \u201cNope, he\u2019s just\u2014that\u2019s him.\u201d And I never noticed it before. Like when we first started going out I think it was more me. Like I would call him, and I would do\u2014you know, do things. I would be more to like go <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200471\">and try and kiss him, or comfort him, where it\u2019s like not both. I mean, like he\u2019d participate or whatever, but it was me that like always made the first move. And\u2014I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want that anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561080\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: But he\u2019s just\u2014he\u2019s seen a difference in me, he saw like I\u2019m happier. And he thinks it\u2019s weird, a little bit. He\u2019s confused by like the change in my behavior. [6:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: He thinks it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re happier?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: He\u2019s confused by everything. He\u2019s confused on how I react. Like I\u2019m like I come home late, and I don\u2019t call him if I\u2019m at work. I had like four days of hell at work, and like I did doubles and I got mandated, and I probably did like 40 hours in like three days. So like I would go to work and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">I\u2019d come home. And he was more the one where, \u201cYou said you were going to be home but you\u2019re not home.\u201d And it\u2019s like that\u2019s what I was like with him, and now I\u2019m like\u2014I\u2019m just not focused on the relationship as much. I think he\u2019s picking up on it. It\u2019s taken him a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">But he\u2019s said like, oh, I usually will overact, and I don\u2019t. And I\u2019m able to like tell him how I\u2019m feeling without like getting wicked emotional. And I told him, I\u2019m like, it\u2019s ten months, and we can\u2019t just continue this relationship like this. And he\u2019s like, \u201cI understand why you\u2019re saying that.\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">was like, \u201cWell, don\u2019t you want more for us? Don\u2019t you want more?\u201d And he said he does. Like he wants more for like his self, and like his education and everything. But I just\u2014I don\u2019t see him doing anything. And that\u2019s like what bothers me. Because I feel like we\u2019re at different levels in our life. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200512\">It doesn\u2019t mean like we\u2019re not going to be together, but I just think like in ten months that we should like move out and see if this is like really what we want. I haven\u2019t told him I\u2019m thinking like that, but I\u2019ve like hinted at it. And it kinda\u2014it makes me happy to feel like this doesn\u2019t have to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200513\">my life. I feel like a relief. [8:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: That you have choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s not so dire and doom laden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just\u2014I can\u2019t my life with somebody that doesn\u2019t try as hard as I\u2019m trying. And I just\u2014I really feel like neglected in this relationship. And I still do. And there\u2019s reasons for it, you know. And I thought it was like me making it up in my head. But no. Like it\u2019s just not working. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">it\u2019s okay. You know. But if he changes like in ten months, puts more effort, is more affectionate, like I guess I could change my mind. But right now I just don\u2019t see it. I mean, that makes sense, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: What do you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re wanting my feedback on it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Like you want my feedback like does it sound reasonable? Or\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Do I feel like\u2014am I overreacting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: I see, that\u2019s the question, you\u2019re worried you\u2019re overreacting about his behavior?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: About\u2014yeah. Like if your needs aren\u2019t met in a relationship, like are you really supposed to sacrifice this much? [10:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Hm. So you\u2019re sort of thinking or maybe concerned about are you asking for too much? Is this an okay reason to walk away from the relationship? Are you not compromising enough? Is that kind of what you\u2019re concern\u2014 I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like if you\u2019re not happy, you\u2019re not happy, right? Or is just going happen like in every relationship I have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: The thing that I feel\u2014the way in which I could be most helpful to you is for you to have\u2014 [phone rings] Sorry about this. \u2014for you to have confidence in your decision, whatever decision you make.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561080\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Because it\u2019s certainly not up to me, or really to anyone, to tell you what you should or shouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate, put up with, what it is that you ultimately need or want. You\u2019re the only person who can determine that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: And it sounds like you\u2019re feeling\u2014you\u2019re certainly having clarity, but then a little bit of anxiety about what\u2014you know, sort of whether the\u2014sort of happy to have an end in terms and seeing if he\u2019s going to change, and if not not to stay in it. Sort of you\u2019re feeling a little bit insecure about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s going to take time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: And I think like there\u2019s still hope there, like that he will change, whatever. Like I just\u2014I don\u2019t want this to be a pattern if I like get in another relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: When you say this could be a pattern, what\u2019s this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Like I did this in the last relationship. Like I gave everything to that person, and like instead of like, you know, just caring about myself I cared about them. You know. And I feel like I did this with Steve, like I just gave and gave and gave. And like he like that, that helped him, but there <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">was nothing like going in my direction. Like am I going to do this again? Or like I just seem to like not take care of me, but I take care of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: In the hopes that they would take care of you? [12:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: I just feel like it could be like a mutual thing, you know. So. And I feel like I\u2019m like in the same relationship I was before. I mean, they\u2019re different people, they have different personalities, but they\u2019re both single, like the only child, broken home, pretty selbike. And like I would just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">financially help them, and emotionally help them. And if I felt like, you know, like that should have\u2014it should go both ways, and I was never at the other end. So like Steve\u2019s a much sweeter person than my last boyfriend, but I feel like it\u2019s the same relationship. So. It\u2019s like why do I keep going <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200852\">out with these people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you\u2019ve been going to a dry well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, like after this I think I\u2019ve learned. Like I don\u2019t know. I guess I was like feeling like\u2014I just always wanted to\u2014like I\u2019m very caring, and I care about the person, that person for like, you know, that they are, care for them. But like I just wasn\u2019t caring about myself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200891\">I mean, giving everything to them in person and not taking care of yourself. Like I don\u2019t know why I did that. Like I would sacrifice like my happiness for the other person. And that doesn\u2019t work. Because then you just end up resenting them and being unhappy. Like I\u2019m trying to find somebody that would <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200892\">do the same for me. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I want. And I mean like Steve tries, he tries so hard. But he\u2019s just in a situation where like he\u2019s unhappy, and he like isn\u2019t doing anything about it still. He like helps me, like he helps me with the house and stuff like that.

It\u2019s sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">CLIENT: And it\u2019s sad because like\u2014I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t change it, I can\u2019t help him. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever like help his self. And his father was kinda like that too. His father smoked weed and like seemed to give up on life. That\u2019s why his mother like left him. He just was so laid back, or didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F1\">have like any care for anything. He did his own thing. He was interested in computers, and videogames, and cars, and that\u2019s it. So like it sounds like he\u2019s his father. [37:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s too bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">CLIENT: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like you\u2019re grieving him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, I had a relationship for a couple years and everything was great. [pause] I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you have some good theories as to what may have happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">CLIENT: [It\u2019s just that? 37:53], yup. I don\u2019t know, does that mean I should give up? I just don\u2019t know what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Give up because you feel like this is kind of how it\u2019s gonna be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yeah. This morning he surprised me though when I was like\u2014he watching TV, so I went in the bathroom and I just played my music and I was just singing and dancing. And it took him about like, I don\u2019t know, an hour to like notice I was even there. And then he came over. He does like he\u2019d come <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F1\">over to the bathroom, say something, and like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no cream,\u201d or something, I don\u2019t know. It was stupid stuff. But he finally tried to like\u2014grabbed me and pulled me to him, and he like ended up hitting my knee on the door. And I was just like, okay. And he felt so bad. And then like later on <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F2\">he was like\u2014when I was leaving he was affectionate, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I have to go.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, this is our day off together.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, you wait too long. Like I was here all day for like, I don\u2019t know, five hours before I had to leave and you just started <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F3\">seeing me then.\u201d It\u2019s weird.

Like it\u2019s too late?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: No, like we could have spent time with each other. And now before I\u2019m leaving you want to spend time with me. It makes no sense. [pause] I don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019m not perfect, you know. At least I\u2019m trying. [40:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">THERAPIST: It just seems like your grieving something so deep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">CLIENT: No, it\u2019s just hard. You know, you spend your life with somebody for like five years. And you [like have belonged to that? 40:17] for like eleven or twelve. And like I don\u2019t [have anyone?]. And you feel like you can\u2019t connect with them. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because he\u2019s working so much, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201271\">and I\u2019m working so much. But like all it does is take like two seconds. And he could text me the most loveliest things, the sweetest things in the world, and then when he got home he doesn\u2019t act like that. It\u2019s like he can tell me how he feels in a text, but he can\u2019t tell me how he feels like when I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201272\">next to him. So it\u2019s very confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: But the text would have been enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: No. Like I want him to spend time with me and actually like be there. In a text you\u2019re like not there. It\u2019s weird. He like sort of disconnected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: And it leaves you feeling very deprived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I feel wicked neglected. And it\u2019s like\u2014I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pretty blunt. I\u2019m pretty straightforward. Like I will tell him like, \u201cThis is what\u2019s upsetting me, this is what I need. Can you do this?\u201d And he\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah.\u201d But he\u2019ll never do it. And I\u2019m like, okay. So that gives me hope, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F1\">then I get disappointed. So it\u2019s like this is just like a cycle. I don\u2019t know. I feel strong enough\u2014like this relationship has beaten\u2014like beat me down. Where like I felt insecure because like he wasn\u2019t attracted to me. And I felt like I was working for us, and giving like myself to this. So I wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F2\">taking care of myself, I didn\u2019t even care about myself anymore. Now I feel like I care about myself, I love myself. I want to do what\u2019s right for myself and make the right decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Well, we\u2019re going to need to stop in a moment, but it does seem like you\u2019re trying very hard to figure things out for yourself, and I think that\u2019s a very good thing.
