Yeah, I am alright. (pause) [What did I want to say?] (ph) I am wary of my (pause) eagerness or propensity today to dip into fantasy and I am trying to figure out why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Mm. Different today than other days? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Well, yes and no. I mean today I am seeing you and that is always a It is kind of like a high point for me and so I don\u2019t know if it is It is almost like I wonder if I can make it through the day without leaping at the opportunity to jump into fantasy. And I know that there are things during <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">the day that might be challenging. This could be one of them, for example. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But, yeah, today is I don\u2019t know why today is more Actually, maybe I do have an idea. I have been working on this website now for about a week. It has to do with the work I was doing overseas. And, you know, I was delighted last week when I was finally able to connect a web address to actual content <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">that I was putting on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">So (inaudible at 00:02:44) is now the site (inaudible) and there is a lot of good content on there now. And, you know, I kind of had this great idea on Tuesday, Wednesday. And you know, I got so far on it and then I kind of (pause) I guess with anything, I kind of got to this point where I got stuck. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">And then it is like suddenly like, \u201cWell, is this worth it?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">Is this part of the scope of the project? Should I really be spending my time with this? So I kind of got to a point where I was just feeling negative about it. I didn\u2019t touch it yesterday and I haven\u2019t touched it yet today. And, you know, I think that is kind of the I hate to say it but it is kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">of a pattern for me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: The pattern of getting conflicted about something and then leaving it, dropping it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Being challenged by it. You know? And, you know (pause) it may be a brilliant idea, maybe well within the scope. And I think it actually probably is. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: There is a lot going through my mind right now, but I think the driving force for me to doing this thing was to proceed with it and not know where it is going to end up, not know how it is going to end. But just proceed with it because it is the right thing to do. It is the thing I want to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">It is putting it out there for people\u2019s consumption or complete oblivion, you know, obliviousness to it. And I am (pause) (sigh) You know, I don\u2019t know why I am in the mood of making generalizations today but it seems as though, my thinking lately has been that I have been preoccupied with what other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">people will value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">And as I said, I am not I am doing this and I am plowing through it with this kind of mantra of, \u201cJust do it because you don\u2019t where it is going to end. You don\u2019t know what it is going to look like.\u201d How there have been things that have been wildly successful in the past that I have done that I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">know where they were going to end up. And so back to where I started. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I guess I think the tendency is for me to see these challenges and be flustered and lose confidence and feel like I have lost my mooring and I\u2019m not sure where I am going. And yet it is just the same stuff that I have to plow through on another day. So, yeah, I think I am just feeling like I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">am suddenly lost where before I was very much moving in one direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561853\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: So feeling lost is what makes you feel like you are more likely to use fantasy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: I think so. I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: So what would you do to change the pattern? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Well I think I just have to get back into it because I know that works. I know, you know, picking up the guitar when I don\u2019t want to works. It moves forward. Albeit, perhaps it moves in a different direction than I anticipated but it is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: But it is the movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: It is movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: And that is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, I think it is the (laughs) thrill of the new idea that gets so, is so cherished that the movement isn\u2019t It seems like a bad thing. Whereas, the movement I think is the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, the new idea is the catalyst.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: But the movement really actually keeps it alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I am just in awe of, you know, well the love at first sight kind of a thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">(very long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: I have been noticing this week that structure has been helping me. Getting a certain amount done on this project each day has been helpful. It has been helpful in kind of making me feel like my day is not wasted. (sigh) I worked a lot on my Dad\u2019s letter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Do you want to talk about the letter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I guess that is why I sent it to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: You sound so enthused. (laughs) So invested. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah, you know, it is the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I thought there was probably a reason behind making sure that I saw it before you arrived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (laughs) Just so you know I wasn\u2019t slacking off on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: No, I (sigh) You know, again, it is the luster of the original idea is sort of long gone on this one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: And movement just seems so dull and plodding along. So, yeah, I mean I think what I was able to put in there was kind of quick and covered a lot of the perspective that I have kind of now arrived at, with your help of course. I\u2019ll make sure to give you credit in there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t have to quote. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: No, no, no. (laughs) I don\u2019t put any footnotes or bibliography or cited research. But, you know, the idea that this is not a punishing letter, this is a living letter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: I think that comes through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) As I read I had to kind of like push down [the beginning of the letter] (ph) before. And so I have put this chunk in there. And it is like, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you [could depart] (ph) before my \u201cOh my God, this is really, really unpleasant, the old intro. And it wasn\u2019t like lashing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200671\">out but it certainly didn\u2019t have the kind of the rational and compassionate frame that I am trying to introduce. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I think that the reiterations of it really highlight that the writing of the letter and processing it in new ways is really your work. It is much less actually about what you end up sending him, if you end up sending it to him, and more about that is your process. I think that is your process <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">of learning to forgive him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, you are right.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561853\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Because I think that the compassion is really the piece that is about forgiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: That is what allows, I think, people to forgive. Having compassion is what allows us to forgive people for actions or words (ph) that we don\u2019t actually condone. It is not like you are saying what he did was okay, and that the way he responded and a lot of the lack of response is okay with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200711\">you. You are saying that I feel for you and your experience as a human being even though you did these things that I see as egregious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Mm hm. Yeah. And I think that the difference is when I forgave him when I was twelve, it was just a kneejerk response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. That was a twelve year old\u2019s version of forgiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: It is very different than You know, what you have the capacity to hold and understand as a twelve year old is different than what you have the capacity to hold and understand and let go of as an adult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so there was one part of that letter, that introduction that I It is a long introduction. It is more than an introduction. (laughs) But there was a part in there where I, you know, I need to allude to it later on about the significance of this forgiveness as opposed to me saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">\u201cI love you,\u201d to my Dad when I was twelve. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: And all those things. Because that forgiveness didn\u2019t really do anything. It just kind of muted a lot of heavy thinking and critique and pain. And so thus far that whole lifetime since then has been to me incomplete. It has been strained. It has been misaligned. And for so many years I never knew why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah, that carrying around that piece with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. And so I want to send this letter as is an official (laughs) A, I haven\u2019t got the word for it, but kind of an animation of forgiveness. (pause) Yeah. (pause) But that is as much as I have got right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, it is not a but. You said, \u201cbut that is all I have got right now.\u201d It was pretty substantial. It is a lot of work that you have put into it. A lot of thought and feeling and processing and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: The importance of it really shows in the level of, the detail at which you are using to describe how you feel and why you are sharing. It shows a lot of thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Careful thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: And I think that is what is in the I think I kind of give attribution to that in the part that I have in parentheses. Or I say, \u201cIt is because I have not been able to accept this for better or for worse, that I am able to [put this in it] (ph).\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah. To see it this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, Yeah. Sorry if I am (sigh) I just feel drained and it just kind of, again, when I was sitting out there -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: What happened as you were sitting out there? When did you get drained?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It seems like when I got on the bus to come down. You know, it is a different mode of living when you don\u2019t have to drive yourself. You know, you are just kind of being carted around and you kind of sit there. (yawns) I don\u2019t know. Maybe it is just this day has been draining. But, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200991\">yeah, I think just sitting on the comfy couch.

I can tell you that the selection we have out there, those are ones that haven\u2019t been complained about for being inappropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: So it is a limited selection of things -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: So no \u201cMaxim.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: because we don\u2019t want to offend anybody. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: But I fear at the same time we are often not entertaining anybody. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, there is that. Well you could have some new decorating ideas. So, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Maybe it is just the end of the week, it is Friday. I mean I am always here Friday but still it is, I don\u2019t know. I am just tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">(very long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know why I am somewhere else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Where would you like to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) Um. I laugh because the first thing that came to mind was, \u201cOn your lap.\u201d (laughs) I am sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: That is okay. It is an honest answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: What else can I tell you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess I have two questions. The first one is, what is the second thing that came to mind? And going back to the first thing that came to mind, then what? If you had what you wanted what would be next? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: There was no second thing that came to mind. (laughs) It was just my amusement of the instantaneousness of the first thing that came to mind. (laughs) Um. Well. You know, I (pause) I guess I would just want to hold you. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: What would that give you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: A thrill, some peace. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">THERAPIST: How? If I go back and read some of the letter that you had to your dad, as you were describing your daily experience of the feelings of anxiety that you carry with you, the heaviness in your chest, the constricted breathing, you know, the thoughts that you feel like you live with every day. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD1\">How are those alleviated by holding me or being in my lap? How do you connect those? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">CLIENT: I am not sure that I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">THERAPIST: I think it is interesting that you kind of make me or an object of another fantasy somehow a cure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause) Yeah. (pause) It is difficult to think about this because, on the one hand, it would be nice to know the connection. On the other hand, I do enjoy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Hm. So you are afraid if you figure out the connection it will go away?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (laughs) It is an honest answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">THERAPIST: I like honesty. It is the only thing that works in here. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">CLIENT: But if I think about it, and I want to think about it (pause) I guess it is the acceptance. It is more of what is communicated that is not even felt.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200EA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561853\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">THERAPIST: What do you mean, \u201ccommunicated and not felt?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">CLIENT: Well, that I am worth something. That I am valued. That I am attractive. That I am (pause) desirable. (pause) And so, I guess, with it all written out in my letter, those are all the things that I feel like I am not all day long. (sigh) But for whatever reason, my (pause) need for these things <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF1\">to be fulfilled by someone, something, that is a challenge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Ah, is that what puts me as the object of the fantasy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">CLIENT: Maybe. I mean you are also attractive. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: But I bet there are plenty of people out in the world that you can find attractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">CLIENT: Yeah. It could be. But at the same time there is not that kind of connection with other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">THERAPIST: That is probably the key difference is that you get, hope, that you have to get some of those things that you say you are looking for in our interaction without the fantasy piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yes. I mean I think -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">THERAPIST: The feeling of being accepted. Not being judged. Being seen as valuable. I mean those are all things that are absolutely true in the relationship that we do have. I do see you as valuable and I do accept you and I don\u2019t judge you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But it is that well-worn track, you know, where it is the attraction, it is the desirability that is what happened. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">THERAPIST: That the way that a person shows you that you are valuable and accepted is through a sexual relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean it can happen in other ways too but it is like the cheapest one and most successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: Like I can have a job offer in my mailbox when I go home, you know. And that would be (laughs), from many different places, you know that would be a thrill and a message of desirability in a different way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: Um. (pause) (sigh) But those things are hard to I mean you can\u2019t instigate those. You can apply for a job but, you know, it is must easier to just fantasize about your therapist and your many boots. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s alright. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: So, yeah, I mean it is -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: It is good you always come in on casual Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">CLIENT: Is that what it is? It is casual Friday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">CLIENT: Do you really have the casual Friday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">THERAPIST: Well, I kind of get to make whatever day I want the casual day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">THERAPIST: But I tend to give up on Friday. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">CLIENT: I would think every day would be casual day. You know, [this is what I want.] (ph) I mean with every client you could say, \u201cWell, today is my casual day.\u201d And they wouldn\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">CLIENT: Only if you see them twice in a week, right? (laughs) Something to think about. Yeah, I just I think it is that connection. It is that acceptance. It is also I can see it manifest itself in the, when I am on my computer with someone I will look at different social network sites, different <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B1\">kinds. And one is called SoundCloud. It is where I posted, you know, some music that I, you know, recorded. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">And you know, they have a little counter there. It is for how many times it has been listened to. And it has been at 69 for quite a while now. So I keep checking. It is like, \u201cHas anybody listened to my song.\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2012C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561853\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: And I don\u2019t have any real I mean my LinkedIn profile has been at the very, very bottom. But other than that there is no reason to go there. There is no cue, c-u-e. But, you know, there is that and then there is my Vimeo page which has all my videos. And I get daily e-mail that says, \u201cYour <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201311\">video was played three times in the past 24 hours.\u201d Or, \u201cYou still have 500 megabytes this week to upload stuff.\u201d You know? And, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any plays in the past 24 hours.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">And I will go to Facebook to see if anybody has replied or liked things that I said, never. I will go to Instagram and maybe post a photo and then look throughout the day to see who has liked my photo. Who has commented on it? Who can give me the feedback I am looking for? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: When you post, are you posting with the awareness that you are doing so to see the response you get? Or are you -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: I am. And I can see myself looking for the response. I can see myself going to that and checking that throughout the day, checking my inbox to see if anybody has commented, checking my inbox for any kind of e-mail that is like, \u201cThis is for you. This is for you. This is something that is not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B1\">from the magazine (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: You are looking for a personal connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And so I guess that is that personal connection that we have that I seek out. And I don\u2019t know quite how to understand that if it is a need of acceptance, of approval, of saying that \u201cYes, you take good pictures.\u201d Or, \u201cYes, you write good songs.\u201d Or, \u201cYes, you have \u201c <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: Well, you want someone to pay attention to you and say that they like you, proxy your stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah, basically, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: It is interesting because if we look back at some our conversations in other sessions, one of the things you talked about a few weeks ago was sort of almost the reluctance you have to directly seek out that kind of connection and approval. You know, kind of avoiding conversations with friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201451\">because you felt like you didn\u2019t care enough about what they were talking about to actually invest in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Or almost avoiding that trip up to Vermont or Montana or someplace cold, in order to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Because you weren\u2019t sure, \u201cWas I really going to enjoy this?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: And those are the avenues that you actually get real validation. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: Because a \u201clike\u201d on Facebook or a comment on Instagram or a response to your thing on Twitter or a view of your whatever. You know, any of those things are fleetingly felt and satisfying. Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20157\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20159\">THERAPIST: Because you were probably psyched when you got to 69 views of your song but now it is meaningless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Now it doesn\u2019t mean anything until it goes up to 70 or 71.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2015F\">CLIENT: Or a hundred. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: Because it will keep moving. Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20165\">THERAPIST: But when you actually did go up and spend time with your friend that probably lasted longer. You know, like the memory you have of her laughing over getting the truck out -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20167\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20169\">THERAPIST: that is going to actually stay with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D\">THERAPIST: But yet you often bar yourself from having those direct When was the last time you directly e-mailed somebody and said, \u201cHey, I just finished a song. Do you want to hear it?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2016C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2016C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561853\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: Or, \u201cHey do you want to get together and play?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: No, no. You are right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: So I wonder There is actually nothing wrong with seeking feedback, validation, connection. Those are very normal human urges. And you are certainly not the only person who is checking their Facebook and looking to see who liked whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: You don\u2019t do it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: Well, I am not talking about me. I\u2019m just saying you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: Generally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: You know, I don\u2019t think Facebook would be doing that well if you were the only person checking your status updates. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. (laughs) Facebook be damned. Yes, yes. So those are the cheap ways and they can be on my terms and I can instigate them when I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And nobody really knows you are doing it. Right? Nobody knows how often you are checking to see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">CLIENT: Yeah. That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">THERAPIST: People would really know if you e-mailed them directly to ask a question or share something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">CLIENT: Yeah. Or if you called somebody five times a day, \u201cHow are you doing? What is going on?\u201d (laughs) \u201cYou still at work? Oh, okay.\u201d But, yeah, yeah. I see what you mean. (pause) So what is it though? I mean is there an apparent absence of personal connection in my life generally that I seek these <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201871\">things out? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">THERAPIST: To whom do you feel really connected? Who really knows you and do you feel really connected to? (pause) Actually, can I ask you, by whom do you feel truly known? Let\u2019s start there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">CLIENT: Well, my wife to a point -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Ah. Truly known. Does that fit with, \u201cTo a point?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">CLIENT: No. Well, it is hard to say because these fantasies that I embark on, she doesn\u2019t know about those.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">CLIENT: And so to say, \u201ctruly known,\u201d does that mean all of the warts and calluses as well? I guess that depends on what (laughs) I view as truly known.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">THERAPIST: Mm. Are the fantasies the only piece you feel like she doesn\u2019t know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) Because I don\u2019t know what that means, \u201ctruly known.\u201d I guess that is the closest thing. I mean I guess you know more than she does. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">THERAPIST: Well certainly about that piece. Are there pieces you feel that she knows about you that I don\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">CLIENT: Probably. My sense of humor. (laughs) I don\u2019t know. [She\u2019s warming to that.] (ph) (pause) It is hard to say because it is like at this level of intimacy it is pretty limitless. So I can talk with you about anything. I can\u2019t talk with her about everything. So it is hard to say what you know and <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B1\">what she knows, the difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">CLIENT: Maybe that is it. Maybe that is the difference. Maybe that is a (inaudible at 00:39:19).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">THERAPIST: I think you are probably on to something. (pause) I think that is important because the desire you have to be accepted by me in other ways, I think that is sustained by your feeling that it is safer with me. You can talk about anything with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">THERAPIST: And you don\u2019t feel that level of safety with her or with anyone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">THERAPIST: It gives me a lot of power to be the sort of person who can validate you or accept you the most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">CLIENT: Mm hm. (pause) So how do I, use is maybe the wrong word, but how do I use that to my advantage so that I can (laughs) get through these I mean maybe it is just the way I do fantasies that I feel bad about them, I also feel guilty, I can\u2019t talk about them. I just don\u2019t want to talk about these <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB1\">things to my wife. It would kill her. (sigh) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201AA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561853\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Yet you also don\u2019t really want to give them up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">CLIENT: That is true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">THERAPIST: So those are two options. Right? There is the option of giving it up so it is not something you are hiding from her, or telling her about it so it is not something you are hiding from her. And I would love to come up with a third or fourth option. I haven\u2019t created it yet. I haven\u2019t found <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B11\">it yet. But you may be able to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">CLIENT: Well I guess it is Yeah. I mean, it is not feeling bad about them. To just see them as a natural defense mechanism. It is the, and that is probably the more sustainable option. (sigh) Well, yes and no. I mean I guess what I would like to do is address why they are. Going after them so that <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B31\">that being addressed I can try to deal with the cause. And if I guess (inaudible 00:42:08).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: So being able to discover sort of why you use them, why they come up, what makes them powerful. I think part of that is noticing when you jump to them. And, you know, in the past couple of sessions I have asked, \u201cWhen did you jump from there to fantasizing or from what we were talking about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B71\">to escaping into a fantasy. And I think being aware of that trigger in here and when it happens outside of here are your cues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: What are you seeking from doing it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I think the complicating factor is that I am feeling worthless, feeling a lack of connection, jumping into fantasy. Feeling bad about the fantasy, so feeling further worthless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: You know, and so on and so forth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: So if you know that one of your triggers is feeling worthless then when you notice that you are feeling that, you have jumped into fantasy, well what could you do to feel worthy? What would make you feel that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Tell me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: (laughs) It has to be your answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: Give me a hint. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: There is not one right answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: No, no, I know what you mean. Like what would be an example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: When do you feel good about yourself? Best. When do you feel best about yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: When I\u2019m not (sigh) When I am not thinking about other things. When I am thinking about what I am doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Ah. So when you are present with something, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: So that is often your clue maybe of like, \u201cOops, I\u2019m not where I am. I am off in my head. I am somewhere.\u201d Or, \u201cI am very deeply in my feeling of being worthless and I am not actually working on the website. I am not actually doing research. I am not actually having a conversation with this person.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DB\">THERAPIST: \u201cNoticing the world around me as I am walking the dog.\u201d But if you know you feel better about yourself when you are present and engaged with whatever it is you have chosen to do in that moment, then that feeling is, you know, it is like a red flag waving at you, \u201cHello. Come back to \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: That red flag, though, always seems like work. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561853\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">CLIENT: And I think that is why fantasy is so easy. It is like, \u201cOh well, It is just \u201c You know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">CLIENT: Imagine this. So how do you <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">THERAPIST: So it is work. But you have worked hard before. You work hard lots of the time. It is okay to work hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">CLIENT: Yeah, says you. (laughs) As I fall asleep in your chair. Alright, well I will have to work hard in the next week and see you again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">THERAPIST: Sounds good. Same time next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED\">CLIENT: Same time every week until you tell me otherwise.
