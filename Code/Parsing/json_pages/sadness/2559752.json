I don't know if this is just coincidence or not. But I figure if I just reinforce that and if it really is true that she can tell, who knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: What happened? How did she tell you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: She just refused to... like, I was trying to get here, trying to get here, trying to get here, and she sat down, and she refused to move. She'd not lay down like she was tired. She sat, and she completely refused to move. And she's done that a couple of times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: And it's just preceded an asthma attack?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Within two or three minutes, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Wow, that's amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: That's pretty awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I don't know if it's just because my exasperation's causing me to breathe more, or... I'm trying to be really open-minded as to what is cause versus correlation. But thank you. You're a good girl, yeah. She probably just notices something in my body and... language or something I'm doing different. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">I don't think she's psychic or anything. [0:01:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, no, it makes sense that, particularly when you're in a state that's probably a bit agitated, she could be picking up on something more easily than you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, so... something where... because I'm not getting enough oxygen I'm not even processing the information enough to notice it. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Sorry about the attack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Oh, that's okay, I've been having them all the time right now, so... I... luckily, when I was at my parents' house, they gave me quite a bit of money to do some things with. And one of them was to be a very expensive filter that I could not normally justify in any way, shape, or form. I would <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200251\">have gone with one less expensive...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Right, not as good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: But Mom and Dad, they basically explained to me that... you know, we talked about it. And they said, because of the fact that most of the less expensive ones, cleaning a filter releases all... you know, you have to get it out, it's not self-contained. But it's meant to be reusable. [0:02:02] <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">It's... those ones, they look like they're better, but it's... you're just going to get it all over you getting it out. Therefore (exhaling), not helpful. And I thought, oh, I'll just get Mike to do it, or something like that. But they're right. I should just get one that is self-contained, that... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200292\">it's not a reusable filter, you buy the filter for every year. So... but... so that's actually been helping a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: But I think it's also ozone, which is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: I don't know. My doctor thinks it's because I'm obese. That's pretty much... I don't know even know why I bother taking his... he has a 4 PM emergency appointment every day for people that need to be seen. And I took it yesterday. And he said to me, your tonsils are swollen. You should probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">get them taken out. [0:02:57] And you should lose 15% of your body weight. And I'm really frustrated because I went through a lot. I mean, I had to cancel with you. I still had to [do it through the heat] (ph) at 4PM yesterday to get there, to just... I mean, I could have asked them to call in a new... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">I mean, not new, but extra inhalers because I'm going through them faster. I could have called and gotten that. I honestly was expecting something. I don't know what I was expecting. But (pause) I am pissed, really pissed that, no matter what happens with me... it's not just my GP. I mean, just about <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200313\">everybody but my rheumatologist, who... she's a little less so because she knows that it's all so interconnected. [0:03:55] She just simply tells me that it's more of a snowball effect. If I can lose the weight, then I'll be able to move more, which will help with this, and... she thinks it's a snowball <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200314\">effect. But she's nicer about it at least. But no matter what it is, it is, lose weight.

[0:11:03] Like, I'm extremely knowledgeable on many, but on a couple of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">things. And therefore I understand subject experts on things. Therefore I am willing to give them the respect due, because that's what they've studied for. I obviously don't' know better than they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:11:17)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: But then, when they fail me and they really don't have the knowledge that they want, they try to tell me about something that's not true or irrelevant (pause), it becomes harder and harder to put my faith in them. (Pause) (Exhaling) And that's pretty much... yeah. [0:11:57] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: [There's some things] (ph) that remind me of the way your in-laws have treated you, in that you're being treated as though...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: They know me better than I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I was going to put it a little bit differently, (inaudible at 0:12:21), but (pause) that... (Pause) I was just distracted thinking that I had your container [and wondering if she wanted to use it as a water dish] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Actually, she's not thirsty anymore, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Okay. [0:12:49] So (pause) my impression is that it at least feels like there's... and there probably often is an implication when a doctor is telling you that you need to lose weight, that you're being irresponsible (pause) and maybe even a little noncompliant?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: And unknowledgeable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">THERAPIST: And ignorant. And (pause) you're not being any of those things. I mean, you're actually kind of over the top. You're counting your calories to the fifth decimal place and restricting them considerably, and-I'm not sure but I'd imagine-trying to sort of do as much physical activity as your <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">system can physically bear, which may not be a lot. But that's not because you're not trying. It's because of your illnesses, your illness. [0:13:55] And yet you're being treated as though you're being noncompliant and, as you say, ignorant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: And possibly lying to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Obstinate. Non-responsive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">CLIENT: On top of it, I am trying to, in speaking to them, use precise terms, not terms I looked up on WebMD but actual precise terms for things. The only person who's going to be able to take charge of this is myself, and they use hyperbole, like using the word morbidly obese to me. And I said, actually, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF1\">I am not morbidly obese. I am one BMI category into the obese. That is it. I am... morbidly obese is over 35. I am 30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">CLIENT: That is not... do not use that phrase.

So clearly the implication... the idea is that you're not taking this seriously. [0:14:59] And they need to be threatening and dramatic, because you're failing to acknowledge and take responsibility for what's going on with you, which is really treating you as someone, as you say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D51\">who's very different...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">CLIENT: Than how I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) I guess you put it a little differently, as though they know you better than you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I do get... I get the idea that, because you're on the inside, you don't... sometimes there's a whole different part of you that you don't see. It's what others see, blah blah blah.

(Pause) And it's funny, because it's not even like... well, luckily I've been able to simplify it because of my health things I've been eating oatmeal for breakfast for the past five years. [0:17:00] So it's not like I have to really know that I'm eating more or less, it's the same packets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it doesn't sound like the money is a huge issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">CLIENT: I mean, the money is. I couldn't afford to eat extravagantly, let's be honest here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">THERAPIST: No, the money's an issue in its own right, but it doesn't sound like that's interacting much with the food stuff.

I've seen a lot of people who have pretty complicated relationships with food for emotional reasons. And that's okay. People who eat when they're anxious, or people who don't eat when they're anxious, or people for whom food takes on all sorts of meanings. I don't really <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201091\">think that's you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010B\">CLIENT: I brought back a dozen and a half macaroons from Cincinnati.

Not like OCD-obsessional, but another direction. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">CLIENT: No, just... you know. [0:19:58] But... pardon me for a second. I just need to make sure everything's okay there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">CLIENT: I hope everything's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:20:08)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">CLIENT: I don't know who it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">CLIENT: Oh, his bus broke down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">CLIENT: Well, he made friends, that's good.

But yeah, I mean, it's not really OCD... like, yeah, it is, I mean, the behavior's the same. But the driving force behind <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201371\">it isn't? I don't actually think, though... I mean, more than... I think... right now I'm having to tell this to myself. [0:20:57] I really don't feel like vacuuming more than every other day-we only have one room with carpet-on the room with carpet, is (ph) really going to do significant amounts of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201372\">changes. So I'm just trying to make sure that it's like, okay, which days am I going to do it, because I need to make sure I do it every other day. That kind of stuff.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">CLIENT: I do tend to sometimes be a little bit over-exaggerating. But my body was dismantled at one point in my life. My nervous system, right now my ability to breathe, I've had infections. I've had to have parts of my body taken out and replaced with metal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">CLIENT: My body's trying to kill me. It doesn't know it.

It's not mal-intended.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: And the worst part about that is the fact that it's really hard not to get wrapped up in that. [0:23:54] I mean, there is... I've had a couple people in my life tell me that I need to stop being so hard on myself and my body will stop, which is extremely well-intentioned but not true. Being <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201671\">self-critical is not making my immune system tear my body apart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: Geez, how many goddamn ways is everybody going to make this your fault?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, it's never mal-intentioned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">THERAPIST: I don't care. I mean, I guess I feel [bad and] (ph) protective of you.

But I don't need that, because they don't understand, very few people understand that I am the type of person who stresses out because I am too stressed out. I cannot force myself to relax.

You need people telling you that you're working incredibly hard, that you're doing everything you can and then some, that you are absolutely as on top of all of this as anybody could reasonably be, and that it is just really awful in so many ways that are not at all your fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: Yeah.

[0:25:57] I can usually shrug that <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201831\">kind of stuff off. But when people try and be like, oh, well, as soon as you come to accept yourself and stop being so hard on yourself, that your body's going to stop... maybe. Maybe my blood pressure might go down.

(Pause) And the worst part is that my... when things are really bad, like right now with my breathing and other things like that, or just in general whatever's happening... because I almost always have some sort of random extremely annoying thing du jour that I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF1\">try and ignore because it's just so bizarre that nobody would ever have it. The... (Pause) Whenever I tried to... I just... that's exactly the problem I'm having, is that I'm losing my attention and my focus.

I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">CLIENT: Basically understanding at what level you should take Vicodin or this or that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">CLIENT: Specifically because, if you don't do it at this point, when you take it when it gets worse, you're not going to be able to take enough to get rid of the pain. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">THERAPIST: I see. Huh. Like, you've got to take it when it's a six, because if you wait until it's an eight...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:31:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">THERAPIST: Then it's too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EB\">CLIENT: It's too late.

I mean, it's sort of effective. It's better than nothing else. But I don't really like the way I feel when I'm on those things either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, if part of the reason you want to be getting rid of the pain is so you can pay attention to things, be focused... I mean, not the only thing, but I guess that's part of it, and remember stuff...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\">THERAPIST: I would think Vicodin is really not ideal. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">CLIENT: Or even just be awake (chuckling). Yeah, so I only really use that... and we talked about it for a long time, and we did figure out... because you have to figure out what works for you. [0:32:55] This is why I so miss him. I hope he doesn't go to jail for life at this point. It's breaking my <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F71\">heart. Realizing that we had needed to use that awareness for sleep, it was maybe not for during the day, but, hey, if you wait, if you're in pain and you're sleeping, if it gets to the seven or, whatever, six, whatever, take something now because once you get to an eight there's no way in the world <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201F72\">you're going to take enough to be able to get back to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">CLIENT: And (pause) so for me that's really how I have adjusted to that.

I probably could call my rheumatologist and told her this (ph), that I had something. But the point is that it's not already <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202071\">recommended less, so I usually wait until it gets extremely bad anyways.

Those are the... basically the drawbacks of it aren't especially great. Opiates don't do great things to your body. [0:34:54] And I'm not talking about not getting enough medicine not great things to your body. I'm talking immediate, more obvious things.
