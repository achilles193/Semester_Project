(pause) Dave promised he would do the laundry yesterday when we got back from our parish retreat. After dinner \u2014 we went out with friends for dinner. When we came back, I was really tired because I had done all the driving for the retreat, and Dave swore he would get the laundry <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">done. I put all of my pants, like every pair of pants I own, in the laundry. And I went to sleep at like 9:00.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I got up this morning, took a shower, had breakfast, got dressed \u2014 well, got mostly dressed. I couldn't find the laundry basket, so I was like \"Where's the laundry?\" He was like \"Oh, that's still on the dryer. You're not leaving for work for another hour, right?\" I was like \"I see Brian this morning. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">It's on the Google calendar which you check.\" He was like \"You didn't tell me.\" I put it in the Google calendar. (sighing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And our laundry isn't actually in our unit. It's in the building, but there's no direct access from our unit to the basement where the laundry is. I have to actually leave my apartment and go around the building to the other entrance to get to the basement. So I had to like find pajama pants, and go <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">(chuckles) to the laundry, and bring it back, and it was a thing, and that's why I'm late. I'm sorry.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (sighing) Sorry. (long pause) Anyway. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So what comes to mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (sighing) I don't know. (pause) I'm still really tired even though I went to bed early. (pause) So my parish's retreat was this weekend. We left Friday right after work. (pause) (blowing nose) Excuse me. Got up to the campsite. I was feeling really antisocial, so I just went to our room and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">went to sleep. Dave went to the evening prayer service and hung out with people until late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And then Saturday there was programming in the morning. I don't know. I found part of the programming really boring, but then the person running the program told us, you know, \"Go and make art and then come back and talk about your art.\" And that was not boring, but I found it really challenging and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">stressful because, you know, being asked to just go make art on command is, you know, difficult. (blowing nose) And I'm apparently allergic to the summertime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I'm sorry to hear that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, then in the afternoon there were activities. I signed up for what I thought was going to be helping children make crafts, but it turned out to be adults making crafts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Making props really for Sunday school. So the way that the Sunday school program works for the younger kids is there are all of these props to deal with the various Bible stories that the kids have. So when the adult is reading the story, they put the props on the floor in order and create a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">kind of diorama as they're reading the story. It's nice for the kids. So we made some props for that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">I'm glad I decided to skip the boating because the water looked really cold. I just sat on the dock watching the water, and it was much more pleasant than getting splashed with cold icky lake water. (pause) Yeah. Then there was dinner and the talent show. That was actually kind of fun. And a bonfire.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2320797\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">And then some of the teenagers decided to start telling scary stories, and that was the point where I decided nope, I'm going to go back to my cabin now. No scary stories for me. Anyway, it was nice. It was like summer camp but for grownups and shorter. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">It was really nice and I really enjoyed it. It reminded me why I love my parish so much and why I stick around in spite of all of the variety of nastiness that has happened politically within the parish. And I really do feel like this is my family in a very real and important sense, but at the same <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">time there is \u2014 I clearly didn't fit in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">Like, for example, we were making props for the Sunday school and we have these little wooden figurines about this tall, and we were painting them to look like, you know, people. And one woman in the group kept painting them all this peachy-pink color. I was like \"These people are Middle Easterners. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">They're like Jews from 2,000 years ago. They wouldn't have been peachy-pink in color.\" And she just got really offended at that. So, you know, I mixed up a bunch of different flesh tones and started painting, you know, a bunch of them brown and black and various shades of not-white. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">And then we moved onto making characters to represent our contemporaries in the church as opposed to Biblical figures. These two women kept grouping them, you know, mom, dad, boy-child, girl-child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">I was like \"Well, some families have two moms and some families have two dads.\" (chuckles) So there were two shapes of little wooden figurines, and they kept insisting that one shape was female because it looked vaguely like a person wearing a skirt and the other shape was male, even though it was mostly <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">just a cylinder with a head attached. I was like \"But women can wear pants and men can wear dresses, especially if we're talking about people from the Middle East 2,000 years ago when everyone wore robes.\" Like it was very frustrating. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">Yeah. (long pause) (sneezing)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Bless you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Excuse me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">My sister has posted these really long, gushing, overly-sentimental, trite things on Facebook for Father's Day yesterday. I couldn't bring myself to be gushing or sentimental. I did call my dad, told him happy Father's Day, and asked him what was new. His response was \"Same shit, different day. Life <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">isn't worth living. I don't know why I continue living. Everything is the same. There is nothing good.\" (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">So then he asked me what was new with my life and of course, there's nothing I can talk to my dad about in my life. Like I certainly \u2014 [not that I was poly] for obvious reasons. My parents would just flip. So I can't talk about relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">I can't talk about church. That upsets dad. So I couldn't talk about the parish retreat. I told my parents I was taking voice lessons and piano lessons and their response \u2014 like I told them that a couple of months ago, and their response was \"Why? That's such a waste of time.\" It's like there is absolutely <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">nothing important in my life that I can tell my parents about. I've got nothing. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">But of course, that set my dad off on another round of depressive ranting about how life isn't worth living. \"You just get up, go to work, come home, might as well be dead.\" It was just really \u2014 it's pitiful. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2320797\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">I don't know. I just \u2014 thinking about my family is deeply distressing to me, that's all. (pause) And I have friends who have teenage or even adult children who have sane, healthy relationships with their kids, and their kids tell them things about their lives and they have like real relationships. (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">I don't know why I can't have that with my parents. Well, I do, because my parents are terrible and trying to be honest with them would only end badly, you know, in a more [meta] sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: In a like (inaudible) sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And a woman at my church, she's in charge of the Sunday school program. Her kids are all grown and married and she does not understand any of her daughters at all, and is an artist. She went to art school, works as a graphic designer, has her own printing business. Her partner <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">is an architect (chuckles) and her kids are all [pragmatists] (chuckles). One daughter is a civil engineer, another is a doctor, and she just does not get her kids at all or their interests or their hobbies. They're little space aliens to her, but they still have conversations about the things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D2\">are important to them and they tell their mom pretty much everything. Even if she doesn't understand, she's, you know, loving and supportive and that's wonderful. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">I don't know. Why can't my parents be like that? It's not fair. (pause) That's kind of a useless thing to think because, you know, the world is what it is and I can't change it. So wishing it otherwise is a waste of time and energy. (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Well, I think it makes you worried actually to talk about how upset and unjust it feels to have parents like yours. I'm not sure about this, but I wonder if you \u2014 I have no doubt you sort of thought and felt the last thing you said about it being useless, [but it also felt a little like bait <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">to me to come in and disagree with or something which] \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Not intentionally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. I know it wasn't intentionally that. But it could have got us into like a kind of back and forth about the validity of your feelings or something \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: \u2014 which I think is less anxious than actually \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: \u2014 putting them out there in the way you had been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: (long pause) Like I think in a very real sense, my parents don't understand that their children aren't their belongings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mmmm-hmmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: (long pause) I think they just fundamentally don't get that we're each our own person with our own, you know, rich inner life and hopes and dreams and desires, challenges and struggles.

It sounds ridiculous when I say it. Like how can you not understand that, you know, other people are other people? It seems ridiculously obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Well, it's one thing to know in your head and another to act that way.
