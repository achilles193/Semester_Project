(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Good morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Good morning. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Marty Templeton is kind of out there. Sometime I would like to play you something else from the  (inaudible) that I also love but that\u2019s more in that tradition.  I wonder if it\u2019s like showing somebody this and saying this is psychoanalysis. You might want to show them another thing, too, even <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">though you [love them both] (ph?), for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re doing the Marty Templeton version?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s not that far off. (pause) Then again, a person\u2019s analysis, a musical person\u2019s, is different from any other, so it\u2019s hard to make big groupings like that. (long pause)  I wonder what you were like in high school. (pause) Somehow there are reverberations from hearing your story.  First, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">you kind of want to say, \u201cI\u2019ll take you. I want you,\u201d but also there is a reflective when I think about what Jay was like; (long pause)  and what the world was like in 1970. (pause) 1990.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: [It was the late \u201880s.] (ph?) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: The college admission has changed, I imagine.] (ph?)  I didn\u2019t get into the school I wanted to get into. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m commiserating with you, but it did make me think of that. (pause)  I wanted to go to UCLA and I applied early enough. I really didn\u2019t get into any schools except <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">Vassar and I didn\u2019t want to apply to any Ivy League schools, except for UCLA, that I just sort of applied on a whim and Vanderbilt, Elon, and suddenly the whole landscape changed of what I thought I wanted.  (pause) I guess I have a pretty persistent [imposter] (ph?) syndrome that comes up around that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">because my mom works at Vassar. She\u2019s not a faculty member, but she\u2019s been there for 26 years and she\u2019s a computer scientist. She sort of manages a lot of projects managing to do with making things digital for students, like core selection and the online application and senior grades and course reviews <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B3\">\u2013 anything that students do on the computer \u2013 so she\u2019s well known among the administrators.  She works with most of them now. In reference to high school, there are a lot of students that when you hear that they\u2019re going to Vassar, you think \u201cWell . . . Their so-and-so works there.\u201d You wonder if they <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B4\">would get in if that person didn\u2019t work there, so I felt that way about myself for some time.  You can\u2019t really know and it doesn\u2019t really matter, except that it feels bad. (long pause)  [Took] (ph?) that energy for next year. (long pause)  Where you shared with me, it sort of flowed effortless in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B5\">wind away and not sort of have it stick around. I don\u2019t know. I think it feels like that\u2019s the way that I would like to honor it and to show my appreciation for you sharing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562298\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s how you want it to happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah, but if I were cool, chill Allison. (scoffs) I mean, it sort of has. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dwelling on it, like on what it means for me or for you or for us, like the way that I do sometimes with other stuff you say, but it has brought up a lot, like the things that I mentioned.  It\u2019s still <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">echoing. Maybe, in part, because of what you expressed about wanting to be cautious and now I\u2019m not sure what I have to say about that. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: I imagine the part that us a little clingy and that you don\u2019t want to be is relating to where I sat and, in a way, sort of relating to me in a more personal \u2013 not quite the word I want \u2013 way. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Yes. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: I guess I could say me in terms of my history, what I\u2019ve been through, stuff like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, and how you feel about something, how you feel about what you went through and how you feel about sharing it. I guess it\u2019s more something that you hesitated about it for the particular reason that you did.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s sticking around in that sense. (pause) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">that. I think it\u2019s like this little gift that I\u2019m cherishing. It\u2019s hard to let it go. (long pause) But not because there is hope for some other kind of relationship; it just feels good. It feels good to have been shared with. It feels like part of this relationship, another one. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I think there is also some of the split happening with it, in that your focus seems to be entirely on the aspect of it as a gift or something that I shared. I can see how those are there, but the content seems gone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Somehow that\u2019s more  (inaudible) let go of. (both laugh) I think that\u2019s a pretty central interpretation to most things here. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking I didn\u2019t know if you were referring to what I just said or the kind of interpretation from me yesterday that we were talking about; and then it occurred to me that they\u2019re both kind of actually the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Complex to think about. The interpretation. In telling the story, the interpretation, maybe it feels to me like here sometimes with you and you are inviting and closed and maybe almost misleading. And then, at the end of the week, I go away and I don\u2019t . (inaudible) So smiling with each other <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">and then you are not sharing about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: [I guess (chuckles) what I had in mind was that I was, at that time, you and what\u2019s going on here can, without quite realizing it, be living in the fantasy of being in.] (ph?)  And surely there are things that contribute to it. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m not a part of that in some way, but that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">wasn\u2019t where I intended the emphasis to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Just now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: And yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: What you were doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: You just said because of how you are and how you\u2019re doing, I can feel this way. And I\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t have a part in it, but to me the main point seemed to be, like with the weekend, I was talking about it, the point in my mind was like I was kind of in the same area.  Of course, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">I\u2019m in course steps that I\u2019m doing and at the end of the year I\u2019m part of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562298\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s kind of ambiguous, like you felt like you fit in when it wasn\u2019t entirely because of your being in the fantasy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: In some ways you did fit in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: Absolutely, but I had a fantasy about what that meant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Yes. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: You could say that circumstances pulled for me to have that fantasy, and maybe that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know. But whatever the people around \u2013 the way it was set up or something \u2013 were doing, there was something I also really wanted to believe, that I was enjoying believing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure what it is I want to believe here anymore. (pause) I\u2019m not sure what the equivalent would be. Maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be anything specific. Maybe it\u2019s just sort of general closer-ness than farther-ness or that I\u2019m somehow different from everybody else in the way that you feel about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">me.  (pause) Maybe it\u2019s just as simple as you\u2019re good at telling me what\u2019s going on for you. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: I would imagine there are a few different things. At one level, I imagine it\u2019s about I feel differently about you and everybody else. Then at another level, I think it\u2019s that there is a kind of symmetry about what we\u2019re sharing and how we\u2019re relating to each other. And at another level, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">think there\u2019s probably  (inaudible) going on. We\u2019re the same. We\u2019re together with no gaps.  (long pause)  I guess what we\u2019ve seen is that, including just now, focusing on those things is, in part, to ward off feeling bad \u2013 and not simply feeling bad that those things aren\u2019t quite the way you want them <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">to be. Yeah?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it\u2019s something else, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s not just like I want to focus on those because they\u2019re just nicer to think about, it\u2019s also because I don\u2019t want to go to some of these other things that I\u2019m sure really feels crummy. We have just a few minutes.  (long pause)  We should stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
