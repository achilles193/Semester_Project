And then, out July, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And I plan to... Yeah, I plan to probably come back either, probably the first week in August. (client affirms) Last week in July, but probably the first week in August, but I\u2019ll definitely be in touch, say, mid-July (client affirms), just to give you a sense of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: What\u2019s going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: ...yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah, oh good! I don\u2019t even remember the last time I was here! Was it like, two weeks ago? (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: No, it was more than that, because I think we were supposed to meet last week originally, and you had rescheduled because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Oh, right, because I was out of town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Like, probably three weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah. So, yeah. I guess I have a really good lawyer. Did I have a lawyer when I came here last time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You had just gotten a lawyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Okay, so... So that\u2019s good. My trip home went really well. I was very anxious about it. Well, there were a few things. Right before I left, I had asked Rich if he could start giving me some money every month like, some form of child support. We couldn\u2019t agree on an amount. Literally, the amount <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">varies by like a $100, so... which now my lawyer is like, \u201cI don\u2019t even think that\u2019s the right amount.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cHe should be giving you more.\u201d So, when I landed... So I was already anxious about going home, because, well, A) I was travelling with Brady for the first time by myself. That\u2019s kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">of like, you know... I do, I fly with him a lot, but usually Rich was always with me or someone was with me. So this was just like, you know, it\u2019s a lot of logistics, getting him down there, but he was wonderful. You know, obviously, to see my parents and, you know, all this family and stuff, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">So when I landed, I had sent Rich an e-mail like, a day or two before just like, \u201cYou know, maybe you could start giving me this much a month, because I\u2019m really running out of money. If you could think about covering this portion of his school...\u201d So it was like a couple of things we were trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">like, agree to. So when I landed, his e-mail, I had got an e-mail as soon as I landed from him. It was basically like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to give you the amount you want. No, I\u2019m not going to cover extra school, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to give you, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable giving you money until <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200312\">the papers have been signed.\u201d So, I got really upset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">Not like, I was trying to stay calm, because I was with Brady on a flight, you know? But I just was like, just the stress, and particularly of the finances, and just him being a jerk about it. I feel like, he knows he owes me child support, but he\u2019s not wanting to give it, or give me anything. I mean, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">he\u2019s still paying for his daycare portion, which is, like $800, my daycare portion, which is $800 a month. So I guess that\u2019s something, but I was asking him for like, $300 more a month. So, I got really frustrated. So when I got in... And I was very overwhelmed, because I was going to see... My brother <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200332\">was picking me up and I hadn\u2019t seen him since December, so when he picked me up, you know, it was just like... He was just like, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d I was just like, \u201cWahh!\u201d You know, I kind of just like... told him what was going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">My brother is, he\u2019s the oldest. He\u2019s really, he\u2019s like the most, he\u2019s very generous and the most like, sensible. So he was kind of like, \u201cListen!\u201d He, his wife that he married, was married previously and divorced and has two children, so he understands like, he\u2019s, they\u2019re, you know, they deal with her <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">ex-husband and stuff. So he was kind of like, you know, \u201cListen! I know you want to be nice about everything, and you feel bad about stuff, but you need to cut the shit and you need to like, get really firm. You need to like, deal with your lawyer, you need to ask, you know, make sure you\u2019re getting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">everything you and Brady need.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI understand you want to be friends with him and that\u2019s important to do, too, but at the same time, you can\u2019t let him just like walk all over you and not give you things when you know you need it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">He\u2019s like, \u201cSo his not giving you money is really not giving it to Brady, and you know, he\u2019s got to understand that.\u201d You know, my brother was just like, you know, \u201cMake sure that the document you have covers everything like...\u201d You know, and he was just saying how the issues they\u2019ve come up with, with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">the document, the agreement that his wife currently has with her ex, how certain things don\u2019t get paid and whatever. So he\u2019s like, \u201cYou want to just make sure that you\u2019re getting everything that you need, and don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re tr , that you feel like you\u2019re being some like, money-hungry person, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200372\">but you\u2019re just taking care of yourself and Brady.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">He\u2019s like, you know, \u201cRich has a lot more opportunity, financial opportunity. You know, he has a big financial trust that\u2019s worth many millions of dollars that eventually goes to him. He\u2019s like the sole inheritor and he\u2019s like, you know, that he\u2019ll be able to pay for things. You don\u2019t have that, so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">for you to ask him for a couple of hundred dollars more a month is not really that crazy, you know?\u201d So, he was really good. He was just very much like, \u201cYou\u2019ll get through it. It\u2019s a tough time, but stop being like, really nice and letting him, you know, get away with things or you know, not give you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200392\">things that you\u2019re supposed to have.\u201d So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">So that was good and then we got to my parents\u2019 house. Well, my brother was like, \u201cDo you want to go Mom and Dad\u2019s?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, I guess I should. I should just go see them.\u201d So we went and then I saw my Dad. My Dad was wonderful. He gave me a big hug, asked me how I was doing, and he basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">was just like, he looked at me and was like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of you and Brady here.\u201d He\u2019s like, you know, \u201cI\u2019m not going to have you pay for anything, we\u2019ll take care of you. I want you to relax and like, enjoy your time here.\u201d So that was really nice, for him to say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Then, when I saw my Mom, she, we hugged each other. We didn\u2019t say anything. We hugged each other, and then we like, cried while we hugged for a few minutes. Then all she kept saying was, \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d Then I said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to be home.\u201d Then, other than that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">she never talked about my divorce the entire trip. It was like, never brought up. So, she came to IKEA with us and like, picked out a new dining table for, you know, she picked up stuff and was like, \u201cThis would be nice.\u201d But she never... addressed any of it, I think, because my Dad had told her like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">\u201cDon\u2019t upset her while you\u2019re here.\u201d So I guess she took that as, just don\u2019t like, bring it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">I mean, my Dad would bring it up and just was like, \u201cSo, is Rich giving you money? What\u2019s going on with that?\u201d So I explained some things and you know, I didn\u2019t ask them for money. I guess I could. You know, they don\u2019t have a lot of money, but my Dad was like, \u201cIf you need something, let us know.\u201d So... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">I might have to, at some point, but... But they were really... good. I mean, it was very much... Then my other brother came from Nicaragua, so he was there and just asked how I was doing. But everyone in general was just, it was a good distraction. Everyone was, it was just nice to be with them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">It was the first time I had been with my family without Rich since I was like, 19. I got to enjoy my family, kind of in a different way, like without a partner. It was actually kind of nice like, I said to my friend, normally when I\u2019m home for a week, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, God! I\u2019m ready to go back home!\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">This was the first time I didn\u2019t want to leave. I mean, I\u2019m sure it had to do with the fact that I\u2019m just like, going through this, too. But I like, wanted to be around them. I wanted to stay with them. I just felt like, it was a different way to be with them, that I really enjoyed, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">So, it was great! I mean, they, we had dinners together, we just, we did everything together while we were there. And Brady loved it! I mean, he had such a wonderful time with them! We had a big 40th birthday party for my brother, and at that party is where I saw my, you know, extended family like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">some second cousins and stuff that live there. They were just like, \u201cHow\u2019s it going? Where\u2019s Rich?\u201d And some of them knew and some of them didn\u2019t, so I had to kind of break it to some people. They were... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">You know, particularly like my godmother and some other people... My godmother actually just got divorced anyway, so she was like... \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just sorry we, you\u2019ve been going through this without us knowing,\u201d you know? And she\u2019s, they weren\u2019t, she was like, \u201cNo one judges you. Like, you have to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">do what makes you happy and...\u201d You know, she said some peo , you know, \u201cThis happens a lot. You know, we just want you to know that...\u201d She was like, \u201cYou can text me if you\u2019re sad, if you\u2019re lonely. You can call me, I can come up.\u201d They were all just very much like... Like, I guess I got the impression, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200452\">I felt like people would be like, \u201cOh, my God! Like, why?\u201d Like, as if I had made a mistake. But everyone was just like, \u201cYeah, you know, it happens, but how are you, you look great. Like, let us know what you need. You know, it will, it\u2019s hard, but you\u2019ll be okay and...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">So that was really great. It was like, so nice for people to say that, you know? Some of my family is divorced and remarried, and you see like, how happy they are. Like, my godfather was just saying how he, you know, he travels with his wife who, you know, they\u2019re both divorced. He\u2019s just like, \u201cYou <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">know, you just, sometimes you\u2019re not meant to be with someone, and then you find someone you are. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Like, you know, they know this is a really hard time. You know, \u201cYou\u2019ll be happ , you\u2019ll be fully like, happy and, you know, well and at some point, you know. Maybe you don\u2019t feel it now, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">but you will, so...\u201d Everyone was just so supportive and awesome. So that was really great. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">You know, that\u2019s like, kind of what I, but I was expecting this trip to be much, like totally different. I thought it was going to be stressful and like, sad and difficult, and it wasn\u2019t. It was actually really enjoyable. Then the last night I was there, my sister-in-law finally was like, \u201cI haven\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200491\">had a chance to (because she\u2019s been divorced)...\u201d She was like, \u201cI want to talk to you about stuff.\u201d She just was great! She gave me, you know, she, you know, kind of, she left her husband, her ex-husband. So she was like, you know, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge decision,\u201d because she had two kids. They were, at the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200492\">time, they were, I guess 4 and 6. They\u2019re now like, 16 and 14, but she was like, you know, \u201cYou feel like you shouldn\u2019t do it, because you have a child and you don\u2019t want to ruin a family. But you know, in the end, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re damaging him. You\u2019re not hurting him. You know, of course, he\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200493\">ask about...\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">She was like, \u201cI still deal with it.\u201d You know, she still deals with it, with her kids, with issues with the dad or whatever. But she said, \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s better.\u201d One thing she said that made me feel, she said, \u201cYou will still feel that, sometimes like, did you do the right thing? Like, you\u2019ll have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">that question come up.\u201d She was like, \u201cYou should know that\u2019s normal.\u201d My godmother said the same thing. She says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel sometimes like, I, maybe I, you know, did I do the right thing? Was this a mistake?\u201d They were both, just said the same thing. They were like, \u201cIt happens, and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B2\">eventually goes away.\u201d But they were like, \u201cIt\u2019s a common feeling. So, you know, don\u2019t freak out if that happens.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">You know, because they were like, \u201cDo you want to get back with Rich?\u201d I was like, \u201cNo!\u201d That\u2019s, it\u2019s more, any time I have those moments, it\u2019s more like, because of either my situation now like, not having enough money, or Brady\u2019s not having two parents. That\u2019s really the times when I\u2019m like, \u201cOh! <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">What have I done?\u201d You know? It\u2019s never like, \u201cOh, my God! I... He was the love of my life!\u201d You know, it\u2019s never been that. So they were like, \u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d (chuckles) You know, so... It made me feel a lot better when they said that, because, you know, my sister-in-law, Wendy was like, \u201cIt\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">a common feeling. And it sucks!\u201d She was like, \u201cBecause you do, you try to get strong enough to do it, and then you do it, and then you start to question yourself. That\u2019s really probably one of the worst feelings, you know.\u201d But she was like, you know, \u201cI met your brother and I\u2019m really happy and...\u201d So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">So, it was a really good trip. It was wonderful. I felt really uplifted by it, so... Brady had a wonderful time. So, I think what happened was, we got back and then (we got back last Wednesday), and then... Brady went back to Rich\u2019s house, kind of right away. Then I had no plans last weekend. It was <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">the first weekend, where I didn\u2019t have plans with like, anyone or to do anything. It really freaked me out. I got really... like, sad and like, kind of lonely, I got very lonely.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">My friends like, particularly my friend Paula (who lives in California), was like, (chuckles) she was funny, she\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019ve never felt like, loneliness! Think about it! You never like, developed that, like, within yourself. You lived with your parents, then you went to college and lived with roommates, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">and then you met Rich at 19. So you\u2019ve always had someone... Even if Rich was travelling...\u201d You know, she was like, \u201cYou still, you know, if he went away for a couple of days, you\u2019d hang out with friends. You need constant stimulation. That\u2019s your personality. You\u2019ve always been with someone. You\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">never been lonely. All of us have had a lonely point, where...\u201d So was describing when she first moved to DC and you know, didn\u2019t really have any friends. She was like, \u201cI was really lonely, you know?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">You know, my friend Kayla was saying, when she had to move, like, when she went somewhere... She, like everyone I know has had a lonely point, and I haven\u2019t! Like, I really tried to think... I was trying to think like, when I felt... I think the last time I felt lonely was like, the first two days when <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200531\">I started college, when I was 18. I was very sad, because I didn\u2019t know anyone and I didn\u2019t have my family, but then I met like, a friend like, three days later. But that was probably the last time I\u2019ve ever felt lonely. So, I think it\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s weird, about me, but... because <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200532\">I think most, I\u2019m assuming most people have gone through some sort of, know what loneliness feels like. And I just don\u2019t. Until I like, acc , I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s accept it or like, deal with it somehow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">I think that\u2019s like, my biggest issue is like, how to handle that. So... So Friday, I was like, really bummed. You know, we had this work retreat at a winery on Friday. So my friend was like, \u201cLet\u2019s just, we\u2019ll go to the winery, we\u2019ll have fun.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, if you don\u2019t have plans this weekend, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">you know? Like, make plans for yourself! Like, you don\u2019t need to like, always be with people.\u201d So, it ended up after the winery, I, you know, hung out with a couple of co-workers. Then my co-worker was like, \u201cOh, do you want to go see a movie?\u201d So I ended up doing something Friday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">But I woke up Saturday and I was like, \u201cOh, my God! I have nothing to do,\u201d with the exception of a birthday party being thrown by one of the girls that doesn\u2019t really talk to me anymore, attended by my other friend, who doesn\u2019t talk to me anymore. So... I had been a little anxious about going to that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200571\">but I decided to go, because... I wanted to show them that like, Rich and I actually still talk to each other. Like, even though they don\u2019t want to talk to me, that even my ex (who I did this to) like, will still talk to me, and that, I don\u2019t want to like, hide away, you know what I mean? Like, I just <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200572\">didn\u2019t want to like, just because they don\u2019t talk to me, I didn\u2019t want it to feel like... like, I don\u2019t know. I just wanted it to be like, \u201cI\u2019m doing okay, and I\u2019m going to be nice to you,\u201d so... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">So, I went. I, you know, Rich and Brady were there. It was nice, because I got to see Brady like, on the Saturday, where I don\u2019t normally see him. When I got there, the girl who was hosting, who doesn\u2019t really talk to me that much (I don\u2019t know why she invited me, but she was probably being nice)... <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">I brought a present, you know, I was like, \u201cThank you for inviting me. It\u2019s nice to be here.\u201d She was like, \u201cOh, thanks for coming.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">Then my, the girl, Emma (sp), who was my very close friend (who doesn\u2019t talk to me), she and her husband are very much on \u201cTeam Rich\u201d (Rich hangs out with them all the time), I saw her and gave... You know, I said, \u201cHi.\u201d They just had a baby, so I was like, \u201cCongratulations. She\u2019s adorable, here is <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B1\">a present for her. You look great, you know, hope everything is well.\u201d She was like, \u201cThank you.\u201d You know, so then I went and played with Brady. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">Then my friend, Carla (who\u2019s awesome), came over and hung out with me, because the other girls were... It was a small party, but the girls were just kind of hanging out, and the guys were hanging out. The guys, the husbands, don\u2019t really, I... They just say \u201chi\u201d to me and that\u2019s about it. They don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">really like, talk to me. So, the guys were all hanging out and the girls. Then my friend... So I was just playing with the kids. My friend Carla came over and was like, \u201cHow are you? How are you doing? Like...\u201d I told her and then I was like, \u201cHow are you?\u201d We just like, talked and hung out and she <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D2\">was very nice about it and hung out with me. Then we went up to get pizza, she sat next to me and ate with me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F\">So did Rich. I mean, Rich would talk to me and... It felt a little weird at times, because I felt like they knew everything I had done. It was, you know what I mean? Like, I was sitting there playing with the kids, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWow! They know like, that I slept with someone else when I was married.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005F1\">But you know it\u2019s like, they know this stuff about you, so you feel really like... I don\u2019t know, I just felt like... I mean, I\u2019m sure they weren\u2019t thinking of it, but it\u2019s just weird not to think about that. It\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20061\">THERAPIST: Kind of exposed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, totally! Like, every one of them has their thing that no one knows about, but like everyone knows everything about me, so... It felt a little weird, but I mean, I just kind of smiled and enjoyed my time with Brady. I was joking and talking to Rich about stuff, like we were fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20065\">So, when I left, it got, I got really sad, because I had to leave Brady again, and then I didn\u2019t have anything planned for the rest of the day, or weekend. So... I got really down and then I called my friend. She was like, \u201cListen!\u201d She was like, and that\u2019s when she was telling me I need to learn how <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200651\">to be lonely sometimes. She was like, \u201cYou have to make plans for yourself. Just because you\u2019re not with someone doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have things to do.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20067\">So she was like, \u201cWhat do you feel like doing?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I should go for a run.\u201d She was like, \u201cGo for a run! It\u2019s really pretty, you know, you could take the dog with you. You know, get your favorite take-out or make your favorite meal and watch a movie tonight. Like, it\u2019s okay to do those things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200671\">you know.\u201d I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d So I did that! I went, I went home, got the dog, and I went for a really long run, and I felt a lot better afterwards. You know, I went and got take-out, went home, I was actually so exhausted from my run that I didn\u2019t like the idea of like, going out to do something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200672\">It seemed like, terrible! So (chuckles), I just like, watched some movies and went to bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20066-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20066-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">Then, on Sunday, I, you know, my dad... I had been telling my Dad that I wanted to get a new bike, so I could start biking in to work on weeks I don\u2019t have Brady (because my old bike is pretty heavy and it\u2019s tough for a longer commute). So, my dad called, you know, he was like, \u201cIf you see a bike, I\u2019ll <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200691\">buy it for you. Just, you know, go find one that\u2019s pretty inexpensive.\u201d So on Sunday, I was like, \u201cI\u2019ll go look for a bike!\u201d So the weather was nice, so I found a nice bike, I\u2019m really excited to ride it next week, because I had Brady this week. But, so I was really excited about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">Then, I went to the museum in the afternoon, because there was an exhibit I had been wanting to see and it was the last day. So, I was like, go down, the parking is free on Sunday, I\u2019ll go and, so I did that. Then I picked up Brady at 5:00. So I ended up... You know, my friend called me at the end of <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B1\">the day. She was like, \u201cSo, how was it? Your weekend?\u201d I was like, \u201cIt was really good! You know, I actually, I did stuff that I wanted to do and it wasn\u2019t so bad! It was really nice!\u201d She was like, \u201cThat\u2019s great! It\u2019s baby steps, you know?\u201d So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">I think I\u2019ll still have moments, where... I mean, I look at my calendar now and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything that weekend.\u201d I get like, almost anxious about it, but I need to like, not get anxious about it. I need to just be like, \u201cOh!\u201d See it more as like, an opportunity to do things rather than <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">like, you know, like a bad thing. Like, even she said, she has twins, and she was like, \u201cOh, my God! I love my babies, but what would I give to have a full day of like, just to myself, to do whatever I wanted, you know? With no one to bother me!\u201d (chuckles) I was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good point.\u201d So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">So I think that\u2019s, that\u2019s like a hurdle I have to keep dealing with. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know like... I hope I\u2019m doing like, the right steps to kind of, get over it. I hope it goes away. Like, do, I mean, I guess people are always lonely at some point, you know? But, it\u2019s a crappy feeling. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">like feeling lonely very, you know, who does, I guess? But... I don\u2019t love it at all! (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20071\">THERAPIST: Well, you\u2019re always seeking out other people\u2019s company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20073\">CLIENT: Right. Right! And it\u2019s like, and if I\u2019m alone, it\u2019s like I notice families together or couples. Like, I notice people with other people, and it\u2019s kind of, I was like, oh, you know like, \u201cI wish I had that.\u201d I kind of, I mean, I do. I have some friends, but... (pause) It\u2019s just been like, a weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200731\">time. Then my friend, Olivia (who\u2019s been great), I haven\u2019t seen her in like, two months. Her husband doesn\u2019t talk to me because of this, all this stuff. But she has kind of been. She\u2019s the one that I was like, unsure about, and then she\u2019s been great. But, I tried to like, make plans with her and just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200732\">be like, \u201cOh, are you available for lunch or, you know...\u201d She just kind of evades my invitations, so... I kind of, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve tried often enough that now, I\u2019m just going to stop trying and I\u2019ll see what she does, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">She\u2019s not like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be your friend.\u201d She just hasn\u2019t really... tried to like, make plans with me or accept any invites that I make to her, so... (pause) So that\u2019s kind of a bummer. You know, that\u2019s like, \u201cOh, someone else that\u2019s not around,\u201d you know. So, I feel like, very limited in my <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200751\">friends right now. I feel like... I have so many that don\u2019t live here. I have a ton that don\u2019t live here, because they\u2019ve all moved away, but... The ones here, it\u2019s like, not too many, so... I need to see if I can make more friends. (chuckles) It\u2019s just a bummer, because it\u2019s because of like, what I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200752\">did, that\u2019s why, you know. (pause) I mean, it\u2019s only people who don\u2019t need to know all that, will be okay with being my friends, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">(pause) I think I\u2019m going to start doing like, I\u2019ll be biking, I like biking, so I\u2019m going to start doing that. I\u2019m going to take a dance class at the dance complex. I used to do that, a few years ago. So... I\u2019m just kind of like, trying to... get into my hobbies, I guess. I think that\u2019s a good way <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200771\">to... to deal with some of this. Then I\u2019m trying to meet with my lawyer, hopefully tomorrow, because she reviewed my documents and she wants to talk about stuff, so... Rich, when I responded to his e-mail with, \u201cWell, I guess... (once he told he didn\u2019t want to give me money and didn\u2019t agree to anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200772\">I had asked).\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s disappointing that we\u2019re not on the same page, so I guess we should stop mediation right now, because there are no point in paying for her, if we can\u2019t agree to things, because I don\u2019t want to sit there and disagree on things and pay, you know, $300 an hour.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">So I said, \u201cMy lawyer is going to get some stuff, and then we could present it to your lawyer.\u201d So he called me and was like, \u201cYou know, do we really need to have the lawyers talking? I mean, maybe there is a way like, you can present it to me.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t want to really present <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200791\">it to you over the phone or in person. I\u2019ll e-mail you everything, because I feel like we don\u2019t really...\u201d I said, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t, I get a little bullied sometimes when you talk to me.\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, what do you mean?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI just... I just want to present what I want, and then you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200792\">can tell me whether you\u2019re going to do it or not. Or counter-offer something else. I think that\u2019s just the best way to do this.\u201d So he said, \u201cFine.\u201d We\u2019re supposed to have dinner tonight, so... (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">It\u2019s an interesting relationship. We\u2019re very friendly when we see each other and when we\u2019re with Brady. We signed up Brady for soccer, so we\u2019ll be at soccer stuff on Saturdays, but... In regards to the other stuff, it\u2019s very like, serious, so... But it\u2019s not like, nasty. It\u2019s just serious. And I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B1\">this could be worse, so... I\u2019m just hoping that I\u2019ll meet with her, she gives me the list of things that needs to be addressed, send it to him, see what he says, and hopefully he just agrees to it. You know, at this point, you know... I\u2019ll go to court if he still doesn\u2019t agree to stuff. I mean, I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B2\">want to, but I will if I have to. It\u2019s a matter of like, a couple hundred dollars. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking him for like (chuckles)... you know. All this crazy money! It\u2019s just like a few hundred dollars more a month, so... I hope he\u2019ll agree. And... So yeah. We\u2019ll have dinner tonight. I haven\u2019t had <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B3\">dinner with him in a while, with Brady, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2007A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007D\">THERAPIST: So you\u2019re waiting for that, and you\u2019re just waiting for him to start paying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F\">CLIENT: I need him to send me a check.

(pause) Yeah, he needs to write me a check or something. (chuckles) I mean, my lawyer <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F1\">was saying that the calculations that were made had daycare included. She was like, \u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t even be included, because daycare is only going to be another 14 months, you know.\u201d So she was like, \u201cIf you take daycare out of the equation, he actually owes you $1250 versus $900 a month, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2007F2\">know? That makes more sense, for the next 15 years of, or for however longer Brady\u2019s life\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you a judge would agree with that, so...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20081\">THERAPIST: 19 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20083\">CLIENT: 19, because he\u2019s 20 , yeah, it\u2019s 23.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20085\">THERAPIST: Yeah, when it\u2019s 23, it\u2019s (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, I forget (inaudible) 23. So she was saying, you know, \u201cThat amount shouldn\u2019t even be in the...\u201d I didn\u2019t even think about that. I was like, \u201cOh, that makes sense!\u201d Because she was like, you know, \u201cIf you\u2019d gotten divorced next year, then the calculation would be vastly different,\u201d you <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200871\">know. So, and she was like, \u201cWe know that\u2019s going to end at a certain point, in September of 2015.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20089\">So that\u2019s a big deal. If I could get that much, that would make, that would just like, make things so much easier. And just like, the debt that\u2019s just sitting there, you know. I try to make minimum payments and he gives me half, but it\u2019s just nothing. You know, I just have credit card people calling <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200891\">me. I tell them what\u2019s happening and they understand, and they make a note, but they keep calling (chuckles) me. Someone else keeps calling me. So, I just want it to get that. I mean, I\u2019m hoping... all the finances will be settled this year, you know. He\u2019ll re-finance, he\u2019ll write me a check for things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B\">You know, he still owes me... And that was the other thing. I said, you know, \u201cYou owe me for the condo.\u201d I was like, \u201cCan you give me some of that money?\u201d (chuckles) And he won\u2019t. So, there is this thing you can call, that you can do. It\u2019s like an emergency like, order for someone to give you money, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008B1\">your future-ex to give you money. It\u2019s like, if someone like, can\u2019t pay their rent or something. So, I was going to ask her about that, to see if there is something... that can be done. (pause) So yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It does seem a little crazy. He\u2019s going to eventually have to pay it, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F\">CLIENT: Well, and I said that to him. I was like, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re going to have to pay this retroactively.\u201d He was like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, you do!\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, how do, who says?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, my friends who are getting divorced said (chuckles), <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F1\">you know, they\u2019re...\u201d I said, \u201cI have friends in, I have a friend in divorce who, her hus , her ex has to pay her retroactively and is giving her money every month and they\u2019re still and they still haven\u2019t like, signed their document, you know. Like, you know, by law, you\u2019re supposed to give me something, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F2\">and you\u2019re not giving it to me.\u201d You know, my friend was like, \u201cYou should call him a dead-beat dad!\u201d Like, I don\u2019t want to start throwing like, terms around like that, but... She was like, \u201cEssentially, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, you know. He\u2019s just like, denying you the money he\u2019s supposed to be giving you.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20091\">(pause) So, hopefully, I\u2019ll meet with her tomorrow and she\u2019ll have some good... insight into it all, so... Well, I think I just, yeah. I am like, so it\u2019s like, with that, finances, feeling lonely. It\u2019s like a few things that are just like... there. I mean, overall, day to day, it\u2019s good. Every day, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200911\">it\u2019s good. But there are some hard days. And it\u2019s hard, being gone from my family, too. It was just like, being with them and then leaving them, that was hard. That was really tough, because it was...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20093\">THERAPIST: There was comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20095\">CLIENT: Oh, my God, yeah. I mean, they were like cooking for me... or just like... you know, just like being able to be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to my Mom\u2019s house today.\u201d Like, and hang out with my Mom or my Dad. It\u2019s like, I can\u2019t do that. So... I mean, it makes me want to like, go back and visit them. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200951\">But then it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t have money to go back. It\u2019s just like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20097\">(pause) You know, this weekend is Mothers\u2019 Day, so I was trying to figure out like, what to do. I was like, I guess it will just be me and Brady. Then my best friend, Blair was like, \u201cCome to DC.\u201d She\u2019s a mom. She\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019ll have the weekend together, stay at our place, we\u2019ll go for brunch for Mothers\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200971\">Day.\u201d So, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s perfect, because it\u2019s like, my first Mothers\u2019 Day like, on my own, first single mom\u2019s Mothers\u2019 Day, so...\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20099\">It will be nice to like, take a drive with him. My friend from work is riding with us, too. She needed to go to DC, so she\u2019ll be in the car with us, and hang out with my best friend and her family. It will be a fun little weekend getaway, so... So I\u2019m not feeling like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re having a depressing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200991\">Mothers\u2019 Day!\u201d (chuckles) You know? (pause) So, it\u2019s been kind of up and down. It\u2019s still overall good, it\u2019s just, there are some down moments, I think, so... I\u2019m just trying to work those out. I just want to get some things resolved, you know. I want to enjoy the summer and... not eat frozen dinners <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200992\">all the time. (chuckles) So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Because of the convenience factor? What\u2019s the frozen dinner?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D\">CLIENT: (laughs) I know exactly how much it\u2019s going to cost and it is a convenient thing, although I\u2019m trying to cook a little bit more. I\u2019m just trying not to like, go out to eat, basically. Not that I was drinking a lot, but my friend and I (who are training for this race), we decided not to drink <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D1\">this month, like for the month, just because we were spending money on like... You know, I just, I was like, \u201cI need to, I can\u2019t spend money. I\u2019m like, really broke.\u201d So she was like, \u201cLet\u2019s just not drink any drinks, any alcohol at all, so...\u201d You know, because that adds up, if you go out for like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2009D2\">two drinks or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2009F\">So, I\u2019m doing that and... I\u2019m trying to be more... I think (and I think I\u2019ve said this to you in the recent past), I just tended to avoid thinking about money, because I knew it was a stressful thing, so I wasn\u2019t really even thinking about it. Now I\u2019m at the opposite, where I almost, I have to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2009F1\">about it like, daily to make sure I like... Like, how much do I have in my account, how much am I spending like, what do I have to pay, like I\u2019m very... conscious of it now. So that gets a little stressful, but... As long as I pay my rent, and as long as we have food, we have electricity and water (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N2009F2\">and a phone; that\u2019s it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A1\">My parents, if I really needed to... I mean, my brother, when I left, he was like, \u201cIf you need anything, let me know. If you get in a bind,\u201d is what he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a bind, let me know.\u201d I don\u2019t want to pull that card yet. I want to try to get through this. On my own, somehow. I haven\u2019t asked <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200A11\">my parents for money since I was like, in college, so I don\u2019t want to have to ask them. I mean, they did buy me furniture, I guess, but... I want to try to get through it on my own. Maybe. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A3\">THERAPIST: It seems like, when I think about it, it\u2019s like leaving college all over again or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A5\">CLIENT: It is! Do you follow \u201c[]\u201d? It\u2019s this website where this photographer goes around and just like, sees people on the street, takes their picture, and asks them a couple of questions. It ranges, it\u2019s very cool, it\u2019s a very cool site, but... One of the ones this weekend was, (chuckles) it was this <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200A51\">woman, who\u2019s sitting on a stoop and she\u2019s like, she\u2019s like, \u201cIt really sucks to have to ask your parents for money at 45.\u201d I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s so true!\u201d (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A7\">You know, you want to be like... I mean, I feel successful in my job for sure, thank God. But... you know. It\u2019s like, embarrassing to have to like... Not embarrassing. They\u2019re not going to like, make fun of me, my parents, but it is weird to be like, \u201cI can\u2019t really afford that, or I need to borrow <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200A71\">like, $500 if you have it.\u201d So... I just need to like, I just need to get the money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200A9\">Then I can like, square things away, you know. Pay my credit card, pay you, pay things that I\u2019m like, outstanding, you know. Mediator, I owe her a check, so, I\u2019m trying to like, pay like, a little bit at a time like, $100, can you take $100 now and then, you know... (pause) It will work out, you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200A91\">It\u2019s just, I have to be more careful. I\u2019m hoping biking will save me on gas. That would be good. Plus I like to do it, so it would probably make me feel better than sitting in traffic (chuckles).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200AB\">THERAPIST: I mean, I can see it\u2019s very much on your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to figure out ways to... to cut cor , you know, to save money. (pause) But, we\u2019ll see. Maybe he\u2019ll write me a check soon, maybe next month. I keep thinking that. Maybe next month! I was like, maybe May. Now I\u2019m like, maybe June (chuckles) he\u2019ll write me a check. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Would you ever want to get a different job that might pay more?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562588\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200B1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what he said to me. He was like, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t make that much!\u201d And he was like, \u201cIt\u2019s your choice to stay working there.\u201d I considered getting a second job, when I don\u2019t have Brady. I love my job. I feel like it\u2019s rare for people to say they really like their job. I love my job! I <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200B11\">would never want to leave it, no. And I know I don\u2019t make that much. I have a review coming up. Hopefully, they\u2019ll give me something. But... I don\u2019t want to go somewhere and hate my job, to make more money. I just, it\u2019s the one, it\u2019s like, the one thing that like, I\u2019m so happy with, besides Brady.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Am I sounding like Rich? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200B5\">CLIENT: No! (chuckles) No, I mean, it\u2019s a good question. I mean, especially if I didn\u2019t like my job, I would be like, \u201cOh, my God! Let me go somewhere else, but...\u201d But I\u2019ve considered like, \u201cOh, well maybe, when I don\u2019t have Brady, I can work at a retail store,\u201d although I\u2019ve never worked in retail, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200B51\">but... I could work in some store or... I don\u2019t want to work in restaurants again. It\u2019s only work. I could do that, but then it\u2019s like, it would have to be like, every other week, when I have... It can\u2019t be during the day. It would have to be at night like, during the week or on weekends. But I could <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200B52\">probably find something, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200B7\">(pause) I\u2019m not there yet. (chuckles) But I would do it, if I had to. At least I hope I don\u2019t have to. (pause) And I\u2019m going to sell the ring. I found a place that will auction it for me, so... I can get some money from that. Not as much as I hoped, but... I\u2019ve asked like, five jewelers, five places, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200B71\">and they\u2019re... This is the one that\u2019s giving me the best quote, so... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I think I was asking that, in part, to sort of see if you felt empowered to be able to make money, if you wanted to and make more money if you wanted to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200BB\">CLIENT: Um... (sighs) Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200BD\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you have other... you have other priorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019ve worked there, because... Like, we always say the people that work there, work there because we don\u2019t care about money. Like, we all want to make money, but we work in marketing because we like what we do, you know. Yeah, I could totally find a job. You know, I could find a <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200BF1\">job that paid me more. (pause) But I\u2019ve just gotten to a point in this job, where I\u2019m really... like... I run the marketing on a show, like on a documentary series, a really well-known, [] show, and it\u2019s like, that\u2019s huge! And I love my job! I love my co-workers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C1\">I mean, I started off as a secretary there, you know, 13 years ago. My boss now is kind of like, \u201cRun it. You know, run that side of things.\u201d You know, and that\u2019s huge! That\u2019s like a huge... thing, career-wise. I feel like, next year I want to ask for marketing director, which is basically the highest <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N200C11\">title you can get in that kind of line. So that if I do really need to find a job somewhere different, I mean I don\u2019t, I would have that title. I\u2019m like a year away from getting that title, and I want to get it. (pause) I just, I love my job. I love it! It\u2019s great! I love waking up in the morning and going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C3\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah! I feel very lucky. I know I\u2019m one of the lucky few that can say that, because I know a lot of friends that don\u2019t like their jobs at all. So...

Like, it sounds like it\u2019s not. It\u2019s something that\u2019s, you like it and it\u2019s something that\u2019s important to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200C9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, do I, I mean, I think if I put my resume out there, I could get hired pretty... pretty easily. I mean, I say that, being really cocky about it, but, I think I could get hired and get a bigger salary, for sure, or a little bit more than I make now. (pause) I just don\u2019t want to leave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200CB\">(pause) That\u2019s why it would almost be like, \u201cI\u2019ll take a second job somewhere else, so I could stay there.\u201d (chuckles) But... I mean, I\u2019m making enough. I\u2019m just getting by right now. I don\u2019t have enough to pay bill , like to pay extra things. Like, I have enough to pay my rent, my utilities, eat <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200CB1\">food, you know, buy him some shorts, you know? (pause) That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have... to like, \u201cOh, make a big payment to this and like, make a big payment to that, or buy this for my apartment.\u201d I don\u2019t really have that. (pause) But I mean, he\u2019s going to write me money. He\u2019s going to give me money, at <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200CB2\">some point. It\u2019s just a matter of when.

I mean, Brady is sitting with us, so I don\u2019t know like, how appropriate it is to be like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s with Brady?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah, so like... we usually just kind of talk about what\u2019s going on like, oh... You know, our lives in general and stuff with Brady, so... We don\u2019t really discuss... I think we did it once, when he came over to get him. I think Brady could tell that we were... Because I was kind of getting upset, <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200D71\">and then Brady kept kind of interrupting and like, try to say funny stuff. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Lighten the mood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. So then, I just was like, \u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about this.\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d Because we don\u2019t really fight in front of him, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200DD\">THERAPIST: He knows what\u2019s going on. (client affirms) He can sense when there is tension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200DF\">CLIENT: Yeah, he can sense that I\u2019m getting upset, you know. Or sad. So, it\u2019s good to have, I mean, I mean before I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do these dinners. They\u2019re awkward.\u201d But last night, he was like, \u201cOh, so tomorrow\u2019s Wednesday.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d And he was like, \u201cAre we going to do dinner?\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N200DF1\">And I was like, \u201cOh!\u201d Because we haven\u2019t done one in like, because I\u2019ve been gone or, you know, travelling or whatever. I was like, \u201cUh... Sure, I guess!\u201d (chuckles) And he was like, \u201cOkay. We can go to Panera.\u201d I was like, \u201cAll right.\u201d So... It\u2019s good for Brady to see us together in a nice way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Well, (both chuckle) good luck with that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E3\">CLIENT: Thanks!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N200E5\">THERAPIST: So, I have you down for next week, and then I have you down for two weeks from that.
