Today\u2019s my day off. I had an extra-long weekend. I had Friday off, today, Tuesday, so I\u2019m very relaxed. Oh, hold on. That\u2019s my mom. Yes, it\u2019s been really nice and I\u2019ve made it a point to see people so I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of friends. And Brian\u2019s actually been very attentive so that\u2019s been <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">nice. And after this I\u2019m going to go to dinner with two friends right here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh yes, right around -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yes. We\u2019re kind of all on budgets and thought where can we get a cheap burger?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Yes, and it\u2019s good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yes, so, yes. I don\u2019t have much to talk about today because things are going okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s a different kind of day to be here, yes?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes. I was thinking a lot of financial stuff was on my mind because I started off the weekend, I think it was on Friday that I went to go get an oil change and the guy you know how they always try to get more money out of you? So he says oh do you know that your car is due for this and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">and that? And he gave me the whole bill and it ended up being $1,500. Yes, I was panicking but thank goodness I was out to breakfast with Brian and he kind of calmed me down saying let\u2019s think about this. You don\u2019t drive a lot. It seems like I need two front new tires and I didn\u2019t know this because <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B2\">Alabama doesn\u2019t have inspections. But I guess if your tires are really crappy that you won\u2019t pass the inspection. So I\u2019m a little worried about that; I\u2019m going to go try to get it done tomorrow. Hopefully <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: The inspection?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yes, but hopefully the car guy, the oil change guy was just exaggerating a little bit because I can\u2019t afford tires right now. I had a really good meeting last week with Henry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Oh yes, yes, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yes. He\u2019s looking to kind of I guess use his office space as evening hours because they don\u2019t really work in the evenings. And so I\u2019m trying to get a group together and he\u2019s going to try to see if people are around for the summer. And I figure since I\u2019m not on any panels yet and I\u2019m not yet <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">quite ready to jump into private practice that would be a good starting point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Oh you\u2019ll work under him? Once he gets back -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yes in his group practice. But it would only be once a week, 90 minutes. It\u2019s not a huge commitment and that\u2019s what I want. I don\u2019t want to be hauling over to the Square twice a week for lots of hours. But I need extra I need some cushion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yes, well what would be a regiment be? How would you, how much would you ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Well I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t gotten that far?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: they take so many. They take so much for the percentage, I think it\u2019s 40 to 60 or something. But in the long run, 10 weeks if I get 60 [inaudible at 00:03:32] that would get me over a grand. And for me that\u2019s a huge cushion so if I have that going while I\u2019m working on finding a sublet and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">stuff like that to have a patient or two, that would be nice. It feels weird that I\u2019m at the point in my life that I can do that kind of stuff. And Henry was so funny. I trust him and I\u2019m comfortable with him and so he was kind of teasing me in a way because he said what\u2019s going to be worth your while <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">to come over here? What if you only have three people show up or something? So we did the math and he said okay, that comes out to about $700 and I said yes, yes. He said you\u2019re not making enough money. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And then we got to the point where he just very truthfully asked me how much are you making? And I told him and he basically said, and I guess I knew this I had just forgotten it, that in a group practice you\u2019d be making about $80,000 a year, and I\u2019m guessing in a private practice that\u2019s just all of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">your own. You\u2019d be making even more than that or as much as that. And I\u2019m thinking to myself what the hell am I doing at GWU? So that\u2019s started in my mind but I can\u2019t imagine leaving, at least for another few years, I love it so much there. And I, I mean knew that I wasn\u2019t ready to dive into anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">on my own yet. I didn\u2019t I guess I had applied to a few group practices and I have interviews that were upcoming if I hadn\u2019t gotten the GWU job but just, there was something about the community aspect of it and the coworkers and just being on different committees and being part of the university. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">damn $59,000 a year compared to $80,000? That would be a big difference. So <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: How many hours would you say you put into GWU?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: 9:00 to 5:00 and then once a week I run that group and so I stay 5:15 to 6:45. I could run it in the middle of the day but that would make it harder because client hours are so important and during certain times of the year it gets so booked. And then I don\u2019t take any paperwork home. Once in <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">a while we have presentations but it\u2019s just, it\u2019s not a lot of preparation. It doesn\u2019t feel like work there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">I\u2019m learning a ton. I don\u2019t know if I told you this but last week I got my annual review, I think I did. And so I had the meeting with the director and the associate director and they just give you so much feedback about your growth. And I get supervision still. It\u2019s called peer supervision. And I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">going to get to supervise next year. It\u2019s just all this stuff that I wouldn\u2019t be getting if I were alone in a practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: Oh yes, yes, yes. There\u2019s a lot of fringe benefits, [inaudible at 00:06:43], other benefits than pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: And just they\u2019re really invested in your professional development and right now I feel like that\u2019s where I\u2019m at and that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. And I want the feedback and I welcome it. So, I guess I\u2019m making the conscious decision to just struggle for a little while. I know I don\u2019t want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">be like my coworkers. I was talking to some of them that have private practice. Some of them work so hard. There\u2019s this one lady that lives about an hour and a half away and she comes into Hamden, she gets there at 7:00 a.m., sees a client 7:00 to 8:00, and then goes to work, and then commutes all the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">way back home. And then some nights, some days she comes in at 9:00, works, and then goes to private practice in Hamden and then goes home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">And this other guy does private practice almost every night after work and he doesn\u2019t get home to his family until 11:00. Fricking long day. I know I don\u2019t want to work like that; I just want quality of life. And thank goodness it\u2019s just me now; I can\u2019t imagine if I had a family to support. So I\u2019m just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">thinking maybe a few more years of this and then transition into private practice. I feel like I\u2019m just getting my feet wet, with this group. Henry already, he taught me kind of how it works. Just it felt like a crash course just telling me about the notes, and the theme and just simple things that <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">nobody teaches you that stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">And then if I start one or two patients on my own, that would be a little bit more cushion. The tax money is running out slowly; I\u2019ve had to get a little because that was my cushion for a long time because I filed very early. And there\u2019s all this stuff coming up like going to get my car done. Suddenly <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">it\u2019s new tires and let\u2019s not forget the two cavities that I have that I\u2019ve been putting off because I don\u2019t have the little bit of money that my insurance doesn\u2019t cover, or the malpractice insurance that I\u2019ve been putting off. I know that\u2019s not much but it just, it all adds up a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Oh yes. No, it does. I mean that\u2019s $59,000 is tough to live and lost (ph) on that. Just is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: It\u2019s ridiculous. And it\u2019s just, it makes me sad that little holidays pop up here and there like Easter or this long weekend that I could\u2019ve gone home and I can\u2019t go home and visit. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to go home and visit. My family\u2019s just so miserable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: Why, what ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: My poor mom. I think I mentioned this to you last time that she had a few days off for Passover and stuff. And she wakes up at home on vacation and she calls me up and says I haven\u2019t been able to stop crying as soon as I wake up in the morning. Did I mention this to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t remember about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: And I was right away I thought of my students who often come in and say to me I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. When the semester was really busy I was fine and I was studying 24-7 and now that it\u2019s calmed down I\u2019m so depressed. It\u2019s because you have time to think and reflect. And so I asked my mom, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">well what\u2019s it been like for you on Monday through Friday? And she said I don\u2019t have time to think. I just run to work and then I\u2019m exhausted when I come home. And now she\u2019s home and just wakes up and Billy\u2019s there, and Billy doesn\u2019t have a job and she has to kind of face reality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">I feel so bad for them. It feels very strange. I\u2019ve been saying in here just my career\u2019s going up and more opportunities are coming my way and they\u2019re just stuck. It\u2019s really very sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Yes, I think each kind of possibility for you to kind of earn more or potential for not just earning more but to do anything that kind of advances yourself it\u2019s almost like a kind of a certain element of melancholy is associated with it. It makes you reflect about how your family\u2019s stuck. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">It\u2019s a simultaneous way of it goes in tandem with these experiences in your life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yes. I haven\u2019t heard from my dad; he hasn\u2019t called. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because he\u2019s not too proud of the way his life is going right now. He probably never found a job. He lives with his mom what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: You said he won\u2019t call. He can\u2019t call if he\u2019s feeling that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I assume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: But I mean, yes, so you notice that he won\u2019t call when the chips are down or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: No, I mean the last contact I had with him I remember he said how much do you owe on that car of yours? Tell me the number. And I have Billy still bothering me with can you file that police report, I need to get those $80 from his car break-in. I don\u2019t know what he does with all his time. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Good question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: And my little sister, she lives with them, she calls me today and says hey do you have a minute? I\u2019ve been really depressed and I don\u2019t know why. Yesterday I\u2019m just crying for no reason; what\u2019s wrong with me? Like I can just magically give her the answer. But I mean I can imagine. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">that living in that house. Just kind of dreary and depressing. And the poor thing, she still wants to be a speech pathologist and she has this plan to get her AA and then somehow go to UGA; it\u2019s about half an hour from my house. And my parents are totally against that idea. And I hate that they don\u2019t -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: The thought of going to UGA?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yes. They have dreams of oh you need to go away to New England to be in a college. You need to go GWU or something. She\u2019s not going to do that. And Billy called me after my oil change actually and I picked up the phone and he said hey listen so we want to send Carly (ph) (ph) up there for the <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">summer. How long do you think you could hold her up there? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Hold her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: I said you mean like how long do you want her to stay with me? Yes, there\u2019s this acting workshop through Yale that I want her to do. I\u2019m thinking how can you afford that? It\u2019s probably expensive and she doesn\u2019t even want to act. And he says could she stay for about a month with you? And I said <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">yes, that\u2019s fine. You know, just appeasing him even though I know I\u2019m going to talk to Carly (ph) and that\u2019s not going to be the story. And I did talk to Carly (ph) later and my sister says to me don\u2019t pay attention to Daddy. Daddy\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m not going to any workshop. I\u2019m coming there hopefully in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">July to visit you for a week and then coming home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes. No it\u2019s something, he has this kind of, some sort of grandiose kind of fantasy of what\u2019s possible. And actually she\u2019s kind of trying to really reckon with what -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Reality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">THERAPIST: with what, yes, what\u2019s possible, really possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">CLIENT: These are my realistic options and then he said something like we want to get her away from this riff raff down here in Augusta and get her in a more cultured place where she\u2019ll be able to meet people who actually think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Why [inaudible at 00:14:28]? Was she they want her to be you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: It\u2019s funny because I made it. That was their dream for me originally I think to go to where Billy came from. He grew up in Chicago, Northwestern, well he grew up in Delaware but then -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: He went to Northwestern?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: He went, no, no, no. He grew up on the Delaware Shore and then for his senior year they moved to the big fancy house in Northwestern and he went to high school there. And then he went to the Florida State for one semester and then dropped out. So I think that since I was little, my parents kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">of wanted me to go away to New England somewhere. You got to go up North that\u2019s what they always said. And it didn\u2019t work out like that because I ended up staying there for college. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t apply back then. I probably could\u2019ve made it in but I just I guess I wasn\u2019t ready. But eventually <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200752\">I made it up here. And all my friends are professionals and they love that; my mom\u2019s always bragging about that. Oh, all her friends are psychiatrists and psychologists and they have all these degrees. And here\u2019s Carly (ph) hanging around with people who go to community college, who want to be techs, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200753\">medical technicians and stuff like that. And they think that that\u2019s trash. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">So I was thinking about what we said in that session a few weeks ago when remember I was talking about if I mess up who\u2019s going to drive the boat, like the boat\u2019s going to sink? I was reminded of when my little sister called me and she had been talking to my mom about how my whole family, my mom\u2019s brothers <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">got together for a barbecue and they didn\u2019t invite my mom. And Carly (ph) started talking kind of like my mom and she started saying things like who do they think they are? I heard that they just get together and drink and get drunk and smoke marijuana. They\u2019re so trashy; for God\u2019s sakes, you\u2019re a doctor. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">[Laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">And I\u2019m thinking, first of all, yes I get that my family is different and they do that stuff and none of them are professional. But I don\u2019t sit there and talk about them that way. And when she says comments like that it makes me think holy crap, Billy\u2019s not a professional, my mom\u2019s not, Carly (ph)\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">not, so I\u2019m the one that somehow holding them up or something. If I mess up, that\u2019s not acceptable. I\u2019m supposed to be the put-together person who\u2019s a professional, who\u2019s made it. So when I think back to situations where that drunken afternoon, no way. That\u2019s like that\u2019s what that made me think of. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200792\">And when she said that on the phone I almost felt like myself putting my head down because that had just recently happened. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Oh I see. Yes, so yes, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s kind of steering the ship towards something better than what they -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: And so if they knew the truth but I\u2019m both. I have messed up like that but I do have it together as well. I don\u2019t know if I truly can believe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Well something too about it, about a certain kind of real strong, really strong feelings and kind of almost like a disgust around the roots, certain roots in the family. Around like drinking too much, trash, can\u2019t be that way. That -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Low ambitions <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: low ambitions, yes. Low ambitions, right, right. We can\u2019t be like that; that\u2019s going to be our ruin. And yet there\u2019s something also kind of like, as you\u2019re sort of saying, they, that means they don\u2019t have contact. They disavowed that side of their lives, their roots, their -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: But yes, I\u2019m the only one out of our little family that is what they are trying to portray. They live in this huge fricking house in Augusta. It\u2019s not new or anything. It was built in the 70s and but it\u2019s in a beautiful neighborhood where people do have money to kind of fix up their houses. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">It\u2019s a really nice neighborhood and it\u2019s right across the street from a middle school that\u2019s very good. And I\u2019m sure the houses in our neighborhood could sell for a lot and I\u2019m thinking to myself what are they doing living there? Everything for them is just facade; know what it looks like on the outside. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20084-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20084-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">Yes, so I haven\u2019t been tempted to mess up in any way. I haven\u2019t drank yet, I\u2019m nervous. Every time I\u2019m out in an event that people could be drinking I get not nervous but just a little unsettled because I don\u2019t yet have the urge to drink anything but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m scared of. Like for example <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">today\u2019s Monday and so I went for my little jog earlier today and I passed all these house parties and people were drinking. And I passed by some restaurants where the patio decks were opened and people are eating and having a beer and it was sunny and I thought ooh that would feel good. I\u2019d like a beer. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200872\">But then I\u2019m telling myself no, you shouldn\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">And it\u2019s not like I have a fear that I\u2019m going to have a beer and that\u2019s it; it\u2019s going to get out of control because I\u2019ve drank plenty of times and it\u2019s been fine. But here I am getting ready to go to dinner with my friends and I might feel like having a beer and a burger. But I\u2019m nervous about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Yes, that you\u2019d be tempted to mess up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Brian is very extreme and he doesn\u2019t drink. At the most he\u2019ll have a beer rarely. So he kind of made me promise just don\u2019t drink. And I almost feel like I\u2019d be lying to him or something. And I agree; I\u2019m in the process still of finding a psychiatrist because I don\u2019t know how it <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D1\">interacts with my Zoloft. And any kind of crazy -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: What anything ever happened to those names I gave you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: You gave me one name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: Just one. Okay. Over oh yes, one on that side. Anything happen with it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: Because of all these expenses I\u2019m just postponing, postponing. But I\u2019m going to I mean that\u2019s still on my to-do list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: I always only ask because I wanted to know how it turned out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Yes. No, I\u2019ll let you know when I find someone. Anytime I\u2019ve messed up in any major way it\u2019s involved alcohol. And my friend Patrice has her 30th birthday coming up and she wants to go to the Hotel and I know that\u2019s going to be a night of drinking. I went out; I went out this past weekend Saturday <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200991\">night, with Patrice and a bunch of our friends, these guys that sometimes we go out with, and they were all drinking. Patrice never drinks; she just she\u2019s got a lot of medical issues so she just, she goes out and has fun without drinking. And I didn\u2019t have the urge to drink and I told myself well <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200992\">if I feel like having a glass of wine or something maybe I\u2019ll do that. But at the same time I\u2019m trying to save money. If I don\u2019t feel like drinking don\u2019t drink. And I ended up drinking water all night. And I was fine and I had a good time. I\u2019m just so scared to mess up again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s I mean I think there\u2019s just, like we\u2019ve been talking about there\u2019s just so much to that experience of quote, messing up, right, that really emerges for you. It gets categorized as messing up but it\u2019s something that is really powerful of how I\u2019m suggesting it\u2019s a substantive feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">or state of mind that we\u2019re yet to really fully understand but we know, I mean we\u2019re really learning a lot about it. Like, just all of the it wasn\u2019t just the drinking and isolation right that day with James. It was so much more. It was so much about feelings and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">CLIENT: My friend Patrice who I was supposed to see that night, remember because after the concert I was going to hook up with her and my other friends. I finally saw Patrice for the first time in a long time this weekend and so when we were just sitting there on Saturday night I kind of gave her a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">little bit more background. And she was saying everyone I\u2019ve told this story to they say Melanie, it doesn\u2019t sound like it was just the alcohol. There was a lot going on emotionally. But I guess what scares me about it is that I didn\u2019t realize that all that was brewing. So how do I not know I now <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D2\">have something brewing?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yes, I hear you. It\u2019s about how scary that whole side that just kind of came out of nowhere was. Almost like what the hell happened? I would remember it. What did I did that whole time, that side of the experience, yes. Oh yes. Yes, and a fear of getting in touch with it again but I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">it means something. And I think it has something to do with I think a lot of something about, I mean I don\u2019t know, something about the feelings about these roots. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">CLIENT: I was thinking after I told Patrice this whole thing, she\u2019s very supportive and understanding, I was thinking about the examples I\u2019ve had growing up. And I remember just a few years ago I actually think that it was just in the recent, the past two or three years because I think I remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A11\">telling you this, that my mom went out to happy hour with her friends from work, ended up drinking too much, threw it up on the front lawn and my little sister saw her and she called me up crying. Like making a spectacle she\u2019s a grown woman, my mother. And it doesn\u2019t surprise me because I saw my mom <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A12\">doing that stuff. I saw my mom with her brothers and my cousins and aunts at parties growing up where they were getting drunk and dancing and getting inappropriate. Inappropriate in front of an eight-year old, like Billy would come out dressed up in my mom\u2019s lingerie. Not to be silly but it just seeing <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A13\">them loud and rambunctious and drunk <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Yes, something about forgetting the temporary kind of suspension of all kind of senses of what this could impact or what it means or you know. To somebody it\u2019s just a free, almost like a free-for-all getting into something about themselves, throwing caution to the wind, just letting themselves <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">just completely go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yes, and there was never not in front of the kids or go to your room. I\u2019ll never forget the party where we were serving them drinks. I was in third grade; I was 10 and my cousin was 12 and she ended up getting drunk because she was tasting the drinks. And she was sitting on the toilet passed <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">out with her head back, I remember, and my parents were just trying to take care of her but they weren\u2019t in a panic or anything. We just thought it was funny. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">They could\u2019ve gotten the cops called on them. She was 12 years old. And then I have all these memories of my dad just getting drunk and emotional. He would get so emotional when he\u2019d pick me up from my mom\u2019s and he\u2019d start crying your mom wants to keep us apart, or there was one time I spent Christmas <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A71\">Eve with him and they had guests over. And he ended up getting so drunk he spilled the pot of soup over in the kitchen and burned himself and the guests had to go home. Then my grandma had to put his pajamas on.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A9\">And then when Sasha, my other sister that we share Dad with, she used to get picked up for the weekend from him. I remember her calling me and complaining that oh my mom got mad at Dad because he was drunk when he picked me up. You know, just all this stuff. When I look at it that way it\u2019s kind of, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A91\">it\u2019s kind of a miracle that I don\u2019t fuck up more or that I don\u2019t drink all the time. I mean I did for a while. I think back to college and the beginning of grad school but that was a little bit more developmentally appropriate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yes, no and I see it like this. I think that what really spooked you about the whole, that whole showing up to Brian\u2019s place right that in some way you felt that, you knew it kind of scared him or something. It brought out this side of you or you felt like oh I did something that crossed <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AB1\">some sort of line to him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AD\">CLIENT: When I showed up on his doorstep?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes. And that that really but it was a way I think, one way of thinking about it was one way of you telling him about, something about how, something about your life about you wanting to tell him about what you\u2019ve experienced and can he take it. Can he take it, can he understand? Does <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF1\">he want to know that in some way? Not that it\u2019s a conscious kind of thing but I think it\u2019s implicitly showing him another side. Which I think is what is something that was in action around the situation with James. Someway that you were trying to show him this isn\u2019t, I\u2019m not just in this category; I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200AF2\">somebody else. And I\u2019m scared of losing it. Can you take this other side of who I am? I\u2019m going to [inaudible at 00:30:38].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know how Brian, of course he doesn\u2019t like that side and it\u2019s dangerous and he lectures me when I do something. But he doesn\u2019t reject me for it. He\u2019s been so close and attentive lately and I\u2019ve seen him so much. That girl never responded to me because I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B3\">THERAPIST: You spooked that one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B5\">CLIENT: And I talked to him about how the note doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s a year old. And he still swears, he says I swear to you it\u2019s from you kept saying the girl\u2019s name like I was supposed to know who she was; I don\u2019t. That was a long time ago. And I told him I don\u2019t know if I just don\u2019t care or if <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B51\">I\u2019m willing to start fresh and have everything out in the open. And I don\u2019t know what it is because I\u2019m not sure if that was really over a year ago. Strange that he still had it in his glove compartment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B7\">But he\u2019s also been making more of an effort. Like sometimes he\u2019s I think last week and the week before he\u2019s seen me twice in a week. He never used to do that. On Friday that I didn\u2019t have work, he picked me up from the oil change place, took me to breakfast, took me to Target because I needed to get <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B71\">something to hang up a frame, helped me put up the frame. We spent a regular day together and we never get to do stuff like that because our schedules don\u2019t coincide. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B9\">And then after that he had to go home to write a paper or something but then he said I could come back tonight. And he came back that night and slept over. And I knew that he had a busy weekend. He had to go be with family for Easter. That\u2019s the part where it gets weird because he tells me all about <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B91\">the family drama. He doesn\u2019t get along too well with his mom and he was anticipating that she would be very passive aggressive. And he called me from the car and I said oh so where is Logan? Oh they\u2019re in the car behind me, following me, because he had to take off and go to work after the Easter party. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N200B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BB\">So I\u2019m so close yet so far away. I\u2019ve got this image; he\u2019s sitting in the car on his cell phone talking to me, telling me all about the party he\u2019s going to with his family, and then they\u2019re in the car behind him following.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes. There\u2019s something kind of that has to remain almost compartmentalized about this other element that\u2019s happening. Is that right, is that ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just weird. I\u2019m in it but I\u2019m not. I haven\u2019t even met his son yet and he was telling me I was just asking so what\u2019s it going to be like, who\u2019s going to be there, who are you looking forward to seeing, just letting me into his life. And then later when he got to work and he was in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200BF1\">parking lot he called me again. And then he worked 7:00 to 7:00 and then woke up this afternoon and then called me when he woke up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C1\">And we\u2019ve just been very we\u2019ve been doing a lot more communicating. Like Friday when he was over, so we went out to breakfast, we did our stuff and then we ended up going back to my place and having fun. But then that night when he came over we were both really tired and we never don\u2019t do anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C11\">physical when we\u2019re in the same room together. And we were just he was telling me he felt like cuddling and we were just laying side by side, holding each other, talking until we drifted off to sleep. And it was so nice. I feel closer to him since this happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C3\">It\u2019s still weird, though, when I talk to my friends about it. We\u2019re out with these guys and they\u2019re friends of ours and we\u2019ve been friends for over a year now and they know about him. And I don\u2019t know how they know the details, I must\u2019ve told them some stuff, but one of them asked me so have you met <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200C31\">his son yet? And I said, oh what a stab to the heart. Don\u2019t ask me that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C5\">THERAPIST: What did it, yes, what did it, what was the stab yes, can you see?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C7\">CLIENT: That it can\u2019t yet be normal. That it\u2019s still weird. I actually kind of wish I could tell people he\u2019s married. Does that explain it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Well that, too, seems like, right, something that you\u2019d feel has to be -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CB\">CLIENT: Like another side of me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD\">THERAPIST: another side of you. A determined very private side of I mean almost like you describe it as a, to use your family\u2019s way of thinking, like a side that your family would see as kind of a quote trashy or something. Is that ? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">CLIENT: Oh my God. My mom, I don\u2019t know what she would think. I remember her telling me about my cousin who got kicked out of his house that he was sharing with friends because he was sleeping with a girlfriend\u2019s or the guy\u2019s wife or whatever. And the history, you know, my grandmother and all that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF1\">I could never let them know that. I haven\u2019t even let my mom know that he has a son or that he\u2019s divorced, which if we stay together eventually I\u2019d have to tell her that. And she\u2019d consider that strange or bad. Why would you go with a guy who has baggage? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes. Just says so much about how she must sound so [inaudible at 00:37:23] herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200D0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D3\">CLIENT: I\u2019m trying to care less and less about what she thinks but it\u2019s hard. After the breakup with James I told you that the first thing that came to my mind is damn my mom\u2019s going to be so disappointed. I have to live off [inaudible at 00:37:43]. I found his Chapstick under my bed and I had this <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200D31\">momentary fantasy of me oh imagine if I had picked this up and burst into tears. That\u2019s not happening. It should or something but -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Yes, but not, you couldn\u2019t see a feeling of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D7\">CLIENT: No. You know if anything I can call up Kevin more. I don\u2019t what it was but I did some more Facebook spying and they\u2019re still together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">THERAPIST: Did they get married? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB\">CLIENT: No, they\u2019re engaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DD\">THERAPIST: They\u2019re engaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DF\">CLIENT: But I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m waiting for. That one day I\u2019ll look at Facebook and the mom\u2019s going to have pictures posted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Of? You\u2019re friends with her is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E3\">CLIENT: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Okay, you can see one of their Facebook -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E7\">CLIENT: Yes, sometimes you can see certain well I\u2019m still friends with his mother and his sister. And once in a while I\u2019ll [inaudible at 00:38:50] the events. Yes. Oh, I thought you meant her like the fianc\u00e9e.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200E9\">THERAPIST: Oh no, no. I .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EB\">CLIENT: So yes, once in while for family events and stuff they\u2019ll post pictures of everybody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200ED\">THERAPIST: Right, right. That\u2019s how -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF\">CLIENT: She just, she looks like a baby. She\u2019s 21; he still looks giant with a beard. And he just turned 33. What would I think if I had a daughter that was 21 being with a 33-year-old man who\u2019s still an undergrad? I don\u2019t know why I do that to myself. I think it\u2019s lots of things. It\u2019s how could I have <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200EF1\">wasted so much time. That feels like a different person, a different life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F1\">THERAPIST: What, but what does what does the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F3\">CLIENT: But also things come up like if Kevin knew about what happened at St. Patrick\u2019s Day weekend he\u2019d say I told you so. You\u2019re not going to find anyone to take care of you. I knew you\u2019d keep on troubling with those kinds of problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F5\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re not going to find anyone to take oh, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F7\">CLIENT: I mean James walked away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yes, no I can appreciate though the bit about the kind of impact Kevin seen that that side of your life and responding to it. Taking care of it to you seems to [inaudible at 00:40:37].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FB\">CLIENT: And it still bothers me that he found someone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FD\">THERAPIST: What about it, yes? How are you thinking about it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200FF\">CLIENT: It makes me, I know that this is not the reality of it, but it makes me feel more messed up. Like okay he must\u2019ve been the normal one or the healthy one if right away he was able to find someone. And look, they\u2019re still together and he, look at I\u2019ve had all these hook-ups and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20101\">THERAPIST: Oh because he\u2019s found somebody, he\u2019s with somebody he\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20103\">CLIENT: Yes. And I\u2019ve had James who I totally part of me thinks I completely messed that up. And now I\u2019m with a married guy. When I really take time to sit and reflect it makes me think I\u2019m damaged or something. But when I\u2019m just living life and just distracted and things are going okay with Brian, <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201031\">it feels better. It feels almost healthy and it\u2019s okay. But now that I\u2019m sitting here talking about it and I feel messed up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20105\">THERAPIST: Messed up. What made you think, feel messed up? Or what is it that\u2019s messed up?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20107\">CLIENT: I know probably that the relationship isn\u2019t perfect and I knew Kevin the way he was when I knew him and he\u2019s a disaster. And I know no one\u2019s relationship is perfect. But I\u2019ve never had something normal because I was always hiding Kevin, my parents didn\u2019t approve, and now my next major relationship <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201071\">is a married guy. I have to hide that; my parents wouldn\u2019t approve. And then I found James who my parents would totally approve of but I fucked it up. Not that I even wanted it to work necessarily. He was a good guy just a lot of stuff was missing, it was moving too fast, the passion wasn\u2019t there. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201072\">makes me think that maybe I\u2019m attracted and wired for the dysfunctional and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20109\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Well putting it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010D\">CLIENT: That I don\u2019t think about this all the time. That\u2019s a lie; I do but just not as deeply as I am right now because right now it\u2019s making me really sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2010F\">THERAPIST: What are you noticing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20111\">CLIENT: I just want a healthy, normal relationship and I think I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m not capable of that. [Pause] I mean because there it was in my face. James was a potential healthy relationship but always swat the minty (ph) ones. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20113\">THERAPIST: No, but I guess I\u2019m wondering, yes, there is this thing that you do describe of feeling as you\u2019re talking today there\u2019s this line of I feel good about the way things are going with Brian; I feel okay about it. And then it kind of moves to a very different tone where you start to feel very <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201131\">sad and kind of like you\u2019re fucked up or something. And it seems to hinge around at least two things I was thinking about. One is that when we talked about, when you talked about if your mom only knew, then what would she say about me from your standpoint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20115\">And then also when I was thinking about something that I said about it also led to that kind of feeling. Something about me bringing up this something to the effect I said something like you\u2019re looking for something in Brian that you\u2019re not getting in these other places, something to that effect. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201151\">That had an impact on the shift that <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20117\">CLIENT: Yes, I\u2019m not sure when the shift happened but suddenly something drastic happened and I started feeling really sad. I thought it started coming up when I started talking about Kevin. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20119\">THERAPIST: Oh yes, okay. It\u2019s associated with Kevin and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011B\">CLIENT: That was my experience but there you are looking at me so maybe it looks different from your side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011D\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2011F\">CLIENT: I felt it kind of sink in -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20121\">THERAPIST: With Kevin. Oh, okay, okay. [Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20123\">CLIENT: But that just, that was a young relationship but it lasted 13 years. And it wasn\u2019t healthy. And I haven\u2019t had good examples of healthy relationships and I mean look at now what I\u2019m drawn to. A married man. [Pause] I\u2019m just scared that it\u2019s always going to be dysfunctional like, I feel like James <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201231\">was my opportunity for something healthy and I said ick. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20125\">THERAPIST: Yes there were those icky kind of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20127\">CLIENT: Yes, when he would look at me a certain way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yes, yes. No, I think yes, it raised a lot of stuff but there\u2019s also something about both Kevin and Brian. And I think in different ways they respond and you feel kind of understood and Kevin got that kind of the drinking stuff. And you felt cared for and he would just kind of look at you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201291\">and say what were you thinking? But it wasn\u2019t condemning; it didn\u2019t sound like he thought it was trash. He didn\u2019t see it that way. He didn\u2019t conceive of it that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N20128-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20128-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2563471\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2012B\">Brian doesn\u2019t see the kind of, the interesting, in a certain kind of erotic experience, the sexual experience as upset in fact he relishes it; he welcomes it. He wants it; he wants to know that. Does not see it as trash. And I think you felt like you weren\u2019t sure about James. Certainly in the I <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N2012B1\">mean I think in either sphere, either in the kind of the element of yes, this other side of me comes out and it kind of scared him off.
