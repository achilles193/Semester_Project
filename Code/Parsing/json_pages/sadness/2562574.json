I\u2019m calling Protective Services for my grandmother. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done with these fucking people. I don\u2019t care if my uncle never talks to me again. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been dealing with. That was my whole day yesterday. So instead of having a nice snow day, I had to deal with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">these assholes again. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m going to Assyria, but I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not going until this is taken care of it. I\u2019m going to take care of it and I\u2019m going to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Did something more happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I think just years of my biting my tongue and just being patient. Somehow in the last two or three days, combined with everything, I\u2019m just so fucking broke. It\u2019s my fault. My account was fine for a couple of days and then I totally forgot I paid the guy to fix my heater.  I paid him like a <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">week and a half ago or whatever it was. He just cashed the checks today. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I have my personal issues that we all have. This other shit, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m just fucking done. My aunt is a fucking lunatic. My poor grandmother is out in the hallways banging on neighbors\u2019 doors saying she wants <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">her daughter to go home. My aunt has no patience and says mean shit to my grandmother. She\u2019s basically freeloading. I don\u2019t want to say it like that, but that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re homeless, but figure it out. And then, of course, my mom has to deal with their shit every day. I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">done. Fuck this, including my mom. If they\u2019re all too whatever they are to take care of this . . . Yet again, I\u2019ve been sucked into this and I\u2019m going to take care of it. That\u2019s all. One call to Protective Services is all it takes. Then something has to be done. (pause) I wrote a text to my uncle yesterday. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">I tried to be diplomatic. I was like, \u201cLook, you seem unwilling to deal with this properly. I\u2019ve urged you a number of times. For whatever reason, you seem kind of unwilling. It\u2019s a completely deplorable, disrespectful situation that my grandmother . . . \u201c And that\u2019s what I started doing. I started <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">calling her \u201cmy grandmother.\u201d It\u2019s not about all their weird little neuroses, it\u2019s about this woman\u2019s proper day-to-day care. They\u2019re such fucking losers. I\u2019m like this is a deplorable fucking situation and it\u2019s undignified.  So I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything so, yet again, I\u2019ve been dragged into <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">this; and it stops today. I\u2019m calling Protective Services. You do whatever you want, but this stops today. This is completely unhealthy stress levels for my mom. I\u2019m being dragged into it. You can tell my aunt she\u2019s a fucking nut job. We\u2019re done. This is over now. That\u2019s it.\u201d Of course, he writes back. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200117\">He just doesn\u2019t get shit. \u201cI\u2019ve restrained myself in the past when you\u2019ve attacked me. (sniggers) I\u2019ll tell your aunt to leave your mom alone.\u201d This has got nothing to do with \u2013 what is this, high school? It\u2019s not about leaving people alone. They\u2019re just fucking idiots. They\u2019re just such fucking morons. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200118\">So I was like, \u201cDude, are you kidding me? This is not an attack. I\u2019m telling you logical things, very logical points, to no avail, over and over. This is about me standing up for my grandmother.  That\u2019s all this is. As for my aunt, forget about telling her to leave my mom alone, you can tell her to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200119\">not be a freeloader. You can tell her to stop saying mean things to my grandmother and fighting with her. You can tell her to get some therapy or something, but this is completely unacceptable.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve said many times that your mom shouldn\u2019t deal with this if she doesn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001110\">up to me what happens to her. There are three of us.\u201d I was like, \u201cIt is completely up to you. How dare you? Putting this on a 72-year-old, exhausted, weak woman and her mentally fucked-up sister? It\u2019s totally up to you. My mom told you months ago that she came to the logical, common sense acceptance <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001111\">of the reality of the situation and something needs to be done. The caretakers have complained several times. So you can go fuck yourself. Now you have to do something.\u201d  He was like \u201cgoodbye,\u201d like he doesn\u2019t \u2013 go fuck yourself, man. I don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019ll be the bad guy for my grandmother. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001112\">great, actually. I mean I have a headache and I\u2019m enraged, but I also feel great. It feels so good to finally just say what\u2019s what and that\u2019s it. We live in a great state where you can call very nice people who are experienced in these things and they take care of it almost immediately. That\u2019s all there <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001113\">is to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20010-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20010-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562574\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20013\">THERAPIST: Something empowered you to finally step up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just done. I\u2019m just done. I\u2019ve been telling you that for a while, right? I\u2019ve been telling you family things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: You haven\u2019t done it, so I just wondered what\u2019s different this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just about a build-up. I\u2019ve been patient, patient, patient, patient. This aunt really put it over the top. My grandmother is in her own filth, for Christ\u2019s sake.  And my aunt\u2019s stupid comments. \u201cOh, your nose is getting long. You look so ugly.\u201d What the fuck are you talking about? It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">your fucking mother, man. Are you crazy? Enough is enough. It\u2019s absurd that this is even happening and I told them, \u201cThere is no reason that it had to get here. This is completely unnecessary that this has happened and now we\u2019re at this point. I\u2019m sick of this family\u2019s utter inability to logically face <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200192\">things and deal with things. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m just done. You can go do whatever the fuck you want, but my conscience is clean. My mom\u2019s conscience is clean.\u201d I thought my mom was going to get upset. Like in the past I\u2019ve told you. \u201cWhy did you tell your . . ?\u201d She\u2019s very relieved. That\u2019s how done this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200193\">woman is.  She doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m (chuckling) probably not going to talk to my uncle for quite a while now. She\u2019s just done. My God. They\u2019re not done because they\u2019re guilty. One is just trying to throw money at it and the other one is just a mental case who thinks no one should get old and die, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200194\">guess, but that\u2019s not our problem. It\u2019s not our problem. God, man. The community is stunned. Everyone knows my mom. Everyone knows us. They\u2019re all like what is going on here? I told my mom, \u201cYou have nothing to . . . Hold your head up high. All these people are your friends. This nut job has no friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200195\">here. And he has no friends other than the people he once in a while hangs out with at Starbucks. They\u2019ve got nothing. They\u2019ve got nothing. You have your friends. Go hang out with them and spend time with them.\u201d  Fuck this, man. Are you kidding me? An embarrassment. So I called them and I wrote a long, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200196\">fucking e-mail to myself. Which one should I list, the part where she almost fucking died in her apartment almost and was taken to the hospital? The doctor was appalled that she was living alone. They made him the proxy and they said, \u201cThis woman needs proper care now.\u201d Nothing happened. Yeah, okay, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200197\">he paid some woman. That\u2019s all half-assed shit. They\u2019re not going to work for a woman that\u2019s shitting her pants. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s quite shitting her pants, but whatever is going on that she\u2019s so smelly, who is scratching people, throwing stuff at peoples\u2019 heads. We\u2019re done. We\u2019re beyond that point <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200198\">of some nice Assyrian ladies taking care of her.  My God. (pause) What a fucking pussy.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562574\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B\">I told my cousin yesterday, \u201cIt\u2019s you and me in this family. You and I are the only people \u2013 I called you, I told you what happened, and now we\u2019re having a civilized conversation. You understand. You get it. We\u2019re the only two people in this family like this.\u201d I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t keep faking anymore with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B1\">people. I\u2019m done. These people are a complete drain of my energy, including my mom. I love my mom. She\u2019s the best out of all of them, but still I got involved in this because she can\u2019t \u2013 yeah. And they get it. Lately she has. She\u2019s called him a bunch of times. He\u2019s been avoiding it. The women have been <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B2\">calling him to complain and he\u2019s avoiding it now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D\">I don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on. He told my mom, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do now, kick out my sister from there?\u201d It\u2019s like a complete cluster fuck. I don\u2019t care. Are you kidding me, that\u2019s what a pussy you are? You\u2019re the man of the fucking family. You have the means and you have the language <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D1\">skills, the savviness, to take care of this. You can\u2019t tell your 65-year-old sister that she has to get her shit together? Pay for an apartment for her. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Grandmother is not going to suffer because of that, you fucking idiot. He\u2019s a fucking moron, man. \u201cBobby, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D2\">her son, is working for me now. Now I\u2019m stuck.\u201d You\u2019re stuck? You\u2019re going around buying mansions? This fucking bullshit is making you stuck? \u201cHey, Bobby. You told me you were going to be here temporarily. Now it\u2019s been well over a year. I\u2019m sorry. I can give you three more months. I want to do it, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D3\">but I can\u2019t.\u201d Really, it\u2019s a half-second conversation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">What gets me about that, that\u2019s the part where my mom \u2013 she doesn\u2019t want to go there because it\u2019s so hurtful to her. And I understand, but I have to. So he\u2019s concerned about all of this shit, but not his oldest sister? Go fuck yourself. Are you kidding me? It\u2019s not enough to say, \u201cI\u2019ve told her. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F1\">shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d This isn\u2019t like some kind of high-school social club, if she doesn\u2019t. They call her all fucking day. It\u2019s like harassment. The fact that this is even having to happen and I have to get worked up about this and talk to a shrink about it and tell my friends about it, where are we living? <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F2\">Are you kidding me? There are plenty of Assyrian families who, of course they don\u2019t want to put their parents in nursing homes, but I don\u2019t know. They have a common-sense gene or something. \u201cYou know what? When Regina starts smelling like a homeless person and she\u2019s chewing her food and putting it back <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F3\">in her pocket, I think it\u2019s out of our hands now.\u201d  I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s just a gene that goes off in peoples\u2019 heads. It\u2019s not huge. You can\u2019t just show up whenever you want. Just take her into your fucking house, dude. It\u2019s all easy. It\u2019s so easy. Huge house. Take her and put her in a room, get a <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F4\">nurse, and then you\u2019ll feel all righteous that you didn\u2019t put your grandmother in a nursing home. Why aren\u2019t you doing it? Oh, because you don\u2019t want to deal with a crazy person 24 hours a day. Oh, I see. Okay. But Ginny and even my crazy aunt, these people should be with her 24 hours a day. Go fuck <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F5\">yourself. (pause) Assholes.

I\u2019ve been this mad about it. I have. I\u2019ve just been chewing on it. What could I do? Remember when I would say something that I\u2019m the bad guy; and then they\u2019re out having pizza together again the next day. You know what? I realize it. What does this mean? They\u2019re not going to talk <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200231\">to my mom? Great! Fucking awesome! Don\u2019t come over. Don\u2019t call her. She doesn\u2019t want to have fucking coffee with you. Go fuck yourselves. And guess what? They\u2019re going to put her in a nursing home like that. (snaps fingers) Like that. (snaps fingers) When my mom is not in the equation, like that. (snaps <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200232\">fingers) One of them is a nut job and one of them just doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. So go ahead. Or \u2013 you\u2019re homeless? Rent them a nice two-bedroom apartment and put them in there together then. See how that works out for you.  They have mice in their apartment, man. It\u2019s just insane. The people are <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200233\">going to come in there and be like, \u201cWell, yeah. Clearly . . . \u201c Down the list: Mice in the apartment; a daughter living here illegally for months in the building \u2013 a Section 8 building you\u2019re not allowed to do that; clearly, the woman can\u2019t reply to anything about what she wants or what she doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200234\">want; neighbors all witnesses. And a grandson who is a witness to this day in and day out for years. (chuckles) It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to show up and be like, \u201cEverything seems okay here.\u201d (pause)  Pathetic people. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20025\">Luckily my one cousin is like, \u201cThank you for doing this. You and your mom are right there and you\u2019ve had to put up with this shit. You did absolutely the right thing and I appreciate it. I know that that\u2019s hard, but it seems like if no one did anything, nothing was going to happen. The woman was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200251\">going to die in her filth.\u201d That\u2019s all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: This is your aunt\u2019s daughter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, my aunt who passed away. She was like, \u201cI have been kind of removed. I have two kids. It\u2019s been hard.\u201d I told her, and that\u2019s the problem, too, that they don\u2019t get. They\u2019ve ruined our opportunity to have these last years with our grandmother in a controlled environment.  Don\u2019t feel bad. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200291\">I don\u2019t want to see grandma either. When she comes over I quickly give her a hug. I try not to breathe, and I go upstairs. How am I supposed to interact with my grandmother? While the woman is saying semi-normal things like \u201chow is school?\u201d or whatever, she\u2019s dropping things on the floor and there is <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200292\">shit in her pockets and she smells like shit. That\u2019s not normal. You go to a nursing home where, yeah, my grandmother is nuts now, but she\u2019s in a controlled environment. She\u2019s safe. These people know how to deal with this. I can go and, yes, it is uncomfortable. It is weird, but it\u2019s controlled. This <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200293\">is insanity so, of course, you don\u2019t want to deal with her. I don\u2019t want to deal with her either, but that\u2019s not our fault. We\u2019ve been forced into this pathetic situation.  They\u2019ll kill her in a nursing home. You know what? She\u2019s dying. I told my mom, \u201cI cannot believe I\u2019m forced to say this kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200294\">shit to my elders. You\u2019re a bunch of morons.\u201d I told her that. I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re a bunch of completely, mentally-ill weirdos. Do you think I\u2019m not going to die? You\u2019re not going to die? We\u2019re all going to fucking drop dead \u2013 today, tomorrow, 80 years from now. The woman is 90. I think she\u2019s had a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200295\">good run, okay? She\u2019s dying anyway. Do you want her to die in her own filth? Or would you like her to die in some semblance of dignity? Are you nuts? Am I telling you to put her in a jail? Fucking go. Go sleep next to her in the nursing home all day. If you care so much, put her in a nursing home \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200296\">a really nice one \u2013 and then fucking go there all day and be self-righteous and look after your mother.\u201d  He\u2019s not going to do it, is he? And he knows he\u2019s not. That\u2019s probably another thing. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be in a nursing home and I\u2019m not going to visit her.\u201d You\u2019re guilt is not my problem. It\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200297\">my fucking problem. It\u2019s not my mom\u2019s problem and not this sick person\u2019s problem. (pause) Fuck.

He shows up once in a blue moon and has a coffee or whatever. \u201cOh . . . the economy . . . the <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2002D1\">Baltimore zoning board won\u2019t let me build my golden gate . . . \u201cWhat the fuck?

If he\u2019s somehow like, \u201cWhat the fuck? I\u2019m helping my aunt and now my sister needs my help. I\u2019ve already helped this. I helped him go to school. I gave the other one a job.\u201d Don\u2019t help. If that is what this has become, no one needs <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2002D3\">your help, bro. No one needs it.

When I woke up I heard my mom yelling from downstairs. I go down and it\u2019s the fucking poor health care girl, the Assyrian.  She was like, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore. She\u2019s scratching, she\u2019s clawing.\u201d She threw a videotape at her head or something like that. And she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200311\">like, \u201cAnd your sister has made this a million times worse.\u201d That\u2019s what she told her last night. \u201cYour mother went to all the neighbors\u2019 doors banging and yelling that she doesn\u2019t want her . . .\u201d I was like that\u2019s it. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I immediately knew that if I don\u2019t do anything right now, absolutely <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200312\">nothing is going to happen. My mom\u2019s day is ruined. My aunt there is losing her mind or something. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. And again, ultimately, the most important person, the elderly person who has a sickness, is just in her own filth, wandering hallways, banging on doors. Wow. Wow.  So I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200313\">like \u2013 no, we\u2019re done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20033\">THERAPIST: So right away you e-mailed him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20035\">CLIENT: I just texted him.

This situation stops today. Period. I\u2019m going to report it to the state Elder Protective Services. This has been a pathetic, disrespectful, and totally mishandled situation for well over two years and I\u2019ve urged you more than a few times to deal with it properly.\u201d Done. Done. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200352\">He took that as an attack, of course. Then I just said, \u201cAttack? All I\u2019ve done is make logical points to no avail. Give me a break. I\u2019m standing up for my grandmother, who has been made to live in an undignified way for more than a few years. What you need to tell my aunt, instead of telling her not <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200353\">to bother my mom, is that she can\u2019t freeload at my sick grandmother\u2019s apartment.  She needs to stop yelling at her and saying mean things to her.\u201d I guess she\u2019s also been gossiping about my mom. I guess she has said a few things like, \u201cGinny doesn\u2019t want us in her house anymore,\u201d which is not surprising; <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200354\">but that just added. Really? Go fuck yourself. Normally I don\u2019t care about gossip, but man, you\u2019re being a little bitch. You\u2019re being a little bitch. I said, \u201cThe caretaker has tried to complain a number of times to no avail. I\u2019m sick of this family\u2019s utter inability to deal with things head on and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200355\">in logical ways. The decision IS up to you. My mom signed off months ago when she logically accepted the reality of the situation. How dare you put this on a weak, 72-year-old woman who is exhausted and tired of this insanity and on my aunt, who is clearly selfish and mentally questionable?  We\u2019ve gotten <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200356\">to this absurd point totally needlessly. Others are totally baffled at how this has gone on like this for so long. It stops today.

It\u2019s like, dude, the woman has done nothing. She has bent over backwards for you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2003D1\">lunatics. Do you think this is something about bothering my mom? I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s very liberating. I\u2019ll take the headache. It gives me some anxiety, but I really don\u2019t care. It\u2019s like a rush.  I don\u2019t care. It feels great. I told my mom it\u2019s sad, but has he been calling me anyway? She was like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2003D2\">\u201cThis is bad now. He\u2019s not going to let this go. Your relationship is fucked up now.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat relationship, exactly?

I said, \u201cYou know what? <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2003D3\">We\u2019ve helped him a lot, too. If we\u2019re going to play games, my dad would just write him checks.

My uncle is a nouveau riche, douche bag. That\u2019s what this guy has become. They\u2019ve had a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2005F3\">of things at their house where they didn\u2019t even invite their sisters.  The list goes on and on. This has been building up a long time.

Or the guy that has abandoned his dying sister in L.A. or the guy that doesn\u2019t keep in touch with his <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200632\">elderly, dying aunts?  You had a nice dinner with him? Oh, that\u2019s great.\u201d That\u2019s all douchiness. That\u2019s all fake douchiness. What am I supposed to do here? We\u2019re either going to pretend or this is what\u2019s going to happen. Someone is going to speak their mind and go on with their lives. I don\u2019t need this <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200633\">shit. But also call them out on it instead of just keeping \u201coh, you saw Pedro? That\u2019s great.\u201d (pause) Morons. Absolute fucking morons. The good thing is this will never happen again. This situation, this was the last of it. It\u2019s sad, in a way, but this will never happen again.  However much longer my <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200634\">mom has \u2013 I hope a long time \u2013 and for me. It\u2019s just done and I don\u2019t have to put up with this shit anymore. I\u2019m going to constantly follow up with Protective Services and make sure that things are being followed through. That\u2019s all. It took me a second. This whole thing took me a second to deal with.

I just couldn\u2019t. I was so exhausted and my head was throbbing. I called Protective Services. I\u2019ll just tell her tomorrow. I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m just exhausted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2006D\">THERAPIST: You could tell me something big was happening that was really distracting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2006F\">CLIENT: I figured I was going to see you and I would tell you. Sometimes when I\u2019m in those moods, just saying things, even a few words, was giving me a headache yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20071\">THERAPIST: You heard me have feelings about you not calling me? You heard my second message?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20075\">THERAPIST: It just made me wonder a little bit. It\u2019s not like you to, if you can\u2019t make it, not to call; to tell me in advance. It just made me wonder what was happening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20077\">CLIENT: I was so caught up. Your first message I thought was like \u201cdon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not coming in.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20079\">THERAPIST: I said, \u201cJust make sure and call me if that\u2019s the case.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry. At that point I was already completely beside myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007D\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s something, too \u2013 how absorbing this can be of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2007F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the other thing. It was really cute, actually. For the first time my mom was like, \u201cAre we too sensitive? Is it us? Are we too sensitive about this that we keep being the bad guys?\u201d I was like, \u201cMom, we\u2019re sensitive about your mom\u2019s and my grandmother\u2019s well-being. Yeah, we are sensitive. <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2007F1\">You know what? It\u2019s because we\u2019re artists.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20081\">THERAPIST: But we\u2019re appropriately sensitive. It\u2019s better than insensitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20083\">CLIENT: And I said, \u201cAlso because we\u2019re highly intelligent, sensitive, artistic people. You\u2019re dealing with a fucking \u2013 he might as well be a cigar-chomping business guy with his shitty dockside (laughs) . . . He\u2019s like a caricature now of, I guess, what he\u2019s always wanted to be and your sadly lunatic <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200831\">sister.\u201d I really feel bad for my aunts. Something is not right up there. It\u2019s not my problem anymore. She has two fucking children. Shame on them for not dealing with this. This is not our problem. It\u2019s not my uncle\u2019s problem, either, but \u2013 whatever. He is the man of the family and he has the means <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200832\">and he has hired her fucking son. Sorry. Deal with it. I\u2019ve thought about that, too. Why am I so worked up? I think that\u2019s why I did this. I was like you know what?  I\u2019m going to keep being worked up about this and I\u2019m not going to fucking Assyria while this is nagging \u2013 calling my mom and I just want <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200833\">to have a nice conversation with my mom and she\u2019s fucking exhausted and she\u2019s pissed and complaining about this or that. This has got to end. You know what I mean? I was like if I am this worked up, then you know what? You can do something about it; otherwise I\u2019m being just like my mom. And yeah, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N200834\">am worked up. I get worked up about things that are unnecessarily and irrationally a certain way. It drives me insane. It drives me insane and I can\u2019t not call it out eventually. Is that what you\u2019re asking?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562574\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20085\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean being worked up because it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re having an overreaction, Brian. You\u2019re having an appropriate reaction to something really crazy happening, like you\u2019re the only one left owning reality in this.  But it made me think about what was happening yesterday that whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200851\">that emotional experience was that it took over calling me or even thinking that coming in might have helped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20087\">CLIENT: I did want to come in. I did want to come in, but that was just a reality of being able to get the fuck out of my driveway and all that. No, no, no. I was going to come in if the roads were clear and all that. Honestly, that\u2019s a weird day, the day that I\u2019m calling Elderly Protective Services <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200871\">for my grandmother. It was just years and years of pent-up shit that I was just in that zone. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it and I think that\u2019s pretty normal. I think my uncle is lucky I didn\u2019t tell him to go fuck himself. I think I\u2019ve handled this (sniggers) very diplomatically. Was I blunt and <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200872\">a little bit aggressive? Fuck, yeah, because I don\u2019t know how else to do it.  Sometimes you\u2019ve got to shake somebody. They guy is just not getting it \u2013 and he still didn\u2019t get it, right? So I was worked up. I was very worked up. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20089\">THERAPIST: Not quite. I don\u2019t know exactly what the question is, but there is some sort of \u201cwhere I go,\u201d for example, in your mind when you\u2019re that worked up, that I disappear. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2008B\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t disappear. In a way, I felt relieved. I was like, \u201cShe called, so she gets it that it\u2019s fucked up out there. I\u2019ll call her. I\u2019m in the middle of this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It was more just from interpreting it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was just relieved that I heard from you because I was like fuck, if I don\u2019t hear from her then I have to call her at some point about all this fucking snow shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20091\">THERAPIST: Did you listen to my message?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20093\">CLIENT: I did, but while I\u2019m googling fucking whoever I\u2019m supposed to call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20095\">THERAPIST: Because I was also telling you where to park if you come in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P11-N20097\">CLIENT: I did. I did hear that. I did hear that, but I ignored that because I couldn\u2019t get out. The guy didn\u2019t come to plow or anything like that. I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call her at some point. She gets it. That\u2019s okay.\u201d When you\u2019re in the middle of something so . . . That\u2019s not a normal day at all. <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200971\">And when it\u2019s so pent up, I was completely absorbed because I was absolutely determined to see it through, whatever it was \u2013 a text to this douche bag, calling these mother fuckers, get all the right phone numbers, write a fucking e-mail. I immediately started writing what I remember. It\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N200972\">a lot. Okay. 2:20? Okay. Thank you. Bye.
