(inaudible phrase at 00:00:13)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">I grew up in Aberdeen. Did I tell you that? You know where I grew up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I do. In Aberdeen, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I told you that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Are you going to need a pen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I can grab (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">And I lived in two different places in Aberdeen. The first house I grew up in, effectively. In my mind, I always just think of it as \u201cthe red house\u201d because it was a big red house. And we moved out of that house right after fifth grade and we moved to this much bigger it was actually a huge house, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">it was like a new development, this massive house on the other side of town, but it was still in a sub. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m embarrassed to say though, I don\u2019t know much about Aberdeen. Give me the thumbnail of what kind of town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Not much to know, man. Quiet little suburban town. Really white around the edges. A lot of minorities in the center of town. Very kind of \u201ctown-y.\u201d Not a place I wanted to stay any longer than I had to, really. There\u2019s some nice areas to it, but it\u2019s just a quiet little center of town with businesses <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">that open up and close down every couple months. But pretty standard (ph?), I guess. Just suburban.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: And socio-economically? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: I\u2019d say predominantly middle-class. Lower middle-class around the edges getting towards east-end, Montrose, and Abroath. A little more affluent in areas but definitely not rich or anything by that stretch. Lots of little old capes and split-level houses and stuff. A nice town. PTA\u2019s and stuff. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">People in Aberdeen seem to like Aberdeen the ones that stay there, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Where was the red house and then where was the other house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: They were on polar opposite sides of town. The \u201cred house\u201d was over by one school, which was over in the corner and then the other house was over by the school. The neighborhoods were broken up by what elementary school you went to. It was ineffectual because everyone went to the same Middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">School. I think that\u2019s why my parents waited to move, so I was going with all the same people anyways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">The houses that we moved into, though I hate Aberdeen now. I don\u2019t even like going there. I rarely ever will for anything. Just being there, it\u2019s just I think the town itself has decayed, apart from my own associations with it that I superimpose. I think, just in general, the town has gone downhill <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">a bit. But I just don\u2019t like to be there at all if I don\u2019t have to be, and I rarely have to be. My Mom doesn\u2019t live there anymore, either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Where does she live now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: She lives in Westhill now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Westhill, and your Dad...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Gainesbury (sp?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s right. Inverurie. (sp?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: So, then we moved to this much bigger house. I guess it was probably in the 90\u2019s, when everyone had all this money and everything. A house that was absurdly big for three people. By the time my Dad moved out it was just stupidly big for two people, particularly given all the upkeep and stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">It\u2019s funny, because I always associate the \u201cred house\u201d with my parents being together and the new house the (inaudible), the bigger onewith my parents splitting up. But I guess, technically, my Dad didn\u2019t move out until High School. That would have been maybe four years living there, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559931\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: 9th, and then that summer. I guess, I think even if I went back and looked at it-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Summer of \u201893 is when they split up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, after freshman year. But, I guess, as I kind of explained to you, the extent (sp?) towards that kind of began quickly (ph). And I think for all intents and purposes, my Dad kind of didn\u2019t live really there. You know, if he was out \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Those were the years he was in law school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, in law school or doing whatever he was...He just was very much not living there, at least for how my memory serves it. And I had gone back, sometimes like if I was at Will\u2019s house or something, or if I had to go through Aberdeen for some reason, sometimes I would go and I would drive around <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">and see the second house that I lived in and shit, and I\u2019d go back and kind of just drive around the neighborhood like you do sometimes. You see if they changed the garden or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">But I don\u2019t know when the last time I went to the red house, or the first house, was. That I hadn\u2019t been to for a really long time. But as I explained to you, I think the last time I was here, I had been to the Dentist recently. The Dentist is in Aberdeen, because it\u2019s the place we started going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">when we were in Aberdeen and we\u2019ve continued to go there. Even now we take the commuter rail back to Aberdeen to go to the Dentist. Partially because we have a relationship with them there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">So I went the other week, when I told you that I didn\u2019t have any cavities, but it was like a weird miracle. I felt like they didn\u2019t look hard enough or something. But I had to go back because a cavity they had filled recently had to get reworked on. And I had to take the commuter rail, so I had three <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">hours after I got out of my appointment with nothing to do. So I just started walking around town and I ended up walking-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Three hours to get to the-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: -because I had taken the commuter rail so the next commuter rail back into Boston was three hours. There\u2019s no tier (ph), you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">I started kind of walking around and I didn\u2019t really have any kind of clear idea as to where I think I was going to go, I was just kind of like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m just going to kind of see what has changed.\u201d I ended up walking a decent ways. It was definitely a longer walk than from here to the town square. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">Longer than I thought I was going to walk. I ended up walking right up to my old house. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: The red house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. It\u2019s not red anymore I learned the other day which was really weird to see. I walked all the way over there and right onto the street. I really don\u2019t know the last time I would have even (inaudible phrase at 00:08:44).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">And it was kind of odd because I wasn\u2019t really thinking about it until I got pretty close to it, because I don\u2019t even think I was intending on walking by it. But there\u2019s sort of a point at which you turn off the main road to go toward my house, and it\u2019s a turn that you wouldn\u2019t really take unless you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">were going. There\u2019s a little cul-de-sac, so you\u2019d never be on that street just passing through or anything. It was really bizarre. Really, really bizarre. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559931\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">It was partially kind of bizarre because I felt like I did it without even really saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to go and see my old house.\u201d I felt like I just kind of wandered, like I was sleep walking or something. It was weird. But it was really odd because I can remember right before I got to the turn right <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">onto the street that I lived on, I hadn\u2019t really even thought about it. I was thinking about other stuff, but I started to feel myself getting really fidgety. Like just straightening my pockets out for no reason or just taking stuff out of my pockets and putting it in my bag, or something. I was just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200552\">getting kind of fussy. I think I started to feel nervous. It was really weird. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">I went down the street and went up to the house. It\u2019s on a big hill and I kind of stood down at the bottom and I saw a bunch of neighbors come out that I recognized, actually. They wouldn\u2019t have recognized me because I would have been like 11 or something when I was there. And it\u2019s a super quiet street <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">to the point that if there\u2019s some dude walking around on the street, people would know if you didn\u2019t live there. So they were kind of looking at me like, \u201cWho is this dude just staring at this house?\u201d And I remembered the names of the neighbors and I considered saying \u201cHi\u201d to them being like, \u201cThis <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">is who I am.\u201d They probably would have remembered me. They definitely would if I told them who I was. But I felt weird. I felt really antsy and really, um, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: What came up? What came up for you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I was walking up the street and it was weird. Because it literally, like the way in movies you see someone walking. Like someone in a movie was doing exactly what I was doing and you\u2019d be seeing the movie from their vantage point. And then these little mirages were sort of suddenly (ph) happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B1\">when they\u2019d (ph) walk by a bush or something happened, or like on this corner, they had a memory or something. Something close to that started happening. I remembered the time I was out on my bike with my mom and dad and I was really young, and we were getting close to the house and my Mom started running <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B2\">and racing me when I was on my bike. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">I remembered this time my Dad played a prank on me when I was in the backyard and he screamed at me saying that he fell down and he got hurt and I ran into the front lawn and he had the hose and he sprayed me. Just little things like that started popping up in my head. It was really, really bizarre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Why did it seem bizarre to you? Or what was it that seemed bizarre?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: What seemed bizarre to me was that I think I just said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll go for a walk through the old neighborhood.\u201d You know, just kind of go for a walk through the town square to kill the time or something, but I guess the discrepancy between how (ph) uncomfortable I felt when I got there. I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">really think it was going to be that weird. But it was just really, really, really strange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: It was strange how uncomfortable it was? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Would bring up a lot of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: And I imagined talking about it here when I was doing it. It (inaudible phrase at 00:14:13).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">And I remember I walked back down and kind of around the block. I walked by this place in the woods where there was this huge rock that I used to like to play on. One of the things I noticed too, was everything was smaller. The hill that my house was on used to be like Mt. Washington or something. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">remember shoveling it and bringing trash barrels up it. This rock that used to be like this boulder, I almost looked over it now because it was so small. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559931\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">THERAPIST: So like the house is on a hill on the plot of land so you can look up at it. It seemed farther than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah. If you\u2019re on the street, then it\u2019s a big hill and the house is up there with a driveway up it and then there\u2019s a cul-de-sac and then there\u2019s some woods on the end of it with some trails and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">THERAPIST: On the end of the road?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah, right on the bell of the cul-de-sac.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re where on the cul-de-sac?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not the last the cul-de-sac is a street with houses on each side of it and then the houses stop and it\u2019s kind of like a bell and there\u2019s just woods. There\u2019s trails. Some of them were even paved by the town to walk through and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: But there\u2019s no houses on that cul-de-sac? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: No, not once you get to the bell. But there\u2019s this big rock where I remember When I was young I was really scared of the dark. I never liked to go down to the basement. [It sucks.] (ph)  You have to go to the other side of the basement to turn the light on. You have to be in the dark for a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">few seconds. I never liked to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">I remember one time my Dad brought me out and we got a shitload of candy and we went into the woods and we went and sat on this huge rock that I always used to play on. It was at 7 or 8 o\u2019clock in the summer, so it was still kind of bright out but the sun was going down. And we just sat there and talked <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D1\">and talked and ate candy. And my dad had brought enough candy that I was just on auto-pilot eating candy. And then the trick that he played was then it was us I didn\u2019t even notice we were there in the dark and we were talking and we were eating candy and I wasn\u2019t scared. I was like, \u201cOh, wow!\u201d And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D2\">it was like a Hollywood (ph) moment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">Just things like that, when I would see something I\u2019d remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">THERAPIST: You have these memories, the one with your mother, it sounds like warm memories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: They were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: [I don\u2019t know how you could...] (ph) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah, they were memories of nice things, but which were uncomfortable to arise.

There were beautiful gardens and I have this decayed I thought the house would <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">have looked like that house in Great Expectations that the woman is sitting in with cobwebs everywhere as if time had stopped. But everything was the house was nice (inaudible at 00:18:51) when I was there. People had painted it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: What an interesting fantasy that it was going to be decaying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: That it took that shape in your fantasy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not even like I have a fantasy of that. I realize that I thought that in reaction to how surprised I was that everything was really nice. I wouldn\u2019t even have probably described it like that, if you asked me what that street was like beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20092-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20092-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559931\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">THERAPIST: It was unconscious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose. But not all of it was when I got off the street, actually, I remember I went by a couple places that brought up things that were not super happy. The elementary school was kind of close to there. Just like a 10 minute walk through these very quiet kind of -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">THERAPIST: North? Is that what it was?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah, it used to be called one way. It\u2019s called something else now, after the principal who retired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Doss? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: Named after the principal when he left. They named it after him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">And one of the things that I remembered was the first time that I walked home with a couple of kids from the neighborhood, instead of taking the bus, instead of having my mom come get me. I kind of went up the street and took the turn so I could see my house and my mom was almost at the end of the lawn. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A11\">Almost like she had a leash on and she was trying to she wanted to see me, so that I was okay. She probably wanted to just keep walking and meet me right when I stepped out of the door and that I wouldn\u2019t have walked home alone (ph) and she would have (inaudible at 00:21:10) at me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: You were on your way back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: I was walking home and when I got to the house she was on the lawn looking at me like that. And I remember being not even annoyed in a childish way like, \u201cMom, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Not even like that. But me I was really young but I remember feeling like, \u201cOh God. My mom was worrying about me.\u201d Like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200A51\">oh man. I felt like I was making my mom my mom was upset and I felt like I had something to do with it or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: She was anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know if I thought any of that through, but I just didn\u2019t like the way that that played out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">THERAPIST: So you not liking that kind of feeling that you had of her being there waiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: And me doing it. Me hurting (sp?) her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: And that being because of you? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was surprised. I just assumed she was going to be home when I walked through the door. Oh, man (inaudible at 00:22:30) going on or something? Definitely (ph) the other moms weren\u2019t doing that. Like my mom\u2019s so worried. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">I remembered walking by this is funny, this made me think of you, too the home of this girl who I don\u2019t even remember. I think her name was Ellie or something, but it was her mom that my mom was talking to in the supermarket and who I made that comment to about, \u201cOh, my parents fight all the time.\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B31\">I remember walking by the house and I thought, \u201cOh, wow, that\u2019s where\u201d \u2013 I only remember the mom, I don\u2019t even remember the daughter. I remember that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">And the last thing that I remembered, and this was something that made me really sad at the time, I went by this house where maybe in 4th, 5th or 6th grade I was out trick-or-treating with a bunch of kids in the neighborhood. And we were sort of still at the age where our parents would still go out <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">with us and sort of chaperone, but they\u2019d try to kind of pretend they were off in the distance, and kind of let us feel like we were off by ourselves. I guess we were at this one house. And there was a bunch of us kids, and we were running around and having a blast, and there were a couple of parents <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B52\">out. I don\u2019t even remember who the other parents were. But I remember me and some of the other kids were up at this front door and it was a lawn that had all these funny, Halloween things, like moving, inflatable things and everything. And something happened and all the parents started erupting with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B53\">laughter and I turned around and there were three or four of the parents that were all out kind of watching the group of kids that I was with, and they were all laughing, having a blast, and my mom was off in the corner like...not even one of them; just kind of quietly watching. Just removed. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559931\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B7\">If you just swap those kids, swap the parents out and put nine year old kids, you\u2019d think that it was a like a kid getting outcast at school or something. That\u2019s what it was like to me. I think I was still in elementary school. Well, I would have had to been in elementary school, because if I was in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B71\">that neighborhood trick-or-treating I was still at the house. But I remember being, kind of like that thing that happened when I was walking home, I don\u2019t remember really thinking it through, but I remember just feeling really sad when I turned. I was doing this thing and was having all this fun, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B72\">then I turn around and I saw this and I was like, \u201cOh, God. Am I doing this to my mom?\u201d And I remember I went up to her, I was probably in like the 4th or the 5th grade, and I remember I said to her, \u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d \u201cDo you want me and you to leave?\u201d And she was like, \u201cOh, no, no, no,\u201d of <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B73\">course and kind of brushed it off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">But I remember...it\u2019s funny, because I didn\u2019t really ever remember this until I walked by the house, but I can literally remember the moment when I turned around and saw my mom there and a bucket of butterflies were dumped into my stomach. I was just really I don\u2019t know. Everything else kind of...I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B91\">was ready to just say \u201cF-it\u201d to everything else and I would have gone home. I was 5th grade at Halloween trick-or-treating. It seems like not many things probably would have made me want to go home. I wanted to leave. I was angry at the other parents, or something, like they were excluding her or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Well, you wanted to just take her home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BD\">CLIENT: I wanted to give her a hug or something. It was weird. Weird because it\u2019s something I can relate to, like feeling now, like when I see my mom sick and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. There\u2019s something about the way she\u2019s sick. I mean that in terms of your sense of the aloneness and isolation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (16 second pause) I just remember that night. I remember just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">THERAPIST: It sounds very sad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I was sad, but I was angry, too. I wasn\u2019t like head-down. I wanted to punch someone or I wanted to I felt like I was breaking out of my skin. It was a very kind of pulse-increasing, sadness, anger, etc. It\u2019s not that sadness makes me want to just go to sleep and get in bed...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: You were angry at the parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know what I was angry at.

Nothing in front of me, per se. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200CF\">And that was the last thing that I saw and then I was out of my old neighborhood. The little haunted house ride was all over, so to speak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">It felt like at the carnival, you know in haunted houses you sit in a little car and it brings you through? That\u2019s almost what it felt like. And the other thing that really stuck out to me, and that I noticed at the moment, was I went on this little walk and it wasn\u2019t lost on me that it was effectively <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D11\">stirring stuff up. But then I got out of the neighborhood, I got back onto the main road, and it was just like it was off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D3\">I remembered I walked maybe a block or two and I noticed it was gone. I felt like that would have been something I would have thought about, but I couldn\u2019t get out of my mind. But I think I was walking and for a minute I was almost like, \u201cWhat did I...?\u201d Maybe I was imagining talking to Laney on the <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200D31\">phone. It didn\u2019t even come to me what I did. I imagined, I think, talking to Laney. Like, \u201cOh, you know I\u2019m just walking around in Aberdeen. I went to...\u201d It was gone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D5\">THERAPIST: It was gone.

You don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming,\u201d or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20122-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20122-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559931\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20125\">THERAPIST: It seems to me like it\u2019s somewhat brings up \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d and the woman at the house who does that presumably because she wants to keep things the same. Hold on to something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: Well, Jesus, right? What is that (ph)? There was a party, right, if I remember the book. Was there a wedding? I don\u2019t remember but she had a big dress on. Nothing about it moves from the same. It\u2019s just kind of stagnated (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: Holding on to that and in doing so there\u2019s something about that [love decaying] (ph) and [another way] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s insane. It\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s disconnected from reality. That woman is delusional in the plot because she\u2019s so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s trying to keep something alive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">I was thinking about the idea of preserving something and vacuum sealing it. You never let it have any air. It\u2019s almost like the psychic equivalent of that when you walked out of there. When you walked out off the street. Some sort of seal, hermetically (sp?) sealed or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">CLIENT: Stepping in and out of that really felt like falling asleep and waking up in the same way as sometimes you have a dream you remember it a day later. A day later I was like, \u201cThis is what I did yesterday, Laney.\u201d It\u2019s there. It\u2019s not there. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to dream about until <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201311\">the second before you fall asleep. You don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to be in front of you or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">THERAPIST: It makes me think of the movie \u201cMud.\u201d Have you heard of it? It just came out and Matthew McConaughey (sp?) is in it. It\u2019s a story about two boys who live in Louisiana or Arkansas in the bayou or something. They\u2019re these two kids who like to go out and explore and they stumble upon Matthew <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201331\">McConaughey (sp?) on this island. Turns out he\u2019s on the run and you find out, as the story goes on, that he\u2019s killed Reese Witherspoon is his girlfriend who \u2018s his kind of on again, off again girlfriend and he\u2019s killed a boyfriend that she took up with, or a guy that she was dating because the boyfriend <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201332\">was abusing Reese Witherspoon so Matthew McConaughey kills him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">So now he\u2019s on the run and he\u2019s trying to link up with Reese Witherspoon and he ends up enlisting the boys to help get them back together. And you find out that the woman, the Reese Witherspoon character, is very ambivalent about hooking up with Mud. Always has been, but Mud holds on to this kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201351\">dream of the two of them being together. Just really hopeful that love can work and everything. In time you find out that one of the boys, out of the two, there\u2019s one boy who\u2019s the main character. The other boy doesn\u2019t really get caught up in all this as much as this main boy. You find out that the <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201352\">main boy\u2019s parents are going through a rough time and eventually divorce. He\u2019s trying to hold on to family love and he works his ass off to help Mud (inaudible) this girl back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">(18 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">CLIENT: Real quickly.

Just trying to elaborate on it and try to explain to you the way I think about it just comparing it to that. That scene is different to me because, yes I feel like I\u2019m trying to put boundaries around that neighborhood and those memories and some of that stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201451\">and I\u2019m trying to contain them, but not in a way that you try to catch a firefly in a jar so you can look at it and marvel at it and put it in a box so you can push it under your bed and not have to think about it. In my mind, that\u2019s the way that I think about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20147\">THERAPIST: The Mud story is like -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20149\">CLIENT: Mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014B\">THERAPIST: Oh, your story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D\">CLIENT: Me.

I need to protect it.\u201d It\u2019s more like, \u201cThis is nice, but this is really...\u201d I would be much happier just eliminating this from what I have to look at. Pretend it\u2019s not there. It\u2019s just complicated. That\u2019s just to think <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2014D1\">about, just the thought about how I was feeling about it. I didn\u2019t want to preserve. I wanted to (inaudible phrase at 00:49:01) so I could shoot it into space. Maybe those people (ph) aren\u2019t necessarily proposing (inaudible). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2014F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmmm...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20151\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a good movie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20153\">THERAPIST: Mud? It\u2019s a great movie. No, like the other thing, that element I think it came to mind because something about some different meaning of your It\u2019s just seeing that movie, I think the power of the parents being in love and together and when it goes away what it can mean to a child. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N201531\">any number of ways to react to that.
