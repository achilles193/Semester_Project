You look nice. So earlier, a while ago I got an e-mail from university in Assyria. So of course with everything going on, totally slipped my mind the deadline for the fulltime. Yeah totally. The weeks are just whizzing by. It was November 30th, of course it\u2019s right in the middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">of December, whatever, I don\u2019t know. I just totally lost track. But anyway, so I e-mailed him, I was like I\u2019m so sorry. There\u2019s so much going on on my plate I just completely forgot. It was on my mind, but the deadline completely slipped my mind. Stupid. But anyway she got right. She was like actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">it\u2019s not a really big deal. She was like chances are. She did not really say like we wouldn\u2019t have given, but she was like chances are we would have probably offered you what we are going to offer anyway, you know what I mean? That kind of makes sense. I get that. You know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: But she was like you know, and she was like also there is so much to do it\u2019s really. Don\u2019t worry about it. She was like there are plenty of sections to teach. So basically I will be adjuncting. The only thing I didn\u2019t understand why this is, but she is like I cannot make you a formal offer until <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">you are here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: That makes no sense to me. However, so<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Til you move there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Til I\u2019m there, whatever that means. I wrote back to her and I said well, I said so if you could just tell me, let\u2019s say I taught 3 to 4 classes, what would I make? You know, in terms of I want to make sure if I come there I can live somewhat comfortably. I would want to probably be there sometime <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">in the summer, early summer to kind of get my bearings and whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: And then I kind of asked is there like a red tape reason that you cannot, that there cannot be a formal offer letter? Or what, I don\u2019t know I\u2019m not sure what that is, but that was like, it sounds great if it pays anything like what adjuncting pays here, which I\u2019m assuming it would because it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">a University of Oregon thing. You know? That\u2019s pretty good. I mean even if they are paying let\u2019s say two grand a course. Four courses, eight grand between September and December. Eight grand, so that\u2019s like 2 grand a month right? Two grand a month? I mean if I found an apartment for like $400 or $500, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">without really many other expenses. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m gonna have to talk to people about how this all works. It just sounds like there\u2019s a lot to do. I think she\u2019s basically saying trust me, there\u2019s work, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: She won\u2019t tell you how much they paid before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I just e-mailed her back. I said if you could just give me an idea, and she was nice. She\u2019s like you know if you want I can call you tomorrow. We can talk on the phone, so I gave her my number, and was like yeah sure. I\u2019m mean you know what\u2019s it gonna. I doubt that they would pay like a shitty <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">salary in Assyrian money. Because that does not make sense to me. Because no one that works there is for the most part an Assyrian native, you know what I mean? These are all people that are, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I doubt it too. I just feel protective of you, like not wanting to move there and get there and you have no guarantee.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561582\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not going anywhere, are you crazy? I mean I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t right because I wouldn\u2019t be able too. That\u2019s insane. No of course not. Of course not. The whole reason I\u2019m doing, yes I want to go to Assyria, but I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s totally worth doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: I mean I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: It does not make any sense that they can\u2019t give you an offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: That\u2019s odd. Yeah I don\u2019t understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: They would never get anyone coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what that means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: You have to move here in order too<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Well I guess because maybe for adjuncting it\u2019s not quite the same as offering a full time employment thing. So it\u2019s kind of like that here too in a way. At the very last minute you get a fucking phone call and suddenly you\u2019re adjuncting. I have never had a whole like, yes you know like 2 semesters <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">from now we\u2019re going to offer you this adjuncting. It\u2019s just you show up and they just take one look at your CV, they are like fine. You want to teach 5 composition courses? But I agree I mean I do need specifics. I need to at least know, and also I am going to. If it gets to that point, I\u2019ll be like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">okay so I also want to make sure that I can start getting into a certain mindset and planning. In other words, if there is no real official offer you\u2019re not going to tell me in July that there is no job, or you gave the job to somebody else, or you know. [00:05: 03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Right. Which they could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Which they could. So there\u2019s that too. Because even to get to Assyria I have too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s going to cost money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: It\u2019s gonna cost money to get there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s an investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: You know, so. So that\u2019s important you know. But I mean she is a very up and she seems like a very on the up and up woman. You know, whatever so. I\u2019m not worried, but yeah, I need details. Otherwise it\u2019s absolutely pointless. I mean, you know. So and then I found out that another. I won\u2019t say <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">friend, but kind of a friend, a really good acquaintance from here, also works now at AUA and I think in this department.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: So, and she is really nice, so I\u2019m gonna talk to her as well. And that\u2019s the thing. I think that it could also be this woman is kind of like taking this. She\u2019s really being a little more informal, because she knows that I\u2019m like friends with the Dean, and there\u2019s some mutual people, like so <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">maybe she\u2019s just being a little more like, I don\u2019t know. Maybe she is just being more Assyrian. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Even though she is not Assyrian, I think it\u2019s she\u2019s taken on that kind of like yeah come by there\u2019s plenty to do. You know like well maybe that\u2019s great over there, but I need to know what the fuck is going on. So. I don\u2019t know now it looks like 70% to 80%. I mean if someone is telling you just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">yeah there\u2019s plenty of sections to teach and you know. And none of the sections she said were TOEFL or any kind of ESL. They are still not what I would want, but you know they are writing, composition. Kind of like core courses or whatever, so I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Your heart sounds like it has swung back to towards that being more of a viable possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Well honestly it\u2019s also becoming a practical thing now. I mean this is not good. I cannot, unless I figure out something soon. I don\u2019t, I mean something that is stable and pays decent and I don\u2019t know. It becomes but then yeah it makes me think okay it\u2019s both practical, and maybe it\u2019s just good <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">timing. I have been wanting to go there. It also forces our hand to really take care of this condo bullshit, you know what I mean? So it would be like, all right starting now let\u2019s start planning, sell that fucking thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561582\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Now that you\u2019re moving<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Hold on to it no? Rent it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Uh no, because then we still can\u2019t. It\u2019s about equity. We still cannot tap into anything to buy something. I still cannot do that plan that I have, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: And also it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about also making sure that my mom is very set. You know? So that way, no mortgage, she\u2019s getting that rent. It\u2019s all income. There\u2019s no more. There\u2019s nothing to complain about money wise. You know? And also for me then I can, that equity is there. Who knows <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">maybe I\u2019ll fucking hate it. Who knows, so that when I\u2019m back there\u2019s, we can get to buying something else or. Or not, yeah you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Why would you want to buy something else when you could just hold on to what you have?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Why would you want to buy something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: What is the difference between buying another condo versus holding onto the top floor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Oh well again because my ultimate goal is to buy a number of properties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Umm hmm. So you sell this one and buy another one you still only have 3, Right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: I do only have 3, but it\u2019s all equity now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: But not in the 3rd one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Sure it is. Yeah because I have no mortgage, and I have at least $700,000 in equity. I\u2019m gonna take 3 or 350 of that and just pay cash for another condo. So yes now I have borrowed that, but I have paid cash so now there\u2019s, you know what I\u2019m. Yeah it still is 3 units, but now it is a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200611\">setup kind of, because the idea is to buy that one in cash so that. I know what you mean. Yeah and in a way you\u2019re right too about that. I see what you\u2019re saying. You are buying it completely cash, but then you have fees to that. Yeah, yeah. (pause) Yeah, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: And you are also not using the bank\u2019s money to make money at that point. You\u2019re only using cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Right. Right. Yeah the only way it would benefit would be somehow you buy a condo, don\u2019t live in it, rent it, but then yeah if I\u2019m not living in the house then you could do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Might as well, it would be easier if you really were gonna move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: See the problem is, what bothers me about all that is then I\u2019m still fucked if I need to come back, if I. That\u2019s it I have to constantly stay with my mom, and that\u2019s the problem. You know I don\u2019t have something that is mine, right that I could go okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: That would happen even if you bought another place. You wouldn\u2019t just let it sit there open would you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah but that would be mine. I would be like listen you gotta move. I need my condo in 6 months. You know what I mean? With the house everything is still a fucking negotiation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s good you\u2019re still separated some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah, Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: That makes sense and that\u2019s a separate issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: But more than that, take it we are leaving out one very important thing. Forget about buying another place, the idea is that no mortgage, rental income. Right? What that means is. I\u2019ll even fucking, I\u2019ll live somewhere with a roommate. That would even be more worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561582\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019ll come back, pay $700 a month. I\u2019ll still live in Cheshire. I\u2019ll get a $1500 apartment with somebody, whatever, you know what I mean? But the idea is that there\u2019s cash coming in that now is just ours, and no mortgage. That to me, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s very important to me. Because you <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200791\">never know when you do need that to do, you do need that to buy something or do something. Right now even if you do have that income they\u2019re just not giving it, you still have a fucking mortgage that you are paying off, you know So that\u2019s an issue, you know. Unless you have, you make a lot of money <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200792\">at your job. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s tricky yeah. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not sure. I need to talk to real estate people and really think about what, you know. Maybe there will be a realistic person that\u2019s like no if you rent both those units there are banks that will give you money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: To buy, because you have shitloads of equity, so there are banks they will, I don\u2019t know. Either way, if she comes back and says look this is what they pay, and it\u2019s the same thing as they pay here, it\u2019s hard to say no to that. Especially when look it\u2019s the skin off my back. I\u2019m being paid, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">they\u2019re not paying for my airfare, but in a way they are.

I mean it is and it isn\u2019t. Because in my mind I know it\u2019s a temporary. It\u2019s not like moving to London for a PhD. You know. I\u2019m an adjunct for a semester. In a way it\u2019s kind of awesome. If I like it great. If not, fine. I know that the semester is going to be over, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F1\">I\u2019ll be back for Christmas or whatever, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: But in the meantime it\u2019s a job. I might even be able to save money. Depending on you know. Because the other thing she is implying in her e-mails I have noticed is that not just even teaching at the university, that someone like me there is opportunity. She\u2019s like there\u2019s just stuff here for <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200811\">someone like you. You know you would be in major demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s still a ways away, and in the meantime I need to figure something out. I sent an e-mail to some close friends, and I was like, look it\u2019s getting bad. If you guys, I would really like if you know of anything at all, if you can think of anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">(20 sec. pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah I guess the other thing is there\u2019s no rush to condo right? Just get the rental income. Because that will be more than enough, my mom should be fine. When I get back I can, I mean that\u2019s not gonna go anywhere. I can just do that whenever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: When you condo you were gonna move down anyway temporarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: If you are gonna leave the country otherwise that<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: It buys you a little time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. We could rent it out, and my mom is good about squirreling away money. So she could hopefully do that, and hopefully if I saved a little bit. And then by that time who knows. I mean maybe I come back with a job here or whatever. You know, who knows.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20094-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20094-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561582\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: Umm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: Or, I end up in a way by default it ends up what I wanted all along, which is I go condo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Umm hmm, umm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m there a few months, I\u2019m here a few months, I\u2019m there a few months, you know.

It\u2019s a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s is when you leave the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">CLIENT: Oh yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">THERAPIST: For more than a week or two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. But I don\u2019t know it\u2019s exciting. I mean I have been wanted to get, it is insane that I have never been there. That\u2019s that\u2019s getting to be just absurd now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah it\u2019s absurd, it\u2019s absolutely absurd. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">CLIENT: Everyone and their grandmother has been there. People like care way less, Vito, they are just going because they can, or whatever. They just go. So yeah it\u2019s at this point. (pause) And you know who knows it might even be good for. I think it would definitely be good for the writing, for sure. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">But even for the music, you know? I would be a very exotic, unusual kind there. And not necessarily money wise, but that\u2019s you need to start some kind of fan base somewhere that\u2019s a real fan base. It would also be easy to leave Assyria and play. It\u2019s a one hour flight to Istanbul. It\u2019s a one hour flight <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">to you know. So there\u2019s that too, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: And all those places are places where people give a shit when you\u2019re an American musician, they pay attention. If you\u2019re any good then it\u2019s even more. So I don\u2019t know it just might be good overall. (pause) Yeah and her thing is in one of her e-mails she was like you could teach in the Spring <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD1\">if you wanted, and I was like that seems, that scares me. That seems a little, very abrupt or something, you know? I don\u2019t stuff like that anymore, you know? I feel like I\u2019d rather, I don\u2019t know. That seems a bit I have got a band, I don\u2019t know it just seems a little too, I\u2019ll see you later. This I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD2\">mean I have got things that are important here, you know? So. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Your mother about this, and how you even think she.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah it sucks, yeah I know. I don\u2019t know what would happen with that. I guess it\u2019s different now right? People Skype and things. Do you do that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: I have, yeah. I have never done it like multiple times a week, and then when people once a week want therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah I guess maybe we could do like once a week or something, yeah. Because I know that that\u2019s when I have Skyped the few times that I have, it is kind of amazing. I don\u2019t know what you thought about it, but it\u2019s an oddly intimate experience. I don\u2019t know. I was surprised at the way it made <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200B51\">me feel. I thought it was just gonna be a phone call and getting to see their face, or whatever, and whatever. But it wasn\u2019t there was something kind of oddly intimate about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny I have actually only been Skyped with the Skype body, without the video.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Oh really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: No I mean the<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, which I would be open to video also. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: No the video is amazingly, what\u2019s the word? There\u2019s immediacy to it that\u2019s kind of crazy. Because I just thought it was gonna be a phone call with oh cool there you are, but it wasn\u2019t. There\u2019s something oddly very connecting. It\u2019s really weird. But yeah, no I mean it definitely changes. Even <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C11\">if it is once a week by Skype. That would be, I mean I would want that. But yeah it changes things you know. But all my good friends here, whatever. But you see that\u2019s the thing I think I have realized here. I need to stop. In a way that holds me back. Because it\u2019s like a safety blanket. You know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C12\">I mean? It cannot be that way. You have to do what you gotta do, and your friends they\u2019re not going anywhere, and airplanes exist. It\u2019s like you know. I have always had this weird thing that you go and that\u2019s it. You know what I\u2019m saying? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561582\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C3\">CLIENT: And a lot of that has been about money. I cannot just come and go when I want. But in this case it wouldn\u2019t be that way. You know what I mean? They be rental. If I needed too my mom would be able to send me a few hundred bucks or, you know what I mean? There would be a little flexibility, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C31\">I\u2019d be making money that probably I could. It won\u2019t be like London where I taught for almost nothing. And you know that was not. This is an actual teaching position, where if it\u2019s paid like here, as far as I know even nice apartments there are like $600 bucks or whatever. So I\u2019ll get a semi-nice apartment <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C32\">for $450 or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s much lower. The cost of living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. The whole thing there is that if you wanted to spend a lot of money of course you could. Because if you go out every single night, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in that, then of course you are gonna blow money. But it\u2019s Assyria, I mean cheese, bread, you know what I mean? That stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C71\">is super cheap. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C9\">CLIENT: And I\u2019m good with that. I get into a zone when I\u2019m not around. You know like in London I pretty much ate the same thing like every day, and you know whatever. And then I\u2019d just need beer money. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m not gonna buy a cup of coffee and enjoy myself while I\u2019m there. But I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200C91\">need to go to clubs, I don\u2019t need to have big dinners, I don\u2019t need. So I think in that way, from what I\u2019ve heard you can totally live very well. Because the kind of bars you are gonna go to are not going to be super high end. And once in a while you go, fine. But it\u2019s not you know. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB\">CLIENT: You know the thing is now I\u2019m realizing I really do know not just people there, but I know important people. There\u2019s a woman here, used to work at Yale. Very nice lady, she\u2019s French-Assyrian. She runs like a big non-profit thing in Assyria now. So there is her. This other friend, so there are <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB1\">people you know, so I think it is a little about just saying guys I\u2019m coming, so let\u2019s figure something out. I think there is plenty to actually do. It\u2019s just about being there. But there is no way in Hell I\u2019m just gonna. There has to be something to start off with. I\u2019m not just gonna show up and wing <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CB2\">it. That\u2019s not, you know.  (1 min. pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD\"> CLIENT: I think the key with all this is. I\u2019m definitely; I have been sleeping kind of weird. I have been I don\u2019t like it to be, as you know I don\u2019t like it to be warm, so I turn the heat kind of way down, but my comforter is so fucking hot. So there\u2019s times when I\u2019m waking up kind of sweaty. I\u2019ve <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">noticed like almost every night I have this weird, it\u2019s like then in the morning I\u2019m like did I wake up? Or did I half dream something? What happened? I\u2019ll have these weird things. Like I\u2019ll wake up like kind of not feeling good or something or being sweaty, or I don\u2019t know what. I don\u2019t know if the <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD2\">cat wakes me up or. But yeah it\u2019s like that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know what that, or I\u2019m just literally too hot then under the I don\u2019t know what the fuck it is. But I think just in general I think I just. It\u2019s about dealing with this new place I\u2019m in where it\u2019s just. I feel a lot better, but it\u2019s not very stable. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD3\">I mean the day-to-day logistics aren\u2019t. Now it\u2019s like an artist\u2019s existence now.

Trying to figure out a job. Like things are like a little more, you know? Which is great. It\u2019s more liberating, but it\u2019s for someone who has had such a history of anxiety and stuff it\u2019s a little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

You know<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Umm hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF\">CLIENT: And that is great, but it does also mean. Excuse me. It also means more time with yourself. More time in your mind, all this stuff. You know? Not having that, even though it\u2019s a fake security, but still it\u2019s a sense, you know. I go to work at 9. I come home at 5. Every two weeks I get an envelope <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200DF1\">with a check. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E1\">CLIENT: it might be a false sense of security but it is a sense of security, you know? So all these things. All the changes going on, even in my family. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like a very. It\u2019s a prolonged transitional period. You know? And a lot of it\u2019s good, but. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E3\">CLIENT: And you know maybe the other thing that would happen in Assyria, without being too optimistic or whatever. But because it does have a different social way of life.

I sure as hell cannot replicate that.

There\u2019s a, people just kind of there\u2019s more of that Mediterranean, or whatever European. All that stuff. And that there is more of a real Bohemian there that probably won\u2019t be there forever. But for right now, there are actual real Bohemians <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E71\">there. I don\u2019t know. Somehow maybe they\u2019ll. I\u2019m not too hopeful, but I wonder if maybe there might be more a little bit more feeling like I belong somewhere. I also know what Assyrians from Assyria are like, and they\u2019re not. They are also really fucking annoying. But I think there are enough people <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200E72\">like me who are there. People come and go, there\u2019s just a lot of activity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200E9\">CLIENT: So I think you find your. That\u2019s what I have heard at least. You find your group, and it\u2019s awesome. That\u2019s, you don\u2019t have to associate with everyone in Assyria. It\u2019s like here. You find like-minded people, you know? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200EB\">THERAPIST: And then maybe with that comfort feeling like we belong in our lives outside.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll go there and then I\u2019ll feel a little bit like the American outsider or whatever. But I have a feeling it will be more like how I felt in London <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200ED1\">or Europe. It\u2019s just, that\u2019s just the way it is over there. There\u2019s something, a different energy. It is a different kind of demeanor that people have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200EF\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200F1\">CLIENT: And that has its own problems, but I think that is what kind of works for me, so.

[inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FB\">THERAPIST: Perhaps.

So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200FF\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s what I mean, so maybe when you\u2019re in that place where you get to feel not so bad about yourself, you know what I mean? Like I fit in. I\u2019m part of the community, not an outsider. But when that part quiets down is actually when you get the work done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20101\">CLIENT: Right, right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20103\">THERAPIST: Where did you go when I was talking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20105\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I just spaced out. I think I was just thinking about London, yeah I was thinking about the feeling, you know? I think it is also the excitement of it. It\u2019s just like when they come here, I\u2019m sure they, you feel this crazy energy and you just feel reenergized and whatever you know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201051\">So there is that. You know so. But yeah it\u2019s the idea that you know you\u2019re in a place where you feel like there are other people like you doing creative things, and it\u2019s all good. It\u2019s all okay, and no one\u2019s you know. A lot of it is that there is no family. There is no, you\u2019re completely untethered, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201052\">you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">CLIENT: I have always said right, that\u2019s the problem with Darien. I love, people like me love it here, but then we\u2019re like we\u2019re from here. Like it\u2019s like we don\u2019t want to leave you know, but I think that\u2019s why you have to go and come back often. Because otherwise it\u2019s. You know there are memories everywhere. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201071\">It\u2019s something. Everything is so familiar. That\u2019s beautiful, but I think especially if you are an artistic person or an intellectual person you gotta shake that up and.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20109\">THERAPIST: You need it to get perspective on it too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Because no matter how much perspective you get, we\u2019re human. You come back and over time you lose that perspective again. You gotta keep recharging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Anyway going to their childhood home area, all the stuff comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20111\">CLIENT: And that feeling of because seeing familiar faces, and it\u2019s inevitable that you feel a little like what\u2019s changing really? Like this is it. I\u2019m here and this is it. Same people every year, year in, year out, same place. That can start having negative, instead of having that nice familial you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20113\">THERAPIST: It just stop being cozy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Because other people start looking stuck to you. At least to me it did. Oh wow, how many years have you been at that job? Like. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20117\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know I think it\u2019s pretty exciting the more I think about it. Because really what other opportunity am I gonna have to enact my plan? There are no job offers to teach in Berlin or, it\u2019s just not happening right now. They have their own soaring hot unemployment you know. This is an opportunity. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201171\">Especially when their department is brand new, and when I know people. And I have a book. You know like there are a lot of ingredients where I could go there and after a semester or two whatever, really start kind of making a place for myself, you know? Then you come and go. It\u2019s pretty simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20116-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20116-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561582\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">THERAPIST: [inaudible].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">CLIENT: Yes right, right right. Yeah, yeah. There is also the now I can see for sure what\u2019s it\u2019s like with Assyrian women. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D\">CLIENT: Like I\u2019ll then be like okay now I know. I\u2019ll either know that it\u2019s clearly me, I cannot seem to commit to it does not matter what they are. Or it could also be like, well you know what I\u2019m willing to deal with whatever downsides I thought there were with non-Assyrian. There\u2019s also a downside, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D1\">and this downside I don\u2019t like as much as. Yeah like there\u2019s also that, so. But at least I\u2019ll know. Like because I know myself. If I married someone here and got really, and got really. Then I went to Assyria. I know myself. Like you know I\u2019m so anti-regret, I\u2019d be like I\u2019m an idiot for not at least <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2011D2\">visiting here and just seeing what it\u2019s like to interact with you know. So I think that needs to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011F\">CLIENT: You know of course now the other thing is that, let\u2019s say it\u2019s all great. The pay is fine, whatever. It\u2019s gonna take money to get there. That\u2019s one. I mean I guess I could go I\u2019ll probably stay with people a little bit, you know. But it\u2019s still. It\u2019s an expense, so I gotta figure that out.

Did you leave it out there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20127\">CLIENT: I think I left it in the bathroom. What should I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20129\">THERAPIST: We\u2019re done in 3 or 4 minutes so you can go in a few minutes, or you can go get it now if you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012B\">CLIENT: Shouldn\u2019t I? I feel weird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012D\">THERAPIST: Up to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2012F\">CLIENT: Yeah let me go grab it. I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20131\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah I left it on the chair. This is the kind of shit I have been doing man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20135\">THERAPIST: Funny that just occurred to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20137\">CLIENT: That\u2019s how it\u2019s been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20139\">THERAPIST: Why, why right then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013B\">CLIENT: Well you know like you get into a thing like when you do things regularly. Like I have a habit. Like I\u2019ll be okay it\u2019s probably. I sense when it might be time that we\u2019re done, so I\u2019ll start like I won\u2019t leave my hat. I left it here once before, you know. It\u2019s kind of like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013D\">THERAPIST: [inaudible] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah yeah. I told you what happened with my phone right? Oh my god, oh my God. The other day I did a bunch of errands. I came home, I\u2019m talking to my Mom. I go to my back pocket no phone. I\u2019m like oh it\u2019s probably upstairs, no phone. I go to my car, no phone. Flipped out. I had just gotten this <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F1\">fucking phone, you know? So I\u2019m like oh my God, I left it at the store? I call them, they\u2019re looking for it, and they don\u2019t have it. I drive there in a mad rush. The guy comes out, we take the garbage out because I threw away some garbage, I somehow threw. A nightmare. I get all the way home, I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2013F2\">checked these fucking pockets, but I did not check the inside pocket.
