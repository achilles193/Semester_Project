Let me \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Oh, good, I just hang on to those things. Last time when I was filing taxes I was trying to see if I can do something with all of it, but I\u2019m hoping that maybe someday \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

So I kind of just hold on to those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: I have something that I\u2019ll give you as well, which I\u2019ve been meaning to give.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(34 second pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">It was 3\/12 right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: 3\/12, yes.

That\u2019s my own little way (ph) of just kind of keeping track of that.

I seem to recall enjoying our conversation last week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">We were talking about my little trip through my old neighborhood and what that was like. The experience of it. Some of the memories and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Kind of reflecting on my reaction to it and my surprise to my reaction to it and what not. I don\u2019t really recall where we left off with it. Maybe that was all we really talked about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: One thing that \u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just trying to recall if there was any more concluding point to the conversation or not. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Well, the thing that I think I said was I started talking about that movie, \u201cMud.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: That\u2019s right. I went home and I watched the trailer for it actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Did you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yes, I did. It looks like a really good movie. The trailer looks like, with the exception of Matthew McConaughey being both your description of him and the trailer, nothing else seems to be similar to it. It seems like a thriller, like an action thriller. Yes, that\u2019s where we finished. That\u2019s right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s interesting. It seems like more of an action thriller.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: I mean the preview of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:03:54) I guess there were, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I would definitely like to see it, though. The trailer said it was Matthew McConaughey\u2019s best performance of his career (inaudible at 00:04:04). Don\u2019t know if he\u2019s (ph) saying too much, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d seems very (ph) good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yes, fair enough. Fair enough. (inaudible) memorable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: You were talking about the distinctions of what I was getting at, or what I kind of was talking about that story, \u201cMud\u201d, and how I thought it kind of applied in certain ways to what \u2014 well, I brought up the whole idea of divorce and what it means (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: I remember it was right as time was running out, but I kind of said something along the lines of that strikes me as a little different than the way that I was thinking about it. I guess I didn\u2019t immediately identify with the character; the boy who is trying to reconcile his wishes, perhaps his <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">ideas about his parents being in love and together, and his family being together and then the reality. I guess I didn\u2019t see myself as \u201cthat kid\u201d who is trying to connive and get his parents back together or something. That just is never the way I viewed it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559933\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">I was never upset. The way that I (seem to have) (ph) made sense (of it) (ph), but I wasn\u2019t upset. Hell, I was happy with how good it was feeling. Those are just the actions of someone who was experiencing something very different than what I seemed to have kind of remembered or thought at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: It did make me think about what my point was about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: I remember what I said was about that, yes, the dynamic of trying to make sense of those two things, the fantasy and the reality, which being real tense friction between the two, obviously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess why maybe it brought \u201cMud\u201d to mind to me is \u2014 and I think this is maybe what I meant with the whole divorce is traumatic for the child, and these notions about love and things like that is \u2014 I\u2019m not even trying to be traumatic about it, I think it\u2019s (inaudible). But I think what struck <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200591\">me about your going down that road, I mean that kind of metaphorically but also literally, was you got in contact with these memories of a family together, of a mother with you, racing with you. What was it on the \u2014 ? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yes, she was running. I was biking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Your dad in the front lawn. And then how, when you were describing it, it shifted. You shifted to these reminiscences of your mother being on the outside of things; a very different mother from the one that was chasing you down the road. A very different mother. There was just a different feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: They were from different categories of memories. Different, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: And it seemed to me like it was getting at some of your feelings about that home and what that home represented to you. As you were saying, it was the red house that was associated with this time of your family being together. It just rubbed (ph) me as very important. And something about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">what was that life (ph) for you in the \u2026 that reminded me of that boy who really saw something important in the family being together under the same roof. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">In fact a lot of it, actually, now that I remember it, is about this house that they (ph) want to keep, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yes, the fact that that\u2019s an important and big thing to a kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: And not just abstractly. But then you got really in contact with that somehow. Those reminiscences. In your own \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: What was weird to me, and I think I said this last week \u2014 one of the things that really stuck out to me (at the time) (ph), and also at the moment, and also even thinking back on it \u2014was not so much this feeling like, \u201cOh, my God, my parents split up. This is horrible.\u201d But some of those memories <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200691\">that were just memories of happy experiences. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yes! Yes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: And I remember what was weird to me right at the moment; the fact that they were happy experiences but they were very uncomfortable. Almost uncomfortable in the way that I would expect, but seemed to have never even really felt so directly. Like experiences with my family splitting up. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">I even said to you that I felt less able to make sense of that. I was more comfortable with these unsettling things.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559933\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">That struck me as really odd. I\u2019ve thought about that. That really stuck with me. Why was that so shocking? Why was that so hot (ph)? Why was that such an experience? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">(9 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">I guess I would speculate \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe this is reaching too far or something \u2014 but I think that remembering some of those things and really enjoying it and remembering them as really happy, as things that I really liked or something. To use a phrase we\u2019ve used here, doesn\u2019t really fit into <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">the narrative. Like to the extent that I loved when my family was together seems to challenge the notion that it was totally cool. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Yes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: They seem to be vying for the same space or something to the extent that I would have explored that and really thought about it, reminisced on it and felt nostalgic for it. Now there\u2019s this tension between \u2014 I guess like what that kid was doing, which for me felt like something that I never <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200771\">embodied and never should embody. That just (would be) (ph) like an area that I could see all my friends in, that I just wanted to\u2026 If I could stay out of there then my whole family would stay out of there or something. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Yes, I was thinking that me bringing up the idea of this \u201cMud\u201d movie actually is kind of in some ways like, \u201cThat boy went through that, but I did not.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Right. I feel like going through it, even though I felt like I never identified with that, I felt like that was never me. In a way I feel like that was always in mind (ph). That\u2019s a very archetypal image of the little boy going through divorce like, \u201cI want my parents to get back together. Why <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">can\u2019t we be a family again? Is it my fault? Is this because of me?\u201d Those are all things that never\u2026 It seemed really important to me in hindsight, looking back on it I suppose, that I stay far away from those things. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">I don\u2019t know. I guess this last week I thought about it a little bit. Like why would it be uncomfortable for me to think about enjoyable times with my mom and my dad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">I used to have this one picture of my mom and my dad and me, when I was really young, when I was still crawling on my dad\u2019s back and stuff. And it was my mom, my dad, and me all doing a pyramid on each other laughing, like real happy, awesome family. I literally don\u2019t even have a memory of it, I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F1\">so young. I remember no instances of that type of interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">And I remember, I think someone\u2026 Somehow it came into my possession, maybe when I was moving it was in a box or something, I couldn\u2019t keep it in the house. I could not have it near me. I think I threw it out or something. I didn\u2019t even want to give it back to my mom because I felt like it was a bad thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: A bad thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Does that make sense? That I\u2019d do that (ph)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Yes. I\u2019m thinking about how there are these windows into more of that feeling around you. I was thinking about your father crying and then (it would go away) (ph). You caught (ph) him crying that day. That something important was happening and then not to be referred to again, or it was almost <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">like a \u201cdid that really happen\u201d quality, although you know it happened.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20086-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20086-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559933\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">And your mother. Seeing your mother on the sidelines at the soccer game or on the outs at this Halloween situation. Not to say that that necessarily had to do with something going on, but a different kind of \u2014 something your mother was feeling about. Some sadness she was in contact with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: I can remember one time when I was \u2014 it was right during the time when my parents split up, actually \u2014 I was dating this girl named Carlie, from high school. Maybe it was after my dad moved out, or maybe it was before. Regardless, he wasn\u2019t around, and it was before we were driving so she got <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">dropped off at my house before I got there one day. I was coming back from somewhere else, so she was hanging out with my mom for a little bit. And my mom always used to like these home videos that she made. She really loved that, actually, now that I think about it. She really held on to them. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B2\">still has them all. But in the same way I don\u2019t like looking at the photo albums or anything, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve ever watched them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">But I remember one time I came home and Carlie had been hanging out with my mom and she said my mom was watching these home videos from when we were in the old house \u2014 really young. There was a scene where my dad had the camera or something and started filming my mom and\u2026 This is even weird for me to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D1\">say. It feels uncomfortable even saying it. He\u2019s saying something like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s my beautiful wife,\u201d or something. You know, like I do with Laney probably, a hundred times a day. But Carlie said she glanced at my mom, maybe because she felt awkward at that moment or something, and she said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D2\">she thought my mom looked super sad or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">I remember Carlie told me that and she wanted to talk about it. I think she wanted to report that to me so I could go console my mom or something, like \u201cYou just got home. Your mom is sad. You should go talk to her,\u201d or something. But \u2014 (11 second pause) \u2014 I definitely didn\u2019t entertain that at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">(9 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">I don\u2019t know.

I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Are you feeling just kind of surprised by it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: I feel like I\u2019m bouncing around or something. I feel like I\u2019m trying to talk about things that I\u2019m more comfortable talking about or something. When I\u2019m talking about this stuff, I feel really comfortable for some reason. I feel like I\u2019m in territory that I\u2019m familiar with, talking about my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F1\">mom being really upset. It makes me upset that that\u2019s a place I\u2019ve...I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: You were just at that point, just a moment ago before that, talking about the feeling you had when you said your dad was saying these things. That didn\u2019t (inaudible phrase at 00:21:42).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: (13 second pause) Because that\u2019s the same thing. It feels different from talking about me thinking about maybe missing some of that stuff, too. That\u2019s a lot harder for me to think about. I\u2019m very comfortable with the idea that my parents split up and it was really hard for me because I had to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">see how hard it was for my mom. It was hard for her. It was hard for me, indirectly. Kind of as a result of seeing...do you know what I mean? But, that has no direct association with me and that experience. But thinking about that stuff seems to feel different in that sense. Maybe those things were <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A32\">upsetting for me, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559933\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">(8 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yes, when you even said the words that your dad was saying on the tape, it had some personal kind of resonance. It wasn\u2019t just about your mom. It was, but it wasn\u2019t just about her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">CLIENT: When I think about my mom being upset, I just think about her alone in the house. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">It gets back to the fact how last week I was just really surprised that I felt like all of my memories of us in that house were wrapped up in a little bubble. I feel like my mom got divorced from a relationship that I just wasn\u2019t even a part...she got divorced from my dad but that wasn\u2019t even my...I <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">wasn\u2019t even in that. I literally just watched my mom as if I was watching a good friend of mine break up with a girlfriend. I never felt like I was implicated. I wasn\u2019t going through it. I don\u2019t even have any firm memories of that family that split up. That just seems so weird to me, going to that street. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">It\u2019s kind of like, \u201cWow.\u201d I never even think about any of this stuff. It\u2019s like my life began in that new house. I don\u2019t have memories before that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">I guess that\u2019s just what seemed kind of startling (ph) about going to that street. It was like, maybe I kind of miss this stuff. The tension quickly started to come about. It was very unsettling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Well, in some ways, the bubble is kind of a preserving kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: It\u2019s containing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s containing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: To say the least.

It sounded more like you were surprised that it was there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yes, I didn\u2019t even expect it. I feel like if anything at this point in my life I\u2019d be reasonably capable of being able to expect certain situations that are going to be... particularly in this, though. That\u2019s just why I just felt like this is out of the ordinary or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">(20 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">I didn\u2019t even tell my parents. I didn\u2019t even want to talk about it. I just feel like if I mention to my mom that I went down that street it just would \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it would do, but it just seemed very clear in my mind that there\u2019s no reason to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I hear it both as it seems like it\u2019s one part not wanting to have your mother get in contact with some sadness, but it also means that it preserves that. It also means that you don\u2019t go into it, either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what seemed to get rattled (ph) a little bit. The view that sees it as me being upset about it because I had to see how upset my mother was. You know, in theory that wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest that if I went down that street it would be particularly difficult for me in the way that it was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Yes, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s kind of inconsistent the notion that these are not things that weren\u2019t (ph) difficult for me personally, purely because I had to witness my mom suffer so much. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559933\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200C7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just like the picture.

I looked like I was having a lot of fun. My mom was young and happy, and that makes me uncomfortable. I know that. I can tell that it\u2019s different from what I\u2019m used to sort of surrounding myself with in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200CD1\">terms of images (ph) of my family and stuff, but I only subtly speculate that maybe I miss that. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not even confident that maybe I miss that. I don\u2019t know if I do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200CF\">It still seems like kind of a leap for me to think, \u201cOh man, maybe I\u2019m really sad that my parents aren\u2019t together anymore.\u201d You know, which is different from, \u201cOh it was a really traumatic experience of them splitting up.\u201d That\u2019s different from me being like, \u201cOh, I wish my parents were still together.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D1\">That\u2019s just weird. I feel like that\u2019s why I get uncomfortable with pictures like that. This makes me sad? Why am I sad? This makes me uncomfortable. Do I miss this? Do I want that? That\u2019s (ph) the only thing that seems to make sense about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m having the feeling of it\u2019s not quite sure what it is but it\u2019s more like some feeling that arises when you look at a photograph or you walk down an old street. It\u2019s something that\u2019s no longer bubbled in some way and something kind of creeps out of that experience and starts to touch you. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D31\">And I think in a way you\u2019re sort of going, what does all this mean? And wanting to kind of keep it. It starts to become unsettling in some ways so you keep it kind of hoarded off in (inaudible phrase at 00:31:51). It has to stay in that place of the familiar. And in some ways the familiar narrative <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200D32\">(ph), too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: It very quickly produced a tension that just felt way more uncomfortable than it felt before I started (thinking last week) (ph). So it makes sense to me. Keep it \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And I\u2019d say, too, is that it seems to me that what you\u2019re getting at is that it\u2019s not kind of clear what it is you might be feeling about it. It\u2019s not like you go, \u201cBoy, if I open that a box of tears are going to come my way or I\u2019m going to be in this (inaudible).\u201d It\u2019s not quite clear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: It\u2019s very (inaudible at 00:32:51).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: And maybe that is unsettling in and of itself, not knowing what the hell is in this thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ll say it, too, even here. Even me saying that to you. Even raising the question, I don\u2019t even really know what I feel about that, but I know I feel something really strongly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">When I just said that to you, I was really gauging your response because that feels\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: What were you doing? Tell me about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">CLIENT: That feels something I just would not want to say to people. I don\u2019t know how I feel about that.

As you get maybe a little bit more close to a feeling you kind of connected (ph) with all this stuff. That it opens up an <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200EF1\">area, a new space. An unknown space in some way. Including the idea of starting to write something new and how you feel when you start to do that. Unsure. What\u2019s this going to be like?

Is this sadness or something? I don\u2019t know. I guess to describe it, even asking that question I feel like I want to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200F11\">ask it quietly or something almost.

But even just that time when family was a fun place. When I\u2019d run onto that porch when my dad came home from work. For whatever reason, really engaging with the fact that maybe those were really happy times, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD2\">seems to just carry some implications that seem to forget (ph) I guess, (even if) (ph) I don\u2019t know what they are.

It just seems like it would be more difficult. I guess I just feel confused as to why those are <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF1\">uncomfortable things to think about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">(20 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">THERAPIST: I think maybe it opens up the possibility of it having happened to you, too, not just to your parents.

That my mom would have been happy beforehand is not controversy (ph), it\u2019s not new. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20104-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20104-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559933\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20107\">But something just seems very different about literally seeing me in the third person as like an actor in that or something.

In a way, one way to think about it could be the sense that I never wanted to make it more difficult for my parents. That very experience, that seems like new (inaudible at 00:43:27) to think about was the very thing that I felt like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010B1\">if I could not do the things like that kid in \u201cMud\u201d did, and like my parents did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D\">Because those things that that kid in \u201cMud\u201d did, that\u2019s what a kid does when he\u2019s really upset that his family is splitting up. But, I think I\u2019ve said this to you a while ago, I felt like as if the only thing I could do was to try to not add that to it or something. I honestly don\u2019t know what else I <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2010D1\">could have done in a situation like that; to not want to make it worse for people. Like, \u201cSo you guys are splitting up.

It\u2019s like a safe base (ph) off, back on to it. Do you know what I mean? But, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a radical interpretation of that. The only people whose experienced that is, significant to that is, my mother\u2019s.
