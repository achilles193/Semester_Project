So the 19th, 20th and 21st I\u2019ll be out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I have logistical stuff actually for this week because the guys at Christian\u2019s, their mom died yesterday, so tomorrow and Friday are family stuff. We\u2019re going to go to their house, a wake, a funeral the next day. They\u2019re right around our times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So for sure we should take them off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Yes. I can\u2019t not go. Sorry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry. Gosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I mean she was old, you know? But it just sucks. But do you know what\u2019s really weird? Two things are really weird. One, she almost died the exact same day as her husband \u2013 literally hours apart. The other really weird thing is when their dad died that was then the summer I went to London and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">now I\u2019m going to Assyria. It\u2019s just weird. Not that I\u2019m reading anything into it, but just \u2013 you know \u2013 it\u2019s just funny how life kind of works. Things move on and change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Did you know her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I know you know them extremely well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Remember my dad died in their house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: In their house?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Yeah. We go way, way back. Way back. There are three couples. They have lots of friends, but their parents and then this other friend, their parents, there were like these three couples. At least once a week they were at each other\u2019s houses. So yeah, when I got older I wouldn\u2019t go with them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">all the time, but yeah, I knew them very, very well. She wasn\u2019t suffering or anything like that, but the last few years \u2013 this was the one I was saying is the opposite of my grandmother. She wanted to take medication, but she just sat there watching TV so her body just literally kind of \u2013 do you know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">what I mean?  (pause) So there is that, and then there are a few specific things I realized I have to deal with a little bit before I go. One is I\u2019m definitely getting nervous about going and there is a part of me that\u2019s not trying to talk me out of it, but playing devil\u2019s advocate about everything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200233\">Two, I think the bigger thing I need to let go of is I find myself being so unhealthily attached to familial stupid dynamics. Part of me is like if I go then my mom is going to be alone and these other fucking family people are going to eat her alive, as if she needs a protector.  That\u2019s just insane. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200234\">What is that? Because of the way she is I think it\u2019s, again, that pride and people taking advantage of you, which is only at the most very insignificantly true, if it is at all. I think I need to somehow let go because I don\u2019t want to have that. It\u2019s like I was saying last time, I don\u2019t want to be all <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200235\">angry at my uncle or aunt when they are kind of douchy. But you know what? No one is forcing my mom to do anything. It\u2019s just very simple. Let\u2019s say they are complete assholes.  Let\u2019s say my mom \u2013 she\u2019s not calling them. That\u2019s the problem. She can\u2019t pick a side. They bother her but they get along and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200236\">they hang out so then I\u2019m the one that looks like a weirdo if I get so angry. So it\u2019s like you can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t be complaining so much and then be with them all the time. I don\u2019t like that about myself. I\u2019ve got to really, truly separate or do away with whatever these sensitivities <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200237\">are that I have because she\u2019s really done a number. I\u2019m like yeah, my mom is old. What the fuck? She didn\u2019t get to enjoy her retirement. It\u2019s like well, what were you going to enjoy anyway? Were you going to go on cruises every year?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: And is she saying that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: Kind of. Yesterday she kind of was because I asked about my grandmother, which I shouldn\u2019t have done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: So she\u2019s saying she feels burned by them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yes. Now my aunt is here and she screwed up the whole system because those ladies were coming and taking care of my grandmother and now the whole system is like fucked up. Basically she\u2019s saying my aunt is a freeloader kind of. She\u2019s like she\u2019s not taking proper care of grandma. She\u2019s not really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B1\">cooking, cleaning. She\u2019s just here. I don\u2019t know whatever is going on in Portsmouth. All this stuff so that they constantly want to come to my mom\u2019s and hang out because, obviously, my aunt is going insane. I don\u2019t know how anyone could live. So I was just like, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have asked <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B2\">about my grandmother. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear these things because no one is forcing you to do anything. You\u2019re making it sound like they are storming the gates and they\u2019re going to knock your fucking door down.  Don\u2019t answer your phone. If you don\u2019t have the balls to just tell them, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B3\">don\u2019t answer your phone. Leave the house. Buy a ticket and go to San Francisco for two months. You have all this family there. But you won\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Or just say that it\u2019s time to put her in a nursing home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: She is being more vocal about that. Supposedly my uncle is now kind of looking. There is an Assyrian nursing home. That\u2019s still their thing. There has to be someone who knows Assyrian, as if that fucking matters anymore. But fine. My mom is definitely being more vocal now, but this can\u2019t continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">like this. The thing is, so is my aunt. What I was saying to my mom is you have to understand she\u2019s fucked up, too. Clearly she\u2019s kind of homeless. Something is really wrong with her situation. She either can\u2019t live with her daughter anymore \u2013 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there, but something is not good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: But no one knows what it is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Not really. We know that they have no money and stuff like that, but I don\u2019t know why she can\u2019t just crash with her daughter and just make do \u2013 like why can\u2019t she suck it up?  We\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on with that. Her daughter started a business and customers come to the apartment. That <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">could be part of it. And my uncle, I think he\u2019s put his foot down. What\u2019s he supposed to do now, also take care of my aunt and pay rent for her? I totally understand. Come on. He\u2019s already given her son a job. He\u2019s doing all this stuff for my grandmother. It\u2019s a bit much. So it\u2019s like this very bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200332\">situation. Regardless, I don\u2019t care. You are three grown-ass adults. Deal with it. And if it is such a burden, no one is forcing you to do shit.  If I was to go and go off on my uncle, he\u2019s just going to be annoyed and be like \u201cno one is telling her to do anything. I\u2019ve told her if you\u2019re tired or if <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200333\">you\u2019re . . . \u201cSo it\u2019s just complaining. \u201cI worked all my life. I thought I\u2019d be able to relax a little bit after all those years of working.\u201d You know what? First of all, that\u2019s complaining. Everyone works their whole lives. Anyway, what I\u2019m trying to say is I have to let go of this feeling that I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200334\">going to go away to Assyria and my mom is just going to be eaten alive here by these Piranhas and she can\u2019t fend for herself. Well, tough. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I\u2019m a sensitive person and I can\u2019t waste my energy being sensitive for bullshit.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: Even when you\u2019re defending her she\u2019s still not [happy.] (ph?) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah. I told her, \u201cI\u2019ve said this stuff a million times to you, so obviously you\u2019re doing this to yourself. I told you to go to San Francisco I told you to just not answer the phone. Don\u2019t answer the door. Tell them that you just can\u2019t for one week . . . \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: Tell them just for three more weeks. That\u2019s it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s it. Yeah. And you won\u2019t do it. So if you won\u2019t do it, then you\u2019ve got to shut the hell up or at least don\u2019t tell me about it. Vent to your girlfriends or whatever who, by the way, are telling you what I\u2019m telling you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s actually protecting herself from herself. She\u2019s been letting them do it to herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah, of course. Is my aunt going to be a little annoyed or get her panties in a bunch? Of course she is. Who gives a shit? Who cares? She\u2019s going to get over it. She isn\u2019t going insane anyway with my grandmother. It\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t know what the situation is, so just suck it up or shut <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">the fuck up. One or the other. But again, regardless, what I\u2019m saying though is she\u2019s never going to stop complaining.  That\u2019s what these people do. I need to be able to \u2013 which I have been doing a really good job of; but now that I\u2019m leaving, suddenly this thing got triggered that I\u2019m not going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">be here. She\u2019s going to be alone. It\u2019s her way of thinking that somehow she\u2019s going to be bullied. Whatever. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m thinking. It\u2019s just irrational kinds of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: It makes me wonder if you identify with her in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. In some ways, of course I do because I also do understand. I\u2019m angry anyway, right? My uncle is, I think, being a douche about this whole situation. I think my aunt is kind of selfish. She doesn\u2019t mean to be. I love her, but I think she\u2019s just so fucked up from years of isolated <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200431\">Portsmouth living with no friends and a fucked-up husband, so it\u2019s like on the one hand I have compassion for them.  On the other hand, it does annoy me that as many issues as my mom has, she sees this situation pretty clearly. She\u2019s having trouble with her own dysfunction and dealing with it, but she <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200432\">sees it very clear-eyed. That does annoy me a little bit that they\u2019re not more \u2013 maybe my uncle more than my aunt. This is my oldest sibling. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not fair because that\u2019s what my mom would do. Not everyone is the exact way you want them to be. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s being an asshole. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200433\">He\u2019s got his own life and his own stresses. He could be sitting around saying, \u201cI\u2019m all alone. I wish I had a brother. I have these two older sisters who are like moms, basically.\u201d He could be saying that. \u201cThey just baby me and they just act crazy.\u201d  Who knows? So I don\u2019t want to get sucked into something <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200434\">that only makes me feel bad and makes me look bad. It unnecessarily causes tension with me and either my uncle or whatever when there just doesn\u2019t need to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re trying to make sure that you don\u2019t get sucked into it. There is also trying to figure out why it sucks you in so much. Do you know what I mean? Who the Piranhas were when you were a kid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">CLIENT: You\u2019ve got to remember this was programmed. There were many years when I was little where there were issues. There was feuding going on and my parents then would argue about that, and when you\u2019re sensitive and way mature for your age they don\u2019t realize that you\u2019re picking up on all that shit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: The phrase you used a couple of times is \u201ceat her alive.\u201d Is that something you remember feeling as a kid? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Well, no, but there was just a sense of people being bullied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: [Your parents?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Kind of ganged up on and this and that. My aunt, the one that passed away, was clearly the favorite. That\u2019s just unfortunate. If I had just been one of my other cousins, that would have gone way over my head. I would just be playing and who gives a shit? But I would just pick up on these weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F1\">cues and get all sensitive and I\u2019d be stewing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: And protective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah. Protective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Feeling [you were getting hurt by these people.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Because as many issues as I have with my mom, they were in the right with those things. Some of these people were douchy. Now it happens in families. If I had just ignored it, eventually everything was fine. Things got cleared up.  People realized their mistakes and this and that, but it\u2019s too <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200571\">late. Once you\u2019re a kid and that\u2019s all hard-wired into you because you don\u2019t know. Then when you\u2019re an only child and you already feel shy and isolated all these things conflated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: They got pulled into politics?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Honestly I\u2019m not sure. There would just be conversations and my aunt\u2019s husband and my grandfather would kind of be on one side. Whether they meant it or not, they would kind of needle my mom and my dad. Yeah, it is kind of politics-cultured a little bit because my dad, because of my uncle, we <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">come from a very \u2013 these things are very difficult to explain in little snippets.  There is basically like a very important Assyrian political party that really is the only one. There were three, but this one is really the one. It\u2019s the important one. When Assyria was a country for all those years, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">this party was really what kept the diaspora really alive. My uncle, the pope, whatever, on that side there are two Vaticans, one in whatever and then the one for the rest of whatever. So that one is very closely affiliated with this because that kept things going. My dad wasn\u2019t a member. Nobody in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B3\">my family was a member of that, but incredibly sympathetic. It\u2019s like we\u2019re honorary members because of my uncle. My mom, for whatever reason, took that up. She feels very protective of that and that\u2019s her thing. These other guys, my aunt\u2019s husband came from the other side. That\u2019s fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: They were against each other then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: There were a lot of violent \u2013 my uncle dying young and all of that \u2013 a lot of the nasty stuff that happened was because of this other side. My uncle wasn\u2019t part of that, but he was part of that side. Then my grandfather was just wishy-washy. He has so much anger. One minute he\u2019d be like a communist <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">and the next minute he loved Reagan. So there was a period where they talked politics and eventually it would kind of get to this opposition thing and sometimes they would say one too many whatever whatever and then that\u2019s it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yelling? What would it look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: My mom would actually get more worked up than my dad. My dad is more like me. He will try as hard as possible. He\u2019ll be joking and say nothing. I don\u2019t remember them yelling, but I do know I\u2019m like that. You don\u2019t want to see me if that last button gets pushed. It\u2019s one of those types of anger <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200631\">where the record will scratch and everybody just stops; whereas my mom very quickly would get combative. My grandfather was the type that he would just get up and yell. He just couldn\u2019t walk home, just really some fucking angry \u2013 he just had a lot of anger.  So you can imagine for a number of years <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200632\">these kinds of weird things \u2013 so silly and completely pointless. But if you\u2019re a kid and you\u2019re sensitive to all that then \u2013 you know. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: Was it ever frightening?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: No, but I remember being sad and angry. The thing is, I was very close. I wanted to be with everybody so it just made me angry that this was happening. On the one hand, I\u2019d yell at my mom because I would want them to just let it go. But on the other hand, I would totally understand and I\u2019d be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200671\">pissed. Way too much for a kid to be concerned about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s the other part of the story that quietly hums as you\u2019re talking about it that is not bundled up into your construction of the scene.  It\u2019s that you were not, therefore, protected from this amount of anger and confrontation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: they didn\u2019t know enough to know that I was sensitive to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Actually, kids are sensitive to parents yelling, when they are yelling at each other and fighting. It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re having a banter that gets a little heated over the dinner table about politics. This is at a level much higher than that. This is the kind of thing that actually would <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">have been better, not just for you because you\u2019re a sensitive kid, but for kids who are sponges for this kind of thing and also get overwhelmed very easily with things they don\u2019t understand yet, so you\u2019re being flooded with big feelings being expressed that you don\u2019t know what to do with. What should <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D2\">have happened is they should have said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this later. There are kids around.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: Right. Neither of them had that. It just wasn\u2019t their way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: Again that they\u2019re not thinking about your minds. They\u2019re not stepping outside their minds or the urgency to have the fight and say, \u201cWe need to table this. Arto is in the room.\u201d So what happens is you become unnecessarily prematurely preoccupied with your parents\u2019 minds, with protecting <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">them, things that should not have been cares of yours. They should have been handling this behind closed doors. You\u2019ve become preoccupied with it and I think this is what you\u2019re saying you\u2019re carrying through to this day that makes it even hard to separate and go off and have your life right now. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">still so worried about protecting them because you were overburdened with this from way too young an age.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20073\">CLIENT: Yep. (long pause)  It\u2019s probably because I\u2019m the oldest grandchild and all that, but among my cousins it\u2019s also why I\u2019m the most sensitive. They\u2019re oblivious to all that. If I express it to them sometimes they get it, but I think a lot of times because they avoided all that. Their parents had <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200731\">other issues \u2013 a loveless marriage, this, that \u2013 so they have other things, but this level of always being sensitive to injustices, they don\u2019t feel that as much, not quite as much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20075\">THERAPIST: Were they around when these fights would happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">CLIENT: Sometimes they were, but they were just younger. They were oblivious. They were too young to notice, which was the other thing. If I had had other cousins I could talk to about it that would have also been different. You know \u2013 like \u201cfucking, stupid adults.\u201d But I didn\u2019t have that. And the one <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200771\">closest to my age, he had such ADD and he just didn\u2019t get it. He didn\u2019t understand. He just didn\u2019t give a shit, which was healthy. It was kind of great, but I couldn\u2019t be like that.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">THERAPIST: Is part of this playing devil\u2019s advocate?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: There is a lot. That\u2019s not a big part of it because I know it\u2019s so irrational. I think the bigger part of it is that I\u2019m worried that . . . Well, that\u2019s also irrational. It\u2019s superficial, part of it. It\u2019s like I want to go there and I\u2019m at a very important age in my life. I want to go there <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B1\">and I\u2019m not going to meet the kind of girls I\u2019m really attracted to. Generally, I like fair-skinned, lighter-haired \u2013 and that\u2019s rare in Assyria.  Beautiful. That can be absolutely beautiful, but I don\u2019t even like thinking it. That\u2019s kind of an irrational, weird thought. It\u2019s like I\u2019m going to squander <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B2\">opportunities here by going there instead of thinking there are going to be a shitload of opportunities there and lots of interesting people. There are Europeans that come in. There are all kinds of things going on, not to mention I\u2019m not going to prison. I can come here. Just this idea that I\u2019m going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B3\">there is weird. It\u2019s a weird feeling, but that\u2019s been one thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Is there someone in particular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">CLIENT: Not really, but lately I\u2019ve had one of these runs where there are like six women who are interested in me. That\u2019s part of it, I think.  I\u2019m not in love with any of them, but just even physically or the way they are, I just worry that it is going to be different. What I have here is my total <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F1\">American that I connect to these women. There, I guess I have an Assyrian connection, but their dialect is kind of different. How am I going to really express myself like this, unless they know English pretty well? And even then it\u2019s not a cultural . . . I don\u2019t know. I just worry, but I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F2\">why that is on my mind that much. I\u2019m going for a great opportunity.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it isn\u2019t really feeling the fear of being alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Maybe. Maybe it\u2019s just the nervousness that everything is going to be different and I\u2019ve got to get used to a whole new fucking thing again. (pause) In some ways, I think it\u2019s just normal nerves. I just feel nervous.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20085\">THERAPIST: This came up in a dream about Cecelia, how much was going to be new.

Reserved?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B\">CLIENT: Because they gave me a couple of dates, I\u2019m trying to figure all this out in like a three to four week period. I\u2019m trying to figure out which one would be best. I\u2019m not doing anything yet that\u2019s backing away, I\u2019m just very aware that there is a part of me that feels nervous. I\u2019m going to give <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2008B1\">up a lot of comforts. I\u2019m going to have a new routine, so I have to balance and remind myself that you have a routine (laughs) but you have no income and there is a reason you wanted to go.  That\u2019s a very good reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s actually a reason that facilitates your having a relationship [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2008F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I was telling myself, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20091\">THERAPIST: If you stay here and felt stuck and without an income, I don\u2019t think . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20093\">CLIENT: I would just keep doing the same thing, like juggling these women that I\u2019m not really committing to. Just nonsense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20095\">THERAPIST: Like the idea of taking a forward step \u2013 where are you going to live? You\u2019ve said so many times \u201cI need to get more of a foundation to have that and let the relationship be the next step\u201d and that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re doing to get there, whether it\u2019s back here or there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20097\">CLIENT: And I do remind myself of that. I\u2019m kind of forgetting that if they go as planned, which they seem like they will because I keep confirming different things, then it\u2019s going to be great.  And again, if worse comes to worse, I\u2019m just going to come back after a semester of teaching. Luckily I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200971\">aware that it\u2019s some irrational nervousness something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20099\">THERAPIST: Does it relate to here in this at all? Like how [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:33). Are we going to be talking or not going to be talking, how often are we talking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: Not on some conscious level. I haven\u2019t thought about it. I think it\u2019s more triggering some of my worst moments in London when I felt so alone and kind of disoriented. Combining that with I\u2019m so comfy here with my friends and all this.  But again, that\u2019s when I have to stop myself. It\u2019s not London, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">first of all. Second of all, I\u2019ll have an income. Third of all, I know people there. Fourth of all, it\u2019s not London. It\u2019s probably going to be pretty fucking amazing. Now I might eventually get sick of it. There might be things that really annoy me at some point, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B2\">be a lot of awesome-ness, too. Friends that I know and I\u2019m going to meet a lot of people. Whatever that nervousness or that devil\u2019s advocate is, I\u2019m able to see it for what it is, kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: The nervousness then is very specifically about being alone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Alone. Yeah, just alone, worried. What if I go and it\u2019s not what I thought it was going to be? I\u2019m kind of back at square one. But these are all kind of extreme scenarios, so it\u2019s like there is no reason to quite get so black or white. It\u2019s a place like any other. There are going to be some <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">really amazing days and other days where it\u2019s kind of bland and I am alone on that day; but that happens here, too. It\u2019s just that here it\u2019s so second nature. I can go two days with going nothing but staying home and going to the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2009E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A1\">THERAPIST: And in a way, that is not feeling alone.

Everything is like so second nature. I\u2019m very lucky that way. I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200A31\">that\u2019s a great feeling, but there is no way in hell you can let that stop you from trying something or doing something to advance yourself. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A5\">THERAPIST: And you get to bring Cecelia with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200A7\">CLIENT: Exactly.

Forget the word happy. I can\u2019t just chill and be excited that I\u2019m going to a new place. Like who cares. If my mom was saying these things, that\u2019s what I would say. Why are you getting . . ? Just go. You don\u2019t like it, you can come back. Enjoy it. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B72\">going to meet people. It\u2019s going to be really fun.  That\u2019s something. They\u2019ve done such a number on me that I can\u2019t. It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting there, but it\u2019s just really, really hard \u2013 books, music, but anything. There is this void. It\u2019s like calm down. Something is going to go wrong. It\u2019s never as great <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200B73\">as you think it is.

It\u2019s a little bit more of what I was saying about my other Assyrian friends. With a lot of them I notice that they use humor.  Sometimes they\u2019ll be talking in Assyrian about something or other and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cWell, our parents are like that. They were just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD2\">na\u00efve. They just worked like dogs. They didn\u2019t give us any guidance.\u201d But they\u2019ll say it in a kind of half-jokey way, then they just kind of move on. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I feel that now very often throughout the day where something will just pop up and I think what that is, is being your <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD3\">own person and realizing that that is fucked up \u2013 my uncle or my mom or this or that, my grandma \u2013 but that\u2019s just not me. That has nothing to do with me. And that\u2019s kind of liberating. You\u2019re right, it lightens things.  You can contemplate it. You can kind of get bummed about it or whatever, but it <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200CD4\">doesn\u2019t consume you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200CF\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s very different than thinking about it and then getting triggered into thinking that it\u2019s you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D1\">CLIENT: No, it doesn\u2019t. My days aren\u2019t thrown off \u2013 even yesterday. Yesterday was a little unusual. I did get a [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:25), these things I get. I went upstairs. I cranked up the Netflix. I had a sandwich. I forgot about it, so that\u2019s really, really important. (pause) It\u2019s that stupid <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D11\">saying that all you can do is control your own reactions to things. It\u2019s like stopping yourself and not letting yourself get sucked into something that has nothing to do with you.  It\u2019s a waste of energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Even the self-doubting about going could have nothing to do with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That\u2019s why it\u2019s felt good to be like, \u201cAll right. I\u2019m going. I\u2019m pushing myself to do this even if I\u2019m still incredibly nervous the day I leave.\u201d It\u2019s just got to happen. There are too many rationally good reasons (laughs) to allow for nervousness or any old voices to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N200D51\">get in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D7\">THERAPIST: It just sounds like it\u2019s going to be good, Arto. I don\u2019t mean great. Even if you go and you decide it\u2019s not for you after a semester, that that will have been worth it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N200D6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200D6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562542\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200D9\">CLIENT: Absolutely. There is no question that it will be worth it because I have a feeling that even if I decide I don\u2019t want to stay there for a semester, these things tend to open other doors, other things start happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Or even what it does about opening your own sense of what now you don\u2019t like about that, your orientation and relationship to the United States, to Darien.
