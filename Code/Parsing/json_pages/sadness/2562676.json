Do you, by any chance, have any flexibility on Tuesday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, perhaps. Yeah. What time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Let me take a look. Um... the 24th... Yeah, on Tuesday, I\u2019m just wondering, just for next week, if it would be possible to re-schedule. On Tuesday, I could do something in the... midto late morning, in there, around 11:15. Would that be a possibility?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: I have to (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: What time do you have to be at school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I will leave at 10:30 or... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: And so you, are you there till...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: 5:00. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re there till 5:00.

Because I could certainly do something... like, right around lunch... time like, around... just (inaudible)... um... like... around... like, 12:10? (client affirms) Would you be able to do that, so we\u2019d do Wednesday and Thursday, rather than Monday and Wednesday? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">(client affirms) Is that good? Okay. So then, I\u2019ll put you in next Thursday at 12:10? (client affirms) Do you want me to e-mail that to you, too? (client affirms) Okay, I\u2019ll do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I would, I would confirm it, just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Okay.

Okay, great! <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Snow makes it... difficult to walk, because it takes longer. (chuckles) (therapist affirms) (pause) Monday was kind of a disappointing session, or maybe I was just in a weird place. (chuckles) Because when I... I, you know, got home and just like... panicked or whatever, spent most of the day <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">just crying. (chuckles) (therapist responds) I had to... I don\u2019t know. I have a deadline coming up, all of a sudden it... I had to submit the whole draft of my novel to be able to do this workshop and... the deadline is coming soon, so I was trying to see okay, what more can I do in the next ten days. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">So I thought I\u2019d print the whole thing out and like, just that thought, you know like, just is freaking me out. (pause) And I guess just the conversation of like... building versus destroying. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. I mean, these are, that\u2019s such a dichotomy, I don\u2019t know. I wish I could... look at <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D3\">things differently, I guess. I don\u2019t know. Because those are so stark, you know, opposites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">(pause 00:06:50 to 00:07:29)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">My professor was like, \u201cI just don\u2019t know about these workshops are, that you\u2019re taking so many workshops. The idea is to develop your inner critic and...\u201d (chuckles) I was just like, \u201cYeah, okay. I don\u2019t know.\u201d (chuckles) I\u2019m doing it for a very good reason. But you know just like, him saying that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">very quickly, felt really, having all of the facts or... I just kind of still, you know... made me fearful. (pause) Yeah, I think I (chuckles) next several months are meant to be spent... like, it was a lot of fear. So, I don\u2019t know. I guess I should plan for it, I should...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Fear about what? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Well, just you know like... the next phase of editing, and revising, and you know, contacting, you know, editors, or agents or whatever, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20034-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20034-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562676\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">(pause 00:08:40 to 00:09:10)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">I mean, there is just so much uncertainty in things that I\u2019m doing. And... like... I guess I just want to be able to... (sighs) have like, a strong core that is able to deal with that uncertainty, you know? (therapist responds) I don\u2019t know like, I would just like to find my own answers, I think; just <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">not... going to come from anywhere else, you know. They\u2019re not going to come from Chris (ph), they\u2019re not going to come from Nelson (ph), you know? (therapist responds)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I\u2019d like for them to come from my mom (chuckles), you know just like, someone over everything, but... I don\u2019t think... that, you know, I think you\u2019ve pointed that out, maybe? That that\u2019s just like an idea in my head, that other people have this awesome structure that guides them and all, that lifts <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">them up. It probably doesn\u2019t. So... Yeah... (pause) I mean, I don\u2019t know. I feel like maybe I look for trouble, too, to some extent. Whatever... Or, I don\u2019t know... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">Like yesterday, Chris was talking about his colleague\u2019s wife, who was also... you know, was like, that she was in the same field and she was trying to get a job. She didn\u2019t end up getting the job at BC, because her... She\u2019s really the same, the same is true, whatever, you know. Chris was like, \u201cYeah, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">she\u2019s probably going to get paid more than her husband.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, how nice for her.\u201d He was like, \u201cProbably $90,000, like...\u201d (chuckles) You know, I\u2019m just like, \u201cI would really like, you know...\u201d You know, nine times, ten times, you know, which I made, (inaudible) because I made (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">(inaudible). I was like, \u201cWhat am I doing with my life?\u201d You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">It\u2019s not really like, you know... all I can see like, you know, she\u2019s sweet and breezy and, you know, that she will have this. But you know, I have to remind myself, just think about like, all the struggles she must have put herself through to get there, you know? (chuckles) (pause) I don\u2019t know. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">feel like... what am I looking for? Am I looking for that kind of stability? I don\u2019t think so. I should like, be very clear with myself. I\u2019m just maybe lying to myself, or I\u2019ve not been clear with myself that that\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for right now. I had it and I gave it up, you know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just like... weird to me that I act a certain way, when it\u2019s like... Like, I need to have a conversation (chuckles) with myself, where I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing!\u201d You know, why am I... getting off target, you know? Or like, with Nelson and you know like... He\u2019s in town <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">this week and so... (sighs) I had tea with my mom, and I was just like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just wait for dinner. Maybe I\u2019ll have dinner with him.\u201d Well, I never did have dinner with him. (chuckles) I don\u2019t know. Well, I guess I have, but... so I was, you know, expecting something, some text or whatever, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">nothing came until after dinnertime. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">He was just like, \u201cHey...\u201d You know. And then he was like... \u201cCome over.\u201d Then I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d So he was like, \u201cI\u2019m having dinner with my roommate.\u201d (chuckles) Just like... And I felt a bit weird about that, but then I was like... I\u2019m not in that situation, you know. I\u2019m not living with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">him, you know. It\u2019s not like... me and Chris, where we talked about everything, and had all our meals together, you know. It\u2019s not like that. (chuckles) (therapist responds) We\u2019re not in that domesticated situation, where I\u2019m going to cook. And I walked out of it, so why am I... weirded out when... <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">I don\u2019t have it with this other guy, you know? Then I have this habit of trying to like... checking his texts. If his phone is lying around and like, he\u2019s meeting his ex-girlfriend, and they\u2019re going to have dinner later this week, and... And I was like... \u201cSo! You know, you\u2019re friends with Chris, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">know.\u201d So why does that weird me out, you know? It\u2019s just like I... consistently look for trouble. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20042-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20042-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562676\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: So you, what are you looking at his texts for? What are you looking to find?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: Well, it just... I guess I\u2019m trying to get entertained, I don\u2019t know. Like, I know he\u2019s texting one of his, they\u2019re in touch, so I\u2019m just, you know, seeing what conversation they\u2019re having. (chuckles) So... (pause) I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking to find. I guess I\u2019m looking... like, catch him, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">you know. (chuckles) But it\u2019s like, I\u2019m doing the same thing, so... (pause) It was almost like, then... I randomly think, \u201cOh, Chris would never do this...\u201d (chuckles) Other things like... yeah, but he might. It\u2019s not like I was completely... happy with him, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">(pause 00:16:05 to 00:16:44)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">It\u2019s like I have to actively remind myself not to like, think or over-think or expect too much from anything or anyone, you know. I feel like that\u2019s my natural mode like, I just want to... go... like, all the way or whatever, you know like... be in that domesticated situation, and be exclusive and not, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">try and never talk to Chris, if that\u2019s possible, you know like (chuckles)... But I feel like that\u2019s just not... what I should do, you know. So I kind of... forced myself into this halfway point, like in this halfway zone. So... Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">It\u2019s like, things being incomplete and inconclusive. Because I wonder if that\u2019s like, the natural state of things (inaudible), you know? And just being happy with... in that, in that state, when things are unfinished and incomplete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">(pause 00:18:09 to 00:18:44)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">Well, I also want to have some control, you know like... sometimes I feel like, in this state, I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m, you know, as much in control, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: \u201cIn this state,\u201d this state being...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Like, in the state of incompleteness and like, halfway point, the halfway zone. (therapist responds) (pause) Because I feel like, you know, people are not ready or I\u2019m not, you know, ready either, so... you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">(pause 00:19:25 to 00:19:44)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">It\u2019s very much the metaphor (ph) of my writing as well, you know like... It\u2019s in the process, it\u2019s... that I should live and learn, I think. It\u2019s not ready, so I have to remain in that state for a very long time (therapist responds), until it gets ready, so... But it can be very taxing, you know? Just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200591\">like... but I mean, I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, that I don\u2019t feel as much in control, because like, if something is behind you, it\u2019s decisive, you know? It\u2019s like, you can look at it better, you have a better view, or idea, or whatever. So you feel like you have more control, but... I don\u2019t know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200592\">maybe other people think differently or, even when they are doing something, they don\u2019t feel as... out of control as I do. (chuckles) I certainly do feel that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562676\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, even if a situation is out of your hands, you can feel in control of yourself. And I think sometimes you struggle to feel in control of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I try to say that I should separate the situation from myself or...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Maybe. I wasn\u2019t sort of actively thinking about that. (client affirms) I guess it made me, I was think , because I was going to ask you, and I want to ask you more about what you thought was so upsetting when we were talking, more about what was so upsetting about Monday\u2019s session. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">I was thinking about this issue of being, you know, constructive versus destructive, and being in a destructive mode. There is sort of an out of control part of that (client affirms), feeling out of control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I do want to talk about constructive\/destructive, because it\u2019s such a dichotomy and it really depresses me. (chuckles) So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: The dichotomy does, or...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, just thinking that I\u2019m like, in a destructive phase, you know. (therapist responds) Yeah, we need to go over that. Like, that really makes me feel out of control. Like, \u201cOh, you know, it\u2019s like, totally what am I doing? You know, everything is destructive!\u201d (chuckles) But it\u2019s like, if <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">I pause and think about it, I feel that way only because, you know like, moving out from Chris\u2019s place has me, has put like, a great financial strain on me right now. So... that\u2019s why I feel like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m destroying my, you know, savings,\u201d you know? Or, you know, spending a little more than I really, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200652\">but... (pause) I\u2019m borrowing money, which, you know, is not... the best idea, but it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not permanent, so... And I can put a stop to it by finding, you know, a job, as soon as I feel I\u2019m ready for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">But I don\u2019t know, I just feel like... thinking of Chris and his place and his like, open invitation to move back and stuff. That\u2019s feels like such a... stable thing, you know? Like, I gravitate towards that, obviously, because I feel weird, I feel ungrounded financially, and even emotionally. But I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200671\">then, when I\u2019m on my own and like, feeling positive, I gravitate towards the... like, to Nelson, or you know like... the excitement and the unpredictability. So... (pause) I guess, I don\u2019t know if that, if this... dating between one and the other constantly is like, a sign of being out of control (inaudible). <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200672\">I mean, both are impulsive, so... I guess it depends on which impulse I\u2019m feeling at what time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">THERAPIST: Can you say more about how upset you were on Monday?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">CLIENT: Um... yeah. I don\u2019t know. I guess, I mean, it was a weird weekend. I didn\u2019t do much work. I wanted to, but I went shopping with Nelson instead like, both days. I did some work Sunday night, but not enough. I don\u2019t know, it was just a, I\u2019m just at a weird point. I\u2019m supposed to write (inaudible) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B1\">in the last chapter, and I was like, looking at it and freaking out, and feeling like, you know, years and years\u2019 worth of work is nothing, you know? (pause) Yeah. Awkward sentences, standing for the hopelessness of the whole project (chuckles) and I\u2019m looking at them, freaking out. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2006A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562676\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">And then, I mean, I guess the thing with the session... I can\u2019t think... I guess what you said like, about... I don\u2019t know, I think I had said... like, I didn\u2019t have the financial foundation or the emotional foundation to do this or do that. And then you said, you know, \u201cThat means you should have even <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D1\">more planning,\u201d you know? So I was like, you know, \u201cYeah, in an ideal world.\u201d (chuckles) I guess I got a little defensive there with myself, or for myself. And then, just the whole conversation about, or just me thinking of getting a degree that I already have, and what am I doing. That just kind of, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D2\">and like, I have to go to school the next day, which I really didn\u2019t want to do, so that just... Like, everyone around me seems very stable. Chris, Nelson, but then again, as per our earlier conversation, I seek these people out (chuckles), you know. Because I feel like I don\u2019t have stability, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D3\">because I seek. But I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">But there are those people who don\u2019t have stability. Like, I think of... I mean, all of my classmates, you know. They\u2019re, most of them are now younger than me. (chuckles) (inaudible) probably they are, most part, or you know, it\u2019s like in their 30\u2019s, but... If I think about my classmates, I know that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">they\u2019re not as stable as I... have the idea in my head. (pause) Where was I going with that? Yeah, and I mean like, you know just, I felt really weird, very insecure about what I was doing, and wasting money and... and not being on top of things, and not being an even better planner, as you said. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">know like, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the foundation, you need to be even better at planning.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay,\u201d (chuckles), I guess I didn\u2019t do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">So I felt like a failure, you know. And then the daunting task of printing just freaked me out (chuckles). I was crying and then I was, I skyped with Chris, you know. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing!\u201d He was like, \u201cDo this!\u201d And I couldn\u2019t do it. (chuckles) So... Then I went to the print shop <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200711\">and was printing one page at a time. It was costing him like, $1 each time. I\u2019m like, okay, let\u2019s stop. You know, let me get a handle on this. (chuckles) So the next day, he printed the rest. So... I mean, I know that... so that little lesson was like, you plan and then you execute, even in a small <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200712\">thing as like, printing a document, you know. But... you have to acknowledge the anxiety of the task, you know. You have to take care of that, get over it somehow, and then... you can plan. So... I just am waiting to get over a lot of anxieties, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: So it sounds like some of the things we talked about on Monday, rather than feeling like, \u201cOh, okay, well, maybe I could do this,\u201d it just leads you to despair. (client affirms) Look at all the things I can\u2019t do, that I\u2019m not doing, or I didn\u2019t do. It just sort of heaps (client affirms) on itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I feel that way constantly. I mean, there were little pockets earlier, where I didn\u2019t feel that way. (pause) And what is destruction, anyways? Like, is... partying on Friday nights destructive? (pause) I don\u2019t know. Because you have a hangover the next day or like, you can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200751\">start working at 7:00, but you have to wait until 12:00? Is that destructive? I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s a genuine question. (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562676\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20077\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. (client affirms) It depends on, I guess, what are you destroying, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. So 7:00... five hours of work, I guess... (pause) But it gives you this power, doesn\u2019t it? Like, doesn\u2019t that make you feel in control? I mean, it\u2019s ironic. It\u2019s paradoxical, but that\u2019s what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry. What gives you control?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">CLIENT: When you\u2019re destroying something, when you\u2019re being destructive. I feel in control, I feel very powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">THERAPIST: It certainly gives one the experience of a particular kind of power, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So confused. Where is the parameter (ph) we\u2019re talking about? (pause) So what, so, your question about like, the Monday session. Like, what...? What do I do with that information? (chuckles) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">THERAPIST: (pause) I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t follow the question about Monday\u2019s session.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I mean, the conclusion was, I mean, I, it made me despair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like that was part of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah. Should I talk more about that, or...? What should I talk about? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Where do you think the question is coming from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">CLIENT: Which question?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re asking me what you should talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: No, there is like, several threads, so now I\u2019m like... what do I do now? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">(pause 00:31:58 to 00:32:21)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">I mean... I see what you\u2019re saying. So you\u2019re saying like... you meant, on Monday like, the stuff you offered, you offered in the sense of help, as in like, \u201cHey, you could do this.\u201d But instead, it made me despair, right? (therapist affirms) Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s what... I don\u2019t know, isn\u2019t that what <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">depression is? Or, I don\u2019t know, not depression, it\u2019s something else, but... You know, things that are supposed to help you, somehow... seem... to come... like they\u2019re out to get you, you know? (therapist responds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">Like, I mean, there are all these positive examples. Like that woman who\u2019s going to make so much money now teaching, you know, is going to get her job. You know, that\u2019s a positive example. You know, something, you know, I should be happy for her and blah blah. But it makes me feel ridiculous! (chuckles) <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200971\">You know. And Chris and Nelson and their stabilities, their, I have started out to make, for whatever, you know, complex (inaudible). But it comes out to make me feel ridiculous, you know, because, yeah... because I compare. I will hear the help in that, you know, in your, you know, what you said on <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200972\">Monday. Maybe I hear judgment, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you do. I was thinking that. It sounds like you hear judgment. \u201cYou should have planned better!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) So, I mean, there is something that converts that positive into negative, right? I guess that\u2019s the piece we want to understand and disempower. (chuckles) So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well, with the... the planning piece. You know, what you were saying, I mean, what you\u2019re saying, ultimately like, sort of at its foundation is, you know, \u201cLook at all these things I don\u2019t have any control over.\u201d And I\u2019m sort of, my retort is, \u201cYou actually could control them, and that maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">it would be a better idea to take more control over them, given the situation. Like, it, maybe...\u201d And then there is a way in which you\u2019re like, that you convert that to... you know, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything right,\u201d or (client affirms) \u201cI\u2019ve messed up or ruined something.\u201d (client affirms) (pause) What, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D2\">at those moments, when I talk to you like that, I definitely am not talking a victim\u2019s narrative (chuckles) or helpless narrative. Like, \u201cOh, you could do something about that!\u201d And if you\u2019re in a place where you\u2019re feeling there is nothing I can do about that, I think sometimes it almost makes you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D3\">angry. It\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about this!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562676\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it was just abstract. If we had like, been more concrete I would have understood it better? Like... yeah. I guess I was thinking of all those nights, or months, that I spent (sighs) writing and not really getting anywhere, and by getting anywhere, it just means like, the New Yorker <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F1\">saying, \u201cYay, we love you! Come on board,\u201d you know. And not, you know, that I was slowly building up towards... something. You know, nothing is a waste. Far from it, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: So when you were crying, is it like... sadness or it is frustration? Because you were saying that you were crying lot on Monday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, just... it was just like, feeling really... scared and... what am I doing, just... yeah, just fear, you know. What\u2019s next, what\u2019s going to happen? You know. I\u2019m in like, a hole or a puddle, how do I dig myself out? Just feeling pain, you know. (pause) Will I find a job again? Will <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A31\">I have money again? You know. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well, with that sort of uncertainty, there is also the... The counterpoint is that there is a lot of power and control. You can do a lot of things. It\u2019s your choice. And it\u2019s almost like... you retreat from that. Like, actually, you could get a job, or not get a job. Or you could do this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A51\">you could... You actually have a lot of choice. And there is almost like, too much anxiety about having so much power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: (high-pitched surprise) What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t think? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: (laughs) Where is that? Where is the power? What are you seeing? What...? Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Well, the power in the choice. Nothing is being foisted upon you. You could take a lot of different directions, and it\u2019s up to you to decide which direction you\u2019re going to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: And it seems like that can be very overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: It is, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: In those moments, you just want to be told what to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: No!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: No? Well, maybe that\u2019s not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I remember when it used to be very true. Not so long ago, I wanted to be told what to do. (therapist responds) Yeah. That, you kept saying that. You just want to be told what to do in, you just want to be told... I remember. But I feel like, it\u2019s... I don\u2019t know, again, hard to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200BB1\">objective. But I feel like I\u2019ve outgrown that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BD\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200BF\">CLIENT: No, no, no!

Yeah, well, I feel like I have outgrown that phase of... wanting to be told... what to do.

I just choose to take it in that way, whether there is truth to it, that\u2019s how I take it. I don\u2019t know. Like, she\u2019s, like they\u2019re like... flirt, flirty, I guess? Actually, I really don\u2019t care. It\u2019s got nothing to do with me.
