So I got a letter yesterday asking me to consider being a Eucharistic visitor at my church? So that's somebody who goes around to people who can't make it to church and takes the Eucharist to them, talks to them and things...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Which I'm excited to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: It's nice to be asked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [I'm glad] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) (Chuckling) I don't know if it happens to you, but, when I dream in the early morning before I wake up, it's often more vivid, and I remember it more? [0:00:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: And it's harder for me to distinguish between dreaming and not dreaming? So I dreamed it was Thursday. (Chuckling) And then at one point I was in the shower and was like, shit. It's actually Wednesday, isn't it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh (laughing). So... (Pause) That was lots of fun. (Pause) I also dreamed weirdly that I was at Sephora looking for makeup, because I don't go to Sephora ever. I get my makeup from the drugstore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:02:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I've pretty much stopped wearing makeup in the last week. Mostly... I've had acne for the last six months. And it's just been a very frustrating thing for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I'm really self-conscious about it and all of that. And I think the makeup is making it worse, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) Are there other things in the dreams that you have associations to? (Pause) [0:02:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I don't think so, that I remember, not today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Like, Sephora as opposed to the drugstore, is that (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, the only time I went... I've been to Sephora, it wasn't actually Sephora. It was sort of something like that. I went with Candace a couple of times when we were in Charlotte, getting makeup for my wedding actually. I know it exists. I have, yeah, associations with it. But this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">was like... I was looking through the sale rack and trying to find something that matched my skin tone and kept finding things that almost did but not quite? It was one of those frustration dreams where...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Oh. Uh-huh. [0:03:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Where you don't actually ever find what you're looking for. But, unlike in real life, where you eventually give up, you keep thinking that it's got to be right there. (Pause) [0:05:00] Yeah, I have those a lot, looking for something or trying to do something or trying to find something (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">at 0:05:09) I haven't quite woken up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: It's weird talking to you about my physical appearance. And I can't tell whether that's because you're a man or whether that's because you're another person. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Hmm. (Pause) [0:06:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: When I was... I've tried to get away from the kind of bonding that involves tearing yourself down, tearing your appearance down? And so that's sort of just... and also, I mean, I don't have... I don't really have... I don't have close female friends here in Providence? So that sort of devolved <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">into, I just don't talk about the way I look with almost anybody? I sort of talk at James sometimes. [0:06:57] But he doesn't really have much to say. And I'm not actually looking for him to say very much. I'm just sort of talking. But... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559790\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">Yeah, I'm going through a period of really just not liking much about the way I look. And, I mean, I've got acne and don't like my hair. And I don't like most of my clothes, and etc, etc. So I just don't talk about it. (Pause) [0:08:00] Kind of like (pause) that feeling of when you look in the mirror <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">and getting ready to start the day, oh, this is probably about the best I can do. Oh well. It's not so bad. That's just... it's both... it feels pretty normal to me in terms of, most of my life that was a really good day (laughing). And so it feels like normal and also not so bad. [0:08:57] (Pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200412\">[0:10:00] And I feel like... (Pause) (Chuckling) I sort of feel like, well, it doesn't call me the active anguish that it did when I was a teenager. So I'm just not going to worry too much about it (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:11:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I miss having women friends. Or I have women friends, but I miss having women friends in the same city.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Living with Kirsten was... it was tough for my self-image because she is... the way she looks is sort of the way I always wanted to look and never possibly could?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Oh. Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: I'm about six inches too tall, for starters, and about 50 pounds too heavy. [0:12:03] And yeah, she's just beautiful in a very different way than me. And she just hates herself, and it's really heartbreaking. (Pause) But this is hard for me (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:12:57] But (pause) I was helping Amanda... or Amanda called me last week to... she was going to a family wedding, trying to decide what to wear. And so she sent me pictures of two dresses. And so it was a case where both of them were good dresses, both of them looked really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">good on her. Because of the way she felt about herself that day, neither of them were going to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: And I sort of said, I think this one looks great for these reasons, but I also understand that's not really what we're talking about. [0:13:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, I (inaudible at 0:14:07) that. (Pause) My friend Harriet Carter (sp?), she's coming into Providence for a conference next week, so I'm hoping we can get to... I really lost touch with her in the last year. [0:15:01] I mean, it's been a very hard year for her also, so we'll see how it goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: I don't want seeing me to be something that causes her stress. But, as I say that, I realize that's not really my job (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: I can say, and I have said, I don't want seeing me to cause you stress. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: To her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah, to her. [0:15:58] Conferences are busy and rough sometimes...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: So (inaudible at 0:16:03). But... (Pause) I don't... I can't really know what she's like now. But the way she was when we were friends, she's also not very good at taking her own needs into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I see. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: We were very similar in that way. [0:16:55] And then we kind of, yeah, went different places and in different ways. And I started to learn that that was a little messed up (chuckling). Yeah. (Pause) I miss her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, one of the things that nice about having more female friends around is the way that it kind of reassures you that they're likely to be struggling with some of the same things... [0:18:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559790\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: In a way that makes you feel less bad about the things you struggle with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) It makes me feel like (pause) hating the way I look and hating the clothes that I have and all of that is not... it helps me not trivialize it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I see. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: But... (Pause) [0:19:00] But at the same time it's also... it isn't just me. And so... (Pause) I feel like it helps me both not trivialize it and not attach undue importance to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) It sounds like it's different talking to me, a man, about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Hmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: I said it sounds like it is also different. You wondered initially...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Is it difficult because it's another person or it's a guy? And from what you said since then...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:19:57] Yeah, it's just like... (Pause) Sort of like not being able to assume a shared cultural context...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: In that it's not that I don't feel like you will understand or do understand. It's just that I imagine at least that it won't be something that is also a deep part of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I see. (Pause) [0:21:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think both James and Franco worry about their bodies also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: I know they do. It's just a little bit different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: And in some ways they have to explain it to me, I don't understand the way that they worry. I don't... (Pause) I'm not instantly familiar with it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Which I feel is a little bit... it's oversimplifying, because obviously not every woman experiences the same and all of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: But... (Pause) It's sort of sick, but that is one of the things that I have found to be remarkably similar among almost all the women I've ever met. [0:22:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: The ways that Kirsten worries about her body and about her clothes are so much the same as the ways that I worry about my body and about my clothes. And we look so different. And we were raised so differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Of course that's something you can only find out as an adult because when you're a child and a teenager you hate each other, because you think, oh, well, she has the body that I want. So she must not have any problems at all (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: And then eventually you realize, no, everybody gets screwed (chuckling). [0:22:56] Nobody wins. (Pause) That was one of the hard things about being raised by Papa (ph), was just that there was no way that he could understand that being clothed wasn't enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Right, having a shirt on your back wasn't enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: Yeah. In retrospect, I think he was just proud that we all made it out the door in clothes every day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: I can sort of say, yes, that is something you should be proud of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yes, that must have been really hard. [0:23:58] But... (Pause) And I was really tall for my age, pretty much always. And, until I hit puberty, I was very thin. But... so, I mean, looking at old pictures, I just wore massively too large clothes. I just wore adult hand-me-downs...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: For years and years and years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">THERAPIST: I see, that sort of fit you in terms of height but not at all in terms of your shape?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559790\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not even sure that they did fit me in terms of height.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: I think they were just way too big.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Way too big? [0:24:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: And yeah, I just cringe when I look at those pictures (chuckling), partly because I'm just like, oh, that's... I think mostly because I just... I look at the pictures, and I think about how unhappy I was. I don't like really looking at pictures of myself as a kid. (Pause) Most of... because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C51\">most pictures that you have everybody is smiling in some way or another. And I just... (Pause) Yeah, I just remember being so miserable. Facebook is the worst for that, because you can't take down other people's pictures of you (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah. [0:25:56] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: And you can't say... it just... it feels... it would feel churlish to say to my parents and... oh, by the way, all these pictures that you have happy memories of are incredibly painful reminders to me of a really miserable time in my life. [0:27:04] Yeah, I can't say that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: So for our toast at my wedding-there was a dinner-my dad read a story that I'd written in fifth grade. [I don't know if I've] (ph) told you that. And it was very clearly ripped off from a book that I was reading or that I'd read many times. And everybody thought this was the sweetest thing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD1\">first that he'd saved this from when I was in fifth grade, and then that he read it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: And it was this very lovely thing. And it was very sweet. And it was so painful for me to listen to. I just couldn't stand it. It was agonizing. [0:27:56] I was like, please stop, please stop, please stop. But they... he was trying to do this nice thing. And I never... so everyone was kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D11\">like, no, it's a great story. And the other week we were visiting [Cody and Kerry] (sp?), and this came up. And Cody was like, oh my God, that must have been awful. I was like, yes, it was awful (chuckling). It was like, finally, here's somebody who understands. And I think it's because you never... <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D12\">that writing never stops being what I did. I can't look at it as the story that a fifth grader wrote? It's the story that I wrote? And it's not something that I would be proud of today, and so it's not something I can be proud of? And so it was just... it was nice to have somebody just automatically get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:28:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: It was... I mean, it was funny to hear it again. I thought it was like a novel when I wrote it. And it was very short (laughing). (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: What was it about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: It was about dragons and a princess who didn't want to be a princess. (Pause) And the prince comes to slay the dragon and marry her. And she's like, screw that. She's like, no, I'm not going to let you mess with the dragon that is my best friend. So then they have a fight, and she wins. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200D91\">the prince is like, why would I want to marry you anymore? This sucks. And she's like, okay, fine, get off my back. And then he leaves, and everybody's happy. There's this book, Dealing with Dragons, that is pretty much exactly that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:31:00] (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's hard for me to talk about it. (Pause) [0:32:00] (Teary) It's something that my dad was so proud of, the, I guess, result of my reading all the time. But he did a lot of discouraging my reading all the time, not that I think he would... I think if I'd stopped reading, he would have <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD1\">encouraged me to read more. But it was always... it was just like, you can't read at the dinner table (chuckling).

You can't read when you're visiting other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Right, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) You can't go to parties and read. I don't know. (Pause) I feel like he was so proud of me being this (ph) kind of gifted with words and reading a lot and being creative and writing, and he thought (ph) that helped me. [0:34:03] The reading probably helped me. But in terms of (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E51\">at 0:34:18) none of it feeds me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Do you mean his being proud of it, or do you mean you're being good at it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: Both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Neither of them protected you at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:35:00] I guess more my being good at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: mm-hmm. (Pause) You're talking a lot today about (pause) the horror of how you see yourself and the ways that-I guess this was the dream partly-you're always looking to cover that up in some fashion and kind of compulsively...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Or without realizing it. [0:35:58] And in this incredibly frustrating way it doesn't work that well or for that long. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F5\">CLIENT: That makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F7\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I haven't stopped wearing makeup because I don't want to wear makeup. I've stopped wearing makeup because it seems to be making my acne worse, and it doesn't actually work very well to cover up (laughing). And it's really hard not to wear makeup. Hard to walk out the door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FB\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FD\">CLIENT: I wear mascara, but that's it. (Pause) [0:36:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200FF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that falls sort of pretty...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20101\">CLIENT: Neatly (sp) (chuckling)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20103\">THERAPIST: Neatly, in that it makes what you're already feeling so awful about worse and doesn't cover it up. And it's sort of terrifying to be without it at the same time. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah, it doesn't (ph). [0:37:57] I think, because this way of being or a way of thinking... because hating self basically is something that most if not all the women that I know share to a greater or lesser extent, I... (Pause) So I said before that being around other women helps me not to trivialize <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201051\">it or take it too seriously. But I think what I want... I think that it helps me not to trivialize or take too seriously the individual choices that I make and the kind of effects of it? [0:39:04] But it makes it harder to tell whether it's something I should actually be worried about or something that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201052\">I should actually pay attention to. The... not... with the... sorry (inaudible at 0:39:23). It makes it harder to tell whether the kind of horror of being myself (chuckling)... whether that is something that I should pay attention to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20107\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah, I think... (Pause) [0:39:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20109\">CLIENT: Sometimes I don't know what to do with people who don't hate themselves.

That seems pretty reductive when you put it that way. Not that what you're saying about me, but the kinds of things you're describing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) to other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:41:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think in a way clearly you don't feel like that. But I think it feels that way sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't want that for anybody else that I know. And so I... (Pause) Yeah, I try to cover it up. (Pause) [0:41:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: And the other sort of angle, which I think is the way things felt... as in junior high, I guess, and high school that you were describing, where the kind of hatred and interest in kind of crushing you or taking away what you have sort of isn't what you're doing to yourself. It's what other <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B1\">people want to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">THERAPIST: Like what you were saying about this kind of competitiveness, which I guess I understand was a pretty cutthroat competitiveness [that you felt] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah, all in the sense that it's like, I'm never really in the competition? [0:42:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20123\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20125\">CLIENT: So it's kind of like, did people want to stomp on me that day or not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: Yeah. In that case, the kind of crushing hatred wasn't coming from yourself but from them. And then later it seemed like, well, that's what people do to themselves actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I told myself. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: And (pause) I think that's... (Pause) [0:44:00] That's what makes it tough, I think, to talk to me about, is that, whether sort of in some fashion it comes from me or it comes from you, you're kind of in the room with the crushing hatred, if you're talking about how you look or how you feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B1\">about how you look or other things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: How do you mean? I'm sorry, I'm not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: You say it's difficult to talk about, or it makes you feel self-conscious. And it may be because I'm a person or because I'm a guy. I think... (Pause) [0:45:00] It makes it kind of difficult to talk about it because, from a variety of possible angles, it evokes that self-hatred or hatred.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: And you're really nervous about... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: Are you going to hate me for this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: I don't think you think I'm going to... well, there may be kind of (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: Or stomp on me (chuckling)? I'm sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">THERAPIST: No, that's okay (chuckling). Well, that you're going to feel incredibly self-hating as you're talking about it, and that will come to the surface. Or I will say, I don't... it's a little complex the way you anticipate I'm going to stomp on you. [0:45:55] I think you anticipate that I might <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B1\">say something that's very hurtful...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">THERAPIST: Intended therapeutically or in whatever way.
