(long pause)  So on Monday I left work around 3:00 because I wasn\u2019t really feeling very well. I was talking to Howard, the one who [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:19). He\u2019s like an MD PhD. He was like, \u201cOh, yeah. Something is going around.\u201d (both chuckle) <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">Fantastic. I went home and it kind of got worse. I started feeling better yesterday afternoon. I just kind of sat on the couch. It was kind of hard to do anything or pay attention to a movie or anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: You were feeling that bad then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. But it was all right. I got up around 6:00. I got really sick from maybe the spinach dip or whatever. I had pretty bad e coli my sophomore year and was out for like a week, so the whole time I was like, \u201cWell, at least it\u2019s not as bad.\u201d (both laugh) I kept thinking it was going to be over <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">any minute and it would all be better in an hour. It was all right. It wasn\u2019t too bad.  It\u2019s nice to be [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:01)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m glad it was no e coli outbreak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: (chuckling) Right. (long pause)  I\u2019m backed up at work, but I think I\u2019ll be fine. (long pause)  I guess I\u2019m just still feeling a little [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:50). I\u2019m not really looking forward to planning the next several days of work, but everything is fine. (long pause)  [I thought it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">really good when my mind was just kind of blank.] (ph?) I can just get back into routine and just being bored. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: By bored, you mean for having been sick and not being able to do anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Right; and I\u2019m just kind of tired of [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:44). Yesterday was the first sunny day in a long time and I kind of wanted to get outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s like the timing sucks? Yeah, it\u2019s sunny \u2013 blech.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, like I was kind of being kept in or something. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not the end of the world if it lasts that long, but I guess it was kind of a drag to be sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess it\u2019s always hard for me to accept it and relax. I guess the whole time I was just waiting for there to be a kind of relief.  I was worried about it being indulgent or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: There might have been an aspect like any other thing that holds you off of routine where you\u2019re pushing yourself harder or a little anxious to not be up and doing things the way you usually are or it\u2019s frustrating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: I guess. (pause)  I guess it was like hard to concentrate, so I was just worrying about how to catch up. I guess I was a bit dramatic because I was wondering if I did anything to . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Sorry \u2013 wait . . ? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: I was just thinking, \u201cHow does anyone get anything done or have enough energy?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You mean because you didn\u2019t?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Right. There is this thing where I feel like I should have pushed a little more, like maybe gotten outside. It\u2019s kind of the feeling of how does anyone get anything done and push themselves, because I felt like I was being a little indulgent or something or not wanting to do anything.  I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">it was just because I couldn\u2019t concentrate to watch anything or read or anything. I was just being bored. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562428\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: And the thought about \u201chow does anybody get anything done?\u201d was that it was so hard for you when you were feeling crummy to kind of push through that and accomplish something, that it was hard to imagine how other people could be pushing themselves to do things? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. (pause)  I think it was just because I kept getting e-mails from work and I just kind of had the feeling of . . . I don\u2019t know. (pause) I think it was just because I couldn\u2019t do anything. I was feeling like a lot of people are able to keep doing this or . . . I don\u2019t know. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\"> I don\u2019t know if it was because I wasn\u2019t accepting that I was sick or just wanting to do better. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: In a way, who would want to accept they\u2019re sick? You just have to lie around and not do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I guess other than that . . . (pause)  My brother texted me last night and I\u2019m always nervous or scared when he contacts me, but it was just [one of those things.] (ph?) He was just asking me if UNC looks like my final choice. That was it. I think I told you when I first <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">came here that he got a DUI a long time ago, almost two years ago.  He finally got the breathalyzer thing in his car taken out. I guess it\u2019s kind of like or he\u2019s done with his parole. That\u2019s nice. He\u2019s finally free, so I guess that\u2019s good. (long pause)  I guess I bring it up because my brother or my <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200352\">mom calls me it\u2019s always like I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to deal with. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: I guess one of these days you\u2019ll have to take care of them or come to their rescue in one way or another. That will be pretty demanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)  I guess I also feel fragile or something, kind of unable to help them, because I\u2019m overcome with not knowing what to do or not being able to kind of give relief or help or something. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not just like they\u2019re going to need help or if you do anything in a way that you\u2019re sort of up for but that it is potentially going to throw you as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)  I don\u2019t know if this is kind of like . . . I don\u2019t want to be burdened with something or feel like I\u2019m unsure or inadequate to help. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: In a way, it feels like what they need will kind of take you over in a way. Or you feel like they\u2019re making a big demand that you have to deal with, but maybe you can\u2019t and then you will feel frustrated with them or resentful for being difficult or not dealing with it themselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Right. [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:31) (long pause)  I mean with my mom it feels like I should work on the relationship or something, but talking to her for one, I have so much resentment and two, being around her infuriates me.  I feel like she\u2019s not trying or putting any effort into making any <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200411\">situation better or being a contributing person or something; but I\u2019m just supposed to put up with it and allow it to happen, even though it\u2019s just irritating [ ] (inaudible at 00:32:53)  (pause) [ ]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: As opposed to express your resentment in some fashion by pushing her away one way or another.

It\u2019s not like she ever has an answer or why. I think she was doing the best she could, but I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s a cop out or a lie. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: To be clear, I wasn\u2019t saying that I think this is what you should do. It\u2019s just like you sounded like you have two alternatives in mind and I guess I wanted to make sure that I was clear about what the other one was, although I get that the problem here is that neither one of them is any <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">good. Sitting there seething doesn\u2019t work and saying something to her doesn\u2019t work either. You\u2019re stuck with being infuriated and helpless either way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)  But in the end, I have no idea what I want as an outcome. I would rather just not deal with it. There is not something I want to strive for; I just don\u2019t want to deal with it.  (long pause)  In my mind there\u2019s no [feeling okay or being happy about this.] (ph?) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been frustrating that I haven\u2019t made any viable suggestions or had some other way to help you feel better about it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I kind of just blame her. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know if there is any solution [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:02).  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I guess it makes me think a little bit of you being sick, which I guess renders you similarly helpless and frustrated. In some ways, it\u2019s much easier because you know it\u2019s going to pass. I guess some of the feelings seem similar. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I guess \u2013 I mean, yeah. (pause) I don\u2019t know. I get angry. I don\u2019t know.  I guess at her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Why don\u2019t we stop for now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
