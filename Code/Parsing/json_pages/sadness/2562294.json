They clearly know who you are. They can find the prefixes and they have all this other redundant information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but they only do what they\u2019re supposed to do, which is to match the numbers exactly, because I had two accounts with them through Yale. and, I guess, maybe it\u2019s different people. But until I integrated the two in this long process, they didn\u2019t know what the other one was doing.  But <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">this is a little easier. Did you have a second thing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t remember [to record.] (ph?) That\u2019s the second thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: [Did you end up not remembering?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019ve been remembering, but I have to use the iPad. It was more to myself. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know how to say how I\u2019m feeling. (pause)  You know the observation about how the kid who can\u2019t contain or is too overwhelmed by how he or she is feeling sort of throws it back at the adult to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">see what they do? How sometimes I do that? I\u2019m feeling that way, but I don\u2019t want to give it to anyone or I can\u2019t or it\u2019s too much or it\u2019s too many different things. But I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want it inside me. I can\u2019t slow down enough to work with it \u2013 even like now, what the different things are. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\"> On the bus ride home on Friday \u2013 it\u2019s got to be perfect for me to get back to Waltham in time for a 5:30 yoga. I took an early bus and it turns out there was a ton of traffic and the bus driver was like \u201cthere\u2019s a ton of traffic. This is going to be a really long bus ride.\u201d A bunch of people got off. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\"> I got off without clear sense of what I was going to do instead. It was a classic hour of not really accepting the way things were and begrudgingly accepting that I would miss 5:30 yoga and wishing that things were different, trying lots of options like the subway, the other bus, the other kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200194\">bus, texting with Jeremy. It was a flurry of \u201cstop.\u201d  I realized that once I had committed to the other bus, the public bus, and committed to the 6:45 yoga class, there were all these uncertain things about the weekend. I need to tell people answers. \u201cYes, we\u2019re doing it.\u201d \u201cNo, we\u2019re not doing this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200195\">with you.\u201d Jeremy and I needed to talk about it and we hadn\u2019t finished talking about it, so I wanted a lot of answers from Jeremy in that time that I was waiting for the bus. Jeremy was like, \u201cI have to poop. Let\u2019s talk when you get home. I don\u2019t want to talk about this right now.\u201d I said, \u201cI guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200196\">that\u2019s okay.\u201d I realized I just don\u2019t want to be with myself right now. I want to be with this. I don\u2019t want to be here and I can\u2019t stand myself in this state.  And it feels really bad. It feels like I need to be constantly reaching out for something outside because what\u2019s happening inside, which is <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200197\">not that complicated \u2013 disappointment, impatience, frustration \u2013 I just didn\u2019t want it and didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I was looking for lots of stuff and then it was just like \u201cwell, it\u2019s time to make the bus.\u201d And it all settled down and went away when I realized I could just accept all this stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200198\">the bus traffic situation is bringing up as a part of me that is not too crazy about it.  I don\u2019t actually have to do anything about it. (pause) The things I can do can be for myself with myself; they don\u2019t have to involve Jeremy or taking the subway instead of the bus or checking all the different <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200199\">schedules to see which one is going to get me home faster. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20018-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20018-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562294\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">But if Jeremy had been available to talk, I probably would have tried to give it all to him and I didn\u2019t need to feel very unsettled. Instead, it felt like I had pressed restart. (pause) But I don\u2019t know how to do that now.  I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a restart button around. It would be really, really useful <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">if I were really excited about my PhD and wanted to work on it a lot because it\u2019s really, really big right now and it\u2019s really hard. I need to be the one, in various ways, to rule out paths and rule in paths and decide when I\u2019m done.  It\u2019s too big and I\u2019m feeling too much like I\u2019m walking through mud <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">and there are other big things like you and this and some lethargy or something. It feels like it\u2019s taking up the space that could be devoted to the PhD.  I don\u2019t really want to change around what the spaces look like. I think I just want to be more enthused, alive, calm, patient, accepting of the space <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B3\">that the PhD is taking up and not [getting there.] (ph?)  (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s not how you feel about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: Enthusiastic, alive, calm, accepting, patient? No, it\u2019s not.  (pause) I have in the past, and I feel very nostalgic for those times. It doesn\u2019t feel like some abstract thing; it feels like it\u2019s lost, something that I have is lost or I\u2019ve gained so much that it\u2019s not possible to have what I had <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">at a simpler time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">THERAPIST: I guess the parallel to me to what you were talking about before, like with the bus and the yoga class and stuff, was once you saw how things actually were, rather than wanting them to be a different way, you felt much better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">CLIENT: There was that and the other important acceptance was I want to give this part away to somebody. I do not want to stand by the way things are and it\u2019s causing all this stress.  Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Perhaps I\u2019m missing it, but it sounds kind of similar with not wanting how you are feeling, lethargic and other things, too, I guess. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a bit too much. It feels like I can\u2019t breathe. (pause)  I have two projects: One with the European with the bacterial culture machine and one with myself, the sequencing \u2013 relapse versus reinfection \u2013 and they\u2019re both really complicated and no one has done either one before. They could <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">both be what I\u2019m working on singularly; and I have my undergrad. It feels like the entirety of our senior thesis is being done today and in the next month.  Kelly is sort of being patient with me, but it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s actually being patient. She feels like she decided \u201cI have to be patient <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200272\">with [Allison]\u201d and that\u2019s how her actions and her tone are, so there is this uncomfortable push. If I could find a shiny stone and decide that I\u2019m done with this portion of the project or whatever it is, things would be easier between Kelly and me. I\u2019m dreaming like crazy and having these . . .  (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200273\">I\u2019m not going to do it justice because I don\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t remember them well when I woke up, but on Friday night I dreamt that . . . I feel like this is too much for you because I\u2019m talking. I feel like you\u2019re too slow or too \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 too slow to handle what\u2019s coming at you and you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200274\">not going to do it justice either, like me and the dream, and you\u2019re going to pick one thing and then it\u2019s going to feel disappointing to me, like I gave you too much.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20026-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20026-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562294\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">THERAPIST: It sort of reminds me of what you said the other day, wondering if I\u2019d rather have Jeremy as a patient. It feels, in a way I think, in part like you\u2019re overwhelming and you [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:16) and you throw too much at me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:43). (pause) I\u2019m glad that the thing that I said registered with you and that you brought it up because you didn\u2019t answer [at that time that there was anything else] (ph?) about it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it relates to that feeling, too, of not wanting what you\u2019re feeling or all that\u2019s going on for you and just wanting to get it away.  Then I imagine feeling like if you do, the other person won\u2019t like it either \u2013 like me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">CLIENT: If I do give it away to you? It is pretty intolerable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">THERAPIST: Sure. Wait . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">CLIENT: The stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">THERAPIST: The stuff. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:50)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I was thinking of your idea of giving it away.  In other words, I\u2019m not saying I think the stuff is intolerable; I\u2019m saying I can imagine that for you it feels quite intolerable to give it away. That\u2019s what I meant. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. It covers too many areas of life to try to give it away to one being or one person. That\u2019s how it feels. (pause)  The dreams are like in this lab [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:14) on top of a hill in this coastal town and we see people running towards us and there is a tidal wave or an ocean. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. There\u2019s just this rush of water and it\u2019s fast and it\u2019s loud and people are screaming and we have to react and I\u2019m watching, almost enthralled by it \u2013 like whoa. I have to scramble to get higher and higher and higher. It\u2019s not clear that there are any higher places <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B2\">to go.  There is a dream where Jeremy and I are going to have sex and Jeremy and I are going to have sex; and the other one is going to watch while I have sex with the other one. It was very, very, very exciting. They\u2019re each telling me what they were looking forward to; and I really, really wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B3\">both of them. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">Sometimes I sort of call you up in my mind at night before I go to sleep. For some reason, the word \u201ccooing\u201d is coming up. I don\u2019t do anything habitual in these times, but it\u2019s this general \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 like I coo to you. Maybe I might imagine us somewhere, but sometimes it\u2019s just like you are in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">the air.  There was a lot of that over the last couple of days \u2013 last night especially. Last night I dreamt that we were together in bed and we were just cooing to each other. (pause) And it wasn\u2019t wrong. I wasn\u2019t unfaithful; it wasn\u2019t bad. The bed was made. There wasn\u2019t any touching. I don\u2019t remember <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D2\">much else.  (long pause)  This pre-bed, night-time cooing feels very old. It feels like I\u2019ve been doing it since I had my first crush or something, like third or fourth grade. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562294\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Now that you mention it, I think I\u2019m a little out of sorts. I\u2019m probably not as available as usual. I\u2019m quite sure it\u2019s not to do with you and there are several things that are affecting me throughout the afternoon, but I don\u2019t feel way off or out of it \u2013 but a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Sure. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: I hope it gets to be okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20047\">THERAPIST: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">CLIENT: You\u2019re welcome. (pause) Today is mine and Jeremy\u2019s ninth anniversary together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Oh, wow. Congratulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">CLIENT: Thanks. (pause) I think it feels a little like ahh. We have a wedding anniversary now, but there is [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:41). There is also our third anniversary of his asking me to marry him.  Three years ago, Jeremy took a [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:04) \u2013 we lived in San Diego at that time <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">\u2013 at 6:00 AM and he had arranged for [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:16) meet me for lunch across the street from school. He had arranged for my entire office to not let me take on any time-sensitive experiment that day \u2013 for the rest of the week. I think it was a Thursday. Kelly included. Jeremy is a very <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D2\">shy person, but he was not shy about this. Everybody knew. He was sitting at this [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:57) that Betty and I had arranged to meet at and, of course, Betty wasn\u2019t there and Jeremy was there.  [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:05)[ ] (inaudible at 00:40:06) and he was there to be there for our <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D3\">anniversary, our sixth anniversary. After like two seconds I knew that there was something else going on, but I didn\u2019t let myself go down that road. He seemed very nervous. It was a bit of a bad story with this ring. I think we had decided that we wanted to get married. We had told our parents and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D4\">had expressed some interest in having a ring and I had also expressed some interest in having a piano instead, which I would still like to have. But the ring one, we had looked at rings once, but that was sort of it. That was the general bad story.  We then went back to my apartment and it was a beautiful <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D5\">day. It was very arm for February and I came back to the lab and it was like, \u201cKelly, Jeremy [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:23) anniversary.\u201d She was like, \u201cGreat. Great. Have fun.\u201d I really had that vibe. I got back to my apartment and started running around the apartment, jumping \u2013 which I do sometimes \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D6\">jumping, jumping, jumping on the bed. I could sense that there was something going on, so I just wanted to start a whole \u201cit\u2019s so beautiful; it\u2019s so great.\u201d Then Jeremy started jumping on the bed.  He said, \u201cAllison, will you marry me?\u201d I stopped and I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d I started to giggle and he said, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D7\">\u201cNo, Allison, it\u2019s real. Everybody knows.\u201d (both laugh) It was really sweet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s very sweet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: He had this fake costume ring. It was hideous and I did not want to wear it. And then he said, \u201cYou have to pack a bag because we\u2019re going to Bar Harbor and I\u2019ve arranged to borrow Darren\u2019s car. There is a bed and breakfast there and they\u2019re waiting for us because at 4:30 there are cucumber <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200511\">sandwiches or something he was really excited about. We got to Bar Harbor and stayed in a ridiculous place and had this ridiculous French dinner. We called a few people then and then called the 30 people that I told you about and the next day we came back.  He had gone to New Jersey to ask my parents\u2019 <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200512\">permission maybe a month before. And the last part is that he designed this ring using CAD 3-D design software that he had no idea how to use and he used [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:44) diamonds and worked with this artist, who also design his sister\u2019s ring, to basically get everything the way he wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200513\">it to be. The basic design was the guy\u2019s, and then Jeremy . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562294\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: You mean who worked with Tammy or do you mean he worked with his own sister?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: He worked with Tammy on her ring. That\u2019s how Jeremy knew about him. He\u2019s a designer. They picked something off the shelf and \u2013 he\u2019s an artist, so nothing he makes is ever the same as anything else he\u2019s made. But Jeremy brought him this 3-D model and this video [and sex] (ph?) and all of this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200551\">stuff.
