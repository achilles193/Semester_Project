So . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Oh, oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. That loan is not going to work, so I\u2019m fucked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: How come?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: With the formula that they have, we just wouldn\u2019t get \u2013 there\u2019s a cap. Reverse mortgages are FHA things. The FHA, in its fucking wisdom, doesn\u2019t give a shit what your house is worth beyond $625,000. Our house is worth like $800,000 or whatever it is. They automatically just say, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">matter. $625,000 is what your house is worth.\u201d  If that\u2019s the case and you have a mortgage of $250,000 or whatever, they\u2019re not going to give you all the rest of that, right? There\u2019s like a loan-to-value ratio. So really, after everything was said and done, there was going to be like $80,000. That\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">great if my mom \u2013 you know what? I was thinking about this and I\u2019m very lucky because my mom could. Other parents do. She could be like, \u201cYou know what, son, I\u2019ve got to do this for me. I\u2019m struggling,\u201d because it is great for her because once you\u2019re dead, who gives a fuck? She would have no more debt, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200153\">no more nothing. She would have that rental income that would go right to her and then I just deal with it once she died; so it\u2019s good for that, but if you have any plan to not lose your house . . .  I wouldn\u2019t lose the house if we did that, but I would definitely have to sell it. It\u2019s not awful, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200154\">it doesn\u2019t serve what we\u2019re trying to do. Also it would be a shitload of money. I knew there were a lot of fees; for reverse mortgages there are lots of fees. We\u2019re talking thousands and thousands of dollars, but in my mind I\u2019m thinking this is the price I\u2019ll pay for this bigger change. Yeah, we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200155\">fucked. I\u2019m kind of numb now. This wasn\u2019t going to change anything about this week, but on top of that, I have no doubt that this week I\u2019m going to have maybe three checks that are going to bounce. I\u2019m 90% certain just because I\u2019m doing the best I can trying to pay whatever I can, but this week I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200156\">it\u2019s all fucked.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Just not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So things are not good. Things are not good because I don\u2019t like that feeling. I feel kind of numb now and it is definitely a situational depression and now it\u2019s bad. I can tell. I had band practice yesterday and it was good. It was good, but I\u2019m not motivated. I\u2019m having trouble <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">enjoying it. I don\u2019t fucking know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to take in the reality of where things are. There is so much feeling. It\u2019s almost unbearable. [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:11)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (sighs) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: What are you feeling, Brian?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Not much. I\u2019m sad, I\u2019m angry, I feel nauseous. I have no fucking idea. It\u2019s a joke. This is insanity. That\u2019s the biggest thing that, I think, can drive you insane, is when you\u2019re in a maddening situation. You\u2019re not poor, but you\u2019re impoverished. Go try to explain this to people who really are <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">impoverished. I don\u2019t know what to say about it. I really don\u2019t because I feel like my feelings are false, in a way.  This is asinine. I\u2019m worried about rubbing two nickels together. I have hundreds of dollars of equity in a house. Try to wrap your head around that. There are no words. I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">what to say about it. My poor mom is like, \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed, but there are ladies my age who get food stamps and stuff.\u201d What the fuck are we talking about? Are you kidding me? There is nothing wrong with that, of course, but what is happening here? (pause) Part of me is like it\u2019s time to sell the house. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">It\u2019s time to sell the house. We tried. We\u2019d love to keep it and buy another house.  Maybe we just put it on the market for some fucking ridiculously high price because we\u2019re not in a rush. It is what it is anyway. We\u2019re getting by somehow, I guess; not great, but then if someone wants to pay us $900,000 <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">or something . . . Or I\u2019m honestly just going to start hitting real estate offices and be like, \u201cListen, man. Let\u2019s cut the crap. You need to help me find someone, and I\u2019ll give you a cut or whatever \u2013 I don\u2019t care. You need to help me find people.\u201d In the old days \u2013 not old days \u2013 ten years ago or <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200215\">20 years ago in Cheshire, they\u2019re fucking dead now unfortunately, but there were these old dudes that had a lot of money. They were real estate guys and you would just go to them and be like, \u201cHey, buddy, listen. I\u2019ve got my three-family. Here\u2019s the situation.\u201d I don\u2019t even need all the equity. We have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200216\">like $500,000 of equity in that fucking house.  I just want $300,000 of it. $250,000 give me $250,000. Whatever. I\u2019m so tired of talking about this. It\u2019s even driving me crazy, but I need to find someone like that; just be like, \u201cListen, man. I\u2019m going to take that money and I\u2019m going to immediately <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200217\">buy something else. Charge me high interest \u2013 whatever. This needs to somehow happen.\u201d I don\u2019t know. And if I can\u2019t find anyone to do that, then I really don\u2019t see what choice there is. I think we have to sell the house; unless I get some amazing job that pays me over $50,000 or $60,000 a year, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200218\">I can\u2019t get a job stapling paper in an office.

You said once last week that maybe it\u2019s too good to be true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I felt like I had done my research. It is good. We could still do it and it would make a difference, but in this scenario the long term is very shaky because that\u2019s going to be a lot of money that\u2019s owed and then it\u2019s harder to draw again.  You\u2019re drawing from it so it\u2019s hard to go <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">to a bank or somewhere else, so it doesn\u2019t work. The guy was a really nice guy, but I think he should have just told me. He must have had an idea because I was very honest with him. I said, \u201cThis is what we\u2019re hoping to do, so this is what we need.\u201d He must have known on some level what the formulas <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200252\">are. I mean, come on, there\u2019s a big difference between $80,000 or whatever it is and . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: And $580,000. You said $580,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: $584,000. So I don\u2019t know what that was about. I don\u2019t know why he \u2013 you know. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you would essentially open up a home equity line, the original [plan] (ph?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: They\u2019re both, basically, home equity lines. They\u2019re just vastly different amounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: But with a home equity, in other words, that\u2019s probably all you would have expected to get. It depends on who is signing it, I suppose, given that the mortgage is already $300,000. Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561572\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s just disappointing. (long pause)  This is a lot. (long pause)  It wouldn\u2019t have been this way if your dad were here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Who the fuck knows? Maybe it would have. I have no idea. (pause) This is what happens. You come from this kind of background and if your family isn\u2019t fucking savvy \u2013 they think they\u2019re savvy, but they\u2019re not. They think that because they bought a house it\u2019s \u2013 whatever. This is what happens; <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200351\">and then there you are. It just gets passed from generation to generation. That\u2019s all it is. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Or when there\u2019s no guidance or you\u2019re not seeing any and then your dad dies which would have even been, in a way, a kind of role model and someone who is still keeping up with bills and furthering his own financial livelihood and there to show you the ropes. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s unbearable that there\u2019s no one there to help. You\u2019re facing the aloneness head on. It\u2019s so much that the urge to not face it is powerful. [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:44) something even that good with this mortgage which, to me, you said it felt too good to be true. I wouldn\u2019t be <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">surprised if it worked out in that way because it\u2019s not. I know it\u2019s almost like opening a home-equity line for an elderly person who needs it to finish living, but that\u2019s about it.  It could be, for a moment, it could kind of be someone \u2013 a dad or a replacement dad or a replacement mom, even, who will <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200392\">finally help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">CLIENT: Maybe. I don\u2019t look at it that way, though. I\u2019m just trying to figure shit out. (pause) Yeah, now I feel helpless, but it was a decent plan I thought. I was trying not to get too worked up about it, but I did all my research. There was nowhere that said that, generally, people will get only <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B1\">$70,000.  It said it\u2019s your equity. It\u2019s a way for you to t tap into the equity of your home. (chuckles) The equity of our home is not $70,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">THERAPIST: And nowhere gave the percentages and he didn\u2019t, is what you\u2019re saying, which is so kind of weird for the person not to know that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: Maybe it was just like \u2013 who knows. He was a nice guy. Maybe he just wanted to explain in detail that it might still be worth doing or whatever. Who the fuck knows? I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t even matter. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard for you to really feel what you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s like there is so much feeling \u2013 outrage, despair, sadness, shame. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: I could move downstairs to live with my mom again to get the rent from my unit, but I can\u2019t. [I mean I\u2019m fucking out of a job] (ph?). Then I\u2019ll be sort of clinically depressed. I can\u2019t do it. I have some semblance of a refuge. I just can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t do it. Dignity, to some extent. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: And selling one of the units doesn\u2019t feel like an option?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: It does. It does. We could sell the first-floor unit and have more than enough; sell it for like $350,000 \u2013 whatever \u2013 and we would still have $100,000 profit, no more mortgage and two units. But again, these things are just not ideal. Then it\u2019s a condo. Then there are condo things you have <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200471\">to do and you don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to fucking live . . . You end up not liking the owner. Do you know what I mean? That\u2019s a really worrisome thing. You can be as picky as you want, but you don\u2019t really know once people get in there and whatever and whatever, what their day-to-day living is like and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200472\">how much noise they make. Who knows? Then you have a fucking problem on your hands. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20046-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20046-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561572\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m struck that that feels just as worrisome as not having any money. There\u2019s something about it that I don\u2019t quite understand, like why that is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Okay, you have money now; but, for example, what can I do? We\u2019re still in that house. It\u2019s not like a shitload of money where I can just go and pay cash for something and that way, even if the people that buy the new place are kind of whatever \u2013 fine. I don\u2019t live there anymore. I own it, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B1\">I don\u2019t live there anymore. Now it\u2019s an investment. Okay, we don\u2019t have that, but if I have to deal with shitty neighbors who are not tenants, they own one-third of that house. That\u2019s a major fucking . . . It\u2019s almost worth it to me to just figure something else out. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019re worried that it would feel so intrusive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: Because of your mother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">CLIENT: Because of my mother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">THERAPIST: Well, your history. There\u2019s something you\u2019re very sensitive to about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I\u2019ve talked about it, right? Over the years I\u2019m more sensitive to noise. I don\u2019t like feeling encroached upon and I get that this is an unusual extent of sensitivity to that because it would be kind of nice to not have a mortgage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">THERAPIST: And have $100,000 and your mother then taken care of by the tenant. No, she\u2019s not, but her mortgage is paid off, really, so she doesn\u2019t owe that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Her mortgage is paid and now you have two units. Then I think it would be a lot easier. Then, actually, the reverse mortgage might work because they don\u2019t have to pay your mortgage as part of the reverse mortgage. That was the other thing with this reverse mortgage thing. We could have taken <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">a lot, but they\u2019re paying $290,000 or $260,000, so that\u2019s gone.  That\u2019s your mortgage that they\u2019re paying off; so it would have been a big chunk. The problem with selling the house is it\u2019s not just me. I\u2019ve got to move my mom, a 70-something-year-old woman. That\u2019s a major ordeal. If it was just me, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">that\u2019s totally different. That might be what has to happen. I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: It might not be the right thing for you, either. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to understand [and get some sense of what you feel] (ph?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s the problem. That\u2019s why this is maddening. I don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t know what the right thing is to do or not to do. Everybody has an opinion. I can go to five different real estate people and they\u2019re all going to tell me something different. It\u2019s just fucking, really . . .  (pause) <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">And, by the way, to even do that condo thing, you need like $5,000. That takes money that we don\u2019t have, so there you go. I would want to fix it up a little bit. I want to get good money for that condo. I don\u2019t want to sell it just as is. I want to do a little bit of work on it. To do that, you\u2019re talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">money because that means those tenants have to leave so you can do all that work so you can make it nice, ready to go, looked at, painted a certain way. I\u2019d really want to doll it up a little bit to get good money for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561572\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">THERAPIST: You want it but you might not be able to. Do you know what I mean? You say that then as if you shouldn\u2019t do it unless you can doll it up. You can sell it as is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah, I could. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">THERAPIST: You may decide you don\u2019t want to, but that is an option. Of course it would be better if you had a lot of money to doll it up first, but if there isn\u2019t I\u2019m sort of trying to think out what the options are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: I guess what I\u2019m saying, though, is that okay, if that\u2019s the case, you still need $5,000 or $7,000 to do all the lawyer paperwork condo-izing \u2013 whatever the fuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: In which case then selling the whole thing maybe makes more sense. You can buy a two-family for less money; have some cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">CLIENT: The problem with all that is . . . Yeah, no, you\u2019re right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">THERAPIST: What?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">CLIENT: What\u2019s maddening is that it\u2019s just maddening to not hold onto what we have and buy something else. That\u2019s the goal here.  It seems insane to me that there\u2019s no possibility whatever in doing that. That\u2019s not possible. There are too many people in real estate who would see the value in what I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F1\">trying to do, so there\u2019s got to be someone that would like to make money, too, to help me do that. It\u2019s money. I get it. It\u2019s not a charity, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. Someone would like to make money by giving me money to invest in something that\u2019s clearly going to make money. It\u2019s fucking Cheshire. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F2\">I\u2019m not buying from Timbuktu. Do you know what I mean? If anything goes wrong, they know that there\u2019s more than enough for them to recoup what they\u2019ve given me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">THERAPIST: So this is where you\u2019re talking about finding someone with a lot of money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">CLIENT: It\u2019s a hard-money loan. It\u2019s called a hard-money loan or cross-collateralization. There\u2019s either got to be some small financial institution that does that shit or I\u2019ve just got to hit the pavement and find people and just present to people that look, man, this is the situation.  I\u2019m not trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200731\">to be a real estate mogul, but I want to have more than three or four properties in the next five to eight years. It\u2019s not rocket science. I have tons of equity. It could easily be done. I just need someone to . . . Is it a risk? I guess it is, but not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s riskier for them than another investment, right, like if they went and bought the property themselves?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">CLIENT: It is and it isn\u2019t. What\u2019s the risk really? They\u2019re charging a higher interest rate. Those loans charge like seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve percent interest. They\u2019re not giving me even close to the maximum equity in my home. I\u2019m going to buy something in Cheshire.  Do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s only if you were to default on your loan to them, then they have to pay legal fees to recoup the money, to repossess the house. It\u2019s just a hassle for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s how they would look at it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: I guess, but my view is that these are people that kind of do that shit anyway. It wouldn\u2019t be up for someone who has never given money. This is what they do, kind of.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2007E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561572\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">THERAPIST: So that\u2019s a particular person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">THERAPIST: (laughs) No, I don\u2019t know those kinds of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">CLIENT: No, they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re just a lot harder to find. These are real estate terms that even banks used to do it. It\u2019s almost like a business proposition. You\u2019re almost doing a business proposal.  I\u2019ve done all my numbers. Yes, of course, it\u2019s a risk, but it\u2019s a very calculated minimal risk <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200871\">to the person who is putting up the money. I don\u2019t know. If I can\u2019t find anyone like that, I think then we have to sell. But again, I don\u2019t know how that would happen. We would have to borrow money from my uncle again and I can\u2019t take that anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">THERAPIST: It sounds like this feels worth inquiring about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, because it seems impossible to me that it would be impossible. (laughs) That doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019ve known \u2013 not me personally \u2013 but I\u2019ve known that in the last 20 years there are lots of people in Cheshire who that\u2019s exactly what they did.  There were just people that they would go to <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B1\">who were just fucking rich; and they were rich in real estate specifically. And there is something slightly altruistic about it. There are people who are like, \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to make money, but I get what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m a business guy. I get what you\u2019re saying. It is fucking ridiculous that you <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B2\">can\u2019t tap into your own fucking money. So yeah, I\u2019m not going to give you $300,000. Here\u2019s $200,000 and I\u2019m going to charge you 14% interests.\u201d Everybody wins. (chuckles) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible at all. I think it\u2019s harder to get done. I don\u2019t know. Who the fuck knows?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">THERAPIST: You sound like you know more about it than I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: I do because I know it\u2019s a little less common than it used to be, but then again, what do I know? Maybe it isn\u2019t. Now financially things are so tough that people can\u2019t get money from the banks. Even when they have jobs they can\u2019t get money from the banks.  It\u2019s almost like things are going cyclically <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">\u2013 do you know what I mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yes, maybe it\u2019s on the horizon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah, so who knows? And again, business is business. Business people aren\u2019t fucking stupid. They have a lot of money and they see what Cheshire, Hamden, Shrewsbury \u2013 they know what these places and what the market is. This kid wants to take $290,000 from his hundreds of thousands of dollars <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200931\">of equity and (chuckles) buy a nice one-bedroom condo in Cheshire. (laughs) If worse comes to worse, I\u2019m going to sell it in eight months for $310,000. It just seems so ridiculously simple. Nothing is guaranteed, but there is risk and then there is common sense calculated risk based on years and years <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200932\">and years of living somewhere and seeing just what the facts are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: In the storyline about how hard it is for people to get mortgages, to get home-equity loans or if they get it, it\u2019s much less than they thought it was going to be. That seems the norm in everything I hear about, but this is a different avenue that isn\u2019t in the banking world, where everything <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200951\">is tight. They\u2019re not giving loans to people who have a million dollars right now, that kind of thing. I hear that all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: No, this is just private; people who see opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: Where there\u2019s something \u2013 a heart kind of connection to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20098-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20098-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561572\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B\">CLIENT: A little bit, more of a human connection. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not just going to give it to me and that might be. They might be like, \u201cYou\u2019ve never done anything like this before. Usually we just deal with people who have a history of real estate.\u201d In that case, I would have to bring my uncle into <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2009B1\">it. I would have to be, \u201cMy uncle is going to be supervising;\u201d some people to vouch for me or whatever.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009D\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m sorry this is such a disappointment . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2009F\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A1\">THERAPIST: . . . from what you were hoping for. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah, that\u2019s what you do. It\u2019s very natural. You want to be hopeful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: What are you going to do? (pause)  And it was 50% accurate. (chuckles) We could do it and it would make big changes. Of course, when you don\u2019t have any more mortgage payments and you have $70,000. That\u2019s still pretty good. It just fucks up any plans to really be able to buy another property. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200A71\">I did think about calling Jim back and saying, \u201cIf we did this, how does that affect me doing what I\u2019m saying now to you?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A9\">THERAPIST: With a private investor?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AB\">CLIENT: A private investor or even a bank, having a different home equity loan or whatever. How would it affect that? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Right, whether the debt is going to go in your name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF\">CLIENT: Something like that. I would just be curious because maybe it\u2019s still worth it. It\u2019s just a shitload of fees for not that much money, but on the other hand, that\u2019s $20,000 \u2013 more than that.  It\u2019s $22,000 of rental income that no longer is going to the mortgage. It\u2019s going into your pocket. From <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200AF1\">that you only have to pay $8,000 or maybe $10,000 of property taxes and shit. It\u2019s nothing to sneeze at on top of the equity line they\u2019re giving you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B1\">THERAPIST: Again it sounds like you\u2019re saying as long as there\u2019s another line of income from an investment . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B3\">CLIENT: Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B5\">THERAPIST: In other words, it\u2019s just building your debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B7\">CLIENT: Exactly. Of course. It\u2019s worth it for my mom, but not for what I\u2019m trying to do; and my mom doesn\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019m wondering if there is a way that it would not affect my ability to try to draw more on the equity that\u2019s there or from a separate source.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Next time?
