I\u2019ll talk to James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) I know it\u2019s a pain, especially with the insurance company and all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: No, but I also know, you know... you do actually need to get paid, so...

I (inaudible) the insurance company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: The woman promised me she would call me back, but I\u2019ve heard that before, so... {00:01:05}<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I\u2019ll probably call them and harass them in a couple of days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: But, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: If I had a nickel for every time the insurance company had not followed through, then I would not need to get paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. Um... yeah. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when it comes time to renew my insurance. I don\u2019t really want them to be my insurer anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: Right, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: But on the other hand, I don\u2019t think anywhere else is going to be any better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I don\u2019t know that anywhere else is better, I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: I wish I hadn\u2019t complained, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: That\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll see. Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">Well, James and I finally talked about why he\u2019s been sort of blowing up at me all the time recently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: It was a good talk, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) He said that (pause) you know, I think he\u2019s still really angry with me. And feels like I abandoned him, and he\u2019s having a really hard time trusting me. You know, I have a lot of \u201cmake it better.\u201d This kind of thing can\u2019t, just like, make it better. It\u2019s just, you know, the time frame.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Which makes it -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: And this is from?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Me, wanting to kill myself. And having to be honest about a lot of stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: I think that\u2019s the big part of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think he sort of feels like I left him. Which, you know, (chuckles) I understand pretty well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: At the same time, I really do feel like everything I told him is sort of hard to remember, understand, or wrap my head around his, you know, feeling so abandoned and being so angry because I\u2019m just really proud of myself that I\u2019m still here. (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">CLIENT: And I sort of feel like I\u2019ve been working as hard as I can, and doing everything I can not to leave him. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">So, yeah, you know. I told him that he could be angry with me for as long as he needed to, and I\u2019ll stick around. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">Um... so basically what\u2019s been happening is, I will start talking about (pause) something that I\u2019m angry about, or to James, something that I feel like I am a victim of. And James doesn\u2019t deal very well with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">\u2028So, like, the other night, I was really discouraged about jobs and saying, I sort of feel like I\u2019ve done everything right since I was fourteen, and sort of feel like (pause) certainly my parents, and I feel like most other people spent a whole lot of time telling me, you know, do what you love and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200631\">follow your dreams and the money will work out. And well, the money\u2019s not working out.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099864\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: You know? Humanities degrees are not good for much, as it turns out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) You know, maybe I should have expected that, but I didn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t feel like... (pause) You know, and James just kind of blew up at me. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">I\u2019m in a spot where, like (pause) James doesn\u2019t want me to feel like I have to censor what I have to say to him, or I have to, like, shut down. I would not like that, and I\u2019m not very good at that. You know? I don\u2019t have much of a filter with him. But at the same time, it doesn\u2019t really get us anywhere. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: It just really doesn\u2019t help either of us for me to say, \u201cI feel this way,\u201d and him to say, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel this way.\u201d We both get angry, we both feel bad. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019m a little confused. Because (pause) you\u2019re saying that (pause) you didn\u2019t think it was right but you both thought it was totally helpful for him to say, \u201cLook, what I\u2019m really angry about is, you know, that you would think about abandoning me like someone else did.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s probably one of the reasons why when you were growing up you did that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: And you\u2019re also saying that (pause), you know, when you say these particular things he gets mad, and I gather, goes like, \u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t be upset about that, you know.\u201d But you\u2019re saying you\u2019re upset about having done the right...? I mean, I get why you\u2019d say that you\u2019re upset about <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">feeling like you\u2019ve done the right thing since you were fourteen, and... you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And his response was, basically, \u201cYou knew, like... you knew this was going to happen. People did tell you to, like, take more math and science, or whatever.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah, sort of.\u201d I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like... his answers aren\u2019t wrong. It\u2019s just, it is hurtful to me that it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D1\">like he doesn\u2019t hear the part where I am hurting. So... (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">You know, and (pause) most of it is just, like, I\u2019m just really angry, and don\u2019t quite know how to handle that, don\u2019t know what to be angry at. (pause) And I\u2019m kind of trying not to just be angry at myself, because that\u2019s not good for me either. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: So when he says, \u201cWell, you know, actually, you have been kind of told that,\u201d what is it that you want to say back? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: (pause) Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">THERAPIST: Are you thinking anything like... (pause) It\u2019s not that I have no idea, but I\u2019m curious how you see how he\u2019s missing the point you\u2019re making there. I understand that he\u2019s not sort of sympathetic to your speaking in a way peacefully a part of you that\u2019s hurt. I think I get that. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">CLIENT: Um... (pause) Hm. The problem is, I don\u2019t (pause) I don\u2019t know what it, what I want him to say. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">THERAPIST: My hunch is there\u2019s something in his response that shuts you down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">I guess mostly I just want to know, why are you so angry at me about this? You know? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">Why does it piss you off that I feel like my life isn\u2019t fair? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">He keeps saying he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful for me to think about things these ways, or think about things. And he doesn\u2019t think it will move me forward. Which is fine, but you know, I don\u2019t think things because they\u2019re helpful. I mean, I try to, but (chuckles) I don\u2019t think it happens. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20090-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20090-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099864\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Um, I think I just about universally hate the position that you (pause) always think things partly because they\u2019re helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: What do you mean by that, or do you have an example? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah. Um... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: I think I know what you mean. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I think you\u2019re trying to reclaim something from being angry about this bit of your life, and what you don\u2019t have. (pause) Um... (pause) I\u2019m not exactly sure what it is. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being angry at the people who told you just to do what you love, and not think about the money, or <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B1\">if you\u2019re angry at the world being the kind of place that doesn\u2019t sort of make the kind of opportunities that you want and that it should? (pause) Or what exactly you\u2019re angry about. But I\u2019m pretty confident you have a point. It doesn\u2019t mean necessarily that you\u2019re, in some sense, right about everything, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B2\">I don\u2019t mean that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not right about everything.

(chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019ll leave that to you (chuckles) But it\u2019s about something that matters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I imagine you may also be sort of (pause) probably testing me a little bit to you know, sort of, worry that maybe, really, you don\u2019t have a point being angry about that, and that I\u2019m going to (pause) say that, \u201cAh, you really shouldn\u2019t pay attention to that, you should try to focus on other <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A31\">things. It doesn\u2019t really matter what you\u2019re upset about,\u201d or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Hm. I know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">I mean, yes in the sense that (pause) every conversation I have with you...(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">CLIENT: There\u2019s always a question, is he going to drop me?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">THERAPIST: I see.

I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, it sounds like (pause) it\u2019s feeling to you that you\u2019re getting a similar response to being angry as you, I guess, had gotten from your dad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B3\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not trying to say James is coming from the same place as your dad, or sort of generally reacts to you being angry or upset that way, but in this case I imagine it feels like that to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, you know, it feels like their reasons and their personalities are widely different, but the result is kind of the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) I thought I would sort of put into words as, there\u2019s really no youthful point, or no point at all, to feeling that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BD\">I mean, I also think of it as, it makes me uncomfortable for you to be this way. So, I certainly don\u2019t want to hear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C1\">CLIENT: That\u2019s more Papa than James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I see. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C5\">CLIENT: You know, I just (pause) I can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s the thing it\u2019s most like from here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C7\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200C9\">CLIENT: I just can\u2019t tell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

(chuckles) Somehow that makes me feel better? (chuckles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, of course. Sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: He was so afraid to just have the conversation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E1\">CLIENT: His point was, he doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to say something that\u2019s going to upset me and set me off. And (pause) I don\u2019t really have any reassurance to give him. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E3\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re pretty much worried about falling apart at any time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And for any ordinary discernible reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200EB\">Yeah, based on my own experience and people I know, like, this is going to come back. In some ways, it\u2019s not really gone. I\u2019ve had a good two weeks, so... And, yeah. I don\u2019t, don\u2019t know what to do about it. Don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s that much that I can do about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200ED\">But at the same time, I ought to be able to do something about it.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F1\">CLIENT: In some ways, it\u2019s not fair to us to trust it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) it seems to me you\u2019re going a little global. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F5\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F7\">THERAPIST: There are particular types of things that set you off, and it\u2019s not always easy to predict which things that happen of those types will. But (pause) a lot of things don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200F9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FB\">A lot of things do, though. That\u2019s the thing too. (pause) Yeah. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Like, of the two things you mentioned, his saying he was angry at you and explaining why, it didn\u2019t shut you down. Actually, you responded pretty assertively to it, as I understand. You didn\u2019t need to say you overrode what he was saying, but you sort of both told him something along the lines <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD1\">of you feel that way, and you\u2019ll feel that way all you want as far as you\u2019re concerned. You\u2019re not going anywhere. But at the same time (pause) you could have told me... your other side of it. Which is like, \u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d You feel pretty strongly about it, and it\u2019s a pretty different <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200FD2\">point of view from his. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20101\">THERAPIST: Whereas in the other conversation, when he (pause) told you something along the lines of, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in being upset like that, that\u2019s not going to help you,\u201d or, no, he said a little more curtly, he said, \u201cI have told you, you should take other stuff, math and science.\u201d There, it seemed <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201011\">to me, you kind of lost your point very quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20103\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20105\">THERAPIST: And when you got in here, you\u2019re trying to recover, your thought was like, \u201cWhy are you getting so mad at me for being upset about this,\u201d or something like that. Which is a good question and an important thing, but was not actually the point you started with. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s that, I\u2019m <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N201051\">just saying -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20107\">CLIENT: No, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20109\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s you like, under a kind of onslaught from him that way, quickly abandon what you were feeling angry about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D\">THERAPIST: You know, I mean, I\u2019m just making shit up now that you could have said. Like, \u201cYes, clearly the only people who have jobs out there have studied math and science.\u201d Or, you know, \u201cThat\u2019s why Harvard only has graduate programs in math and science.\u201d Or you know, what you would have said that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2010D1\">would have been, I mean, those other things aren\u2019t quite right, but could\u2019ve you worked feeling something and in another context, are usually at a loss for words or argument. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2010C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2010C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099864\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2010F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20111\">THERAPIST: But this is a (pause) so charged, I think, when you\u2019re angry and somebody kind of strikes you down like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah, and so I guess (pause) So part of what I think I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s not clear to me (pause) why I (pause) get so shut down sometimes and don\u2019t other times. (pause) You know? Sometimes James snaps at me, and it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d and then I continue on with my day. Sometimes <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201131\">James snaps at me, and it shuts down the entire day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">CLIENT: And (pause) you know, on a larger scale, the kind of normal talk thing that people deal with, sometimes I deal with him and (pause) then I continue on with my day, and sometimes I just can\u2019t. And it sends me spiraling down, and (crying) it\u2019s scary for me not to know how I\u2019m going to react, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201171\">not to feel like I\u2019m in control of that in any way. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) I mean, let\u2019s look at those two situations. In those you did react pretty differently. (pause) I mean, do you have thoughts? I have some, but I... (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B\">I guess one of the things that\u2019s coming to me, he was sort of jumping on you for how you were feeling bad. Like more frustrated than angry. And he kind of jumped on that. Which seems to me, kind of sides with the part of you that always feels like, you shouldn\u2019t be upset, you should just have done better, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2011B1\">and stuff like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2011F\">THERAPIST: The other one is just different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I mean it is, I just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t worry about abandoning him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">CLIENT: I\u2019m sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">THERAPIST: You don\u2019t worry about abandoning him any more than they abandoned him. I heard that, at least you said it to me very strongly, that he\u2019s the reason you\u2019re still alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012B\">THERAPIST: And like sort of feeling that he\u2019s not... he\u2019s awesome, but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re still alive. It\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to do that to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012D\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2012F\">So it\u2019s like, he\u2019s angry at me for something I\u2019m not already angry at myself about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that you feel kind of, \u201cFuck you.\u201d You feel quite confident about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20133\">CLIENT: Yeah. Okay. I can see that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20135\">THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe your reasons are different but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20137\">CLIENT: Hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20139\">THERAPIST: Maybe another example like that would be when, didn\u2019t he say, was it last week where he said, \u201cOh, well, we should have a conversation about money.\u201d And that (pause) as I recall was devastating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah, that didn\u2019t feel right. I mean, we did talk about money, it went pretty well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Right. Maybe if you had been more conspicuous in a way, like, because like, what he originally said was, \u201cOh, we should have a conversation about money.\u201d Which is something, I think, you\u2019re terribly upset with yourself about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20141\">THERAPIST: And he wasn\u2019t mad, so what seemed more conspicuous was, he wasn\u2019t mad, he wasn\u2019t, as I heard it, accusatory or mean. He was more like, \u201cOh, we need to figure this out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
