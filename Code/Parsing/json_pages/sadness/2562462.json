they could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yep. (pause) I think James feels better this week; we just talked yesterday more, and I think he feels more \u2013 more like I\u2019m hearing what he\u2019s saying. I\u2019m not sure about me. (chuckle) (pause)  (pause) Yeah, I still sort of feel like I\u2019ve (pause) put out a couple of things that were not working <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">for me, and they\u2019re sort of beating at me. And it sort of feels like, well I can\u2019t do anything about it or I won\u2019t do anything about it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: That you put them out and you said that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: And he said that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: He said that; that\u2019s what I thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. That like (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Right, that\u2019s freaking you out about not knowing where you\u2019re going to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I was like, \u201cDo you have any sort of timeline?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no I really don\u2019t.\u201d (pause)  (pause) And that \u2013 yeah. I feel like the times of my life right now where I\u2019m doing well, and can sort of be somebody that I like, are like at work, and mostly like with church stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">He can\u2019t share the work stuff, and he\u2019s just isn\u2019t interested in sharing the church stuff. And it\u2019s not like \u2013 it\u2019s not the like going to church part that I like, because I had dealt with that, and that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s more like there\u2019s all of the social stuff around it, and he just won\u2019t go to any of it with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It sort of sucks to have everyone know you\u2019re married, and nobody\u2019s ever met your husband. I\u2019m like, you\u2019re always going to parties alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: True.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:03:05]-[0:04:05] (pause) I think for him, the thing that sort of \u2013 I mean it hurts, but it feels like he\u2019s working so hard, and doing so much, and he has so much stuff sort of weighing on him. And I\u2019m saying like, \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: Or. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing enough.\u201d But it\u2019s like, \u201cWell I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to dismiss what you\u2019re doing, because I see it, and I value it, and I always do, not just when you point it out. But the plan is not necessarily either of us for me to say like what you\u2019re doing is what I need; <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">it\u2019s not. Like it doesn\u2019t help for me to say that I\u2019m being taken care of more than I need.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">And he was like, \u201cYeah I could.\u201d (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s talking like if he\u2019s thinking of for example, some of what he\u2019s working so hard at is like [kid work] (ph) stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Because that \u2013 that is absolutely hard word, and can be stressful and everything else. But it\u2019s not (inaudible at 00:05:29); is that a certain thing you had in mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not like \u2013 (sigh) taken care is maybe the wrong word. I guess I think like \u2013 (sigh) I think I said something like, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t serve us for me that this situation\u2019s working for me.\u201d I actually felt like I get that he is \u2013 so he\u2019s like, he\u2019s finishing his thesis, and stuff, and he\u2019s working <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">on finishing a paper, and finishing writing his thesis, finishing up his other paper and applying for jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">And like that\u2019s hard, and I know that that is what stands in the way of him applying for jobs, and I know that he is working on it. But it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t help that I don\u2019t \u2013 like I have to say I don\u2019t know when this is going to happen and it\u2019s really hard for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562462\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">I am not saying this well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: No, no, I\u2019m not furrowing my brow because of that. I mean maybe the thing I don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s a few things I don\u2019t understand. (chuckle) One of them is, so if his plan continues to be to revise his thesis, get this paper out, and then apply for jobs, I guess I don\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">give you a rough idea of when he\u2019ll be applying for jobs. Because assuming he expects to graduate this spring, there must be something in line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. (overlapping voices) Well he\u2019s already turned \u2013 he did turn in his thesis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: But yeah; no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I mean even if he says like within the next three or four months, the paper will \u2013 I mean -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: So maybe there must be something I don\u2019t get. (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think I could either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: All right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t (pause) (overlapping voices) I feel like I\u2019m trying to narrow him down from a timeline of like a year or two; within that three-month range. And he was just like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell want to tell me, or he couldn\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t know why. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: So you either. Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. What was the other thing you don\u2019t understand? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: There was one, I think it was sort of in the details of like (pause) I know what you mean, but why go to the church stuff, or like from you I get the feel that it means to you he\u2019s seems sort of closed off to it. Or (pause) what he\u2019s feeling so burdened by, that at the same doesn\u2019t feel to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">you like it (pause) I don\u2019t know you said, like it helps know the situation works better for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">I mean like there\u2019s the work stuff that I kind of see, but you know, sometimes he doesn\u2019t really do both stuff around the house. But I guess I would imagine that would feel like it\u2019d make things work better for you, if that\u2019s the kind of stuff you need to do, maybe it doesn\u2019t. And maybe that\u2019s not what <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">he\u2019s referring to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">So like then again, maybe it\u2019s not important for me to know, I\u2019m not sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Or maybe it\u2019s uncomfortable to talk about. I don\u2019t know that either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: I \u2013 I don\u2019t that I have much of a better handle on it. Like I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s that clear to me. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Go ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: So like in doing the \u2013 in the fact that he does most of the work that sort of keeps us running, in some ways that takes a big huge burden off me, but like in other ways, it really \u2013 it makes \u2013 like I just feel constantly guilty, and I constantly feel like I\u2019m failing in these ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Right. I know you mentioned yesterday -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Feeling like he\u2019s grudging it, or he doesn\u2019t want to be doing that. And he doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019s never going to tell me that he doesn\u2019t \u2013 that like in any specific instance, \u201cHey, can you do this?\u201d And I have a really hard time like if let to my own devices, I\u2019m still sort of only marginally functional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">So like I need someone like pushing me in some ways. But I guess he\u2019s not going to do that. And it\u2019s not really reasonable to ask him to. So I have to sort of (pause) figure out another way of doing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562462\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: You know, that I get. I mean the two (hems) (ph) that come to my mind are work, where there\u2019re certain times you\u2019ve got to be there, and maybe you do, and that\u2019s sort of part of their main expectations. Like you can kind of get organized around that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s like their expectations, but their clear expectations. And I feel like with James, he had expectations, but he feels like he can\u2019t tell me what they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Right. So then you say like a job chart would help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Which I imagine it would be kind of in a similar way, which would seem very clear in structure and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Ah-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: But he doesn\u2019t want to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I\u2019m just going to deal with that like this is what I\u2019m doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: He can do whatever he wants, but this is what I\u2019m going to do. (pause) I feel like there\u2019s something like \u2013 it feels to me like there\u2019s something going on with him with the work. And that it\u2019s hard for him in ways that don\u2019t have anything to do with me. And that he\u2019s not willing to tell me about <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">them or make them not be about me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know (chuckle) what I can do about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: And when you\u2019re saying work there, do you mean broadly including stuff in the house, or do you mean his academic work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: His academic work and applying for jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Like he doesn\u2019t want an issue there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">THERAPIST: That he doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge as such or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And I both to respect that, and say like, \u201cWell you know, I\u2019m here if you want me. But otherwise, yeah, you can figure it out if you want to. Like just do that. But also this is directly affecting me. This is my life too, and \u201c I don\u2019t know. (crying) (pause) (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">THERAPIST: And do you know what it is with the church stuff? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">CLIENT: Not really. I know that like (pause) he doesn\u2019t really get what he needs spiritually out of the church, which is fine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Right. Yeah that\u2019s a thought we have an issue with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">CLIENT: No. (pause) It sort of feels like he doesn\u2019t really like being in the position of like being Mary Poppins; like being that is how people relate to him. But that was one of the things that he didn\u2019t like about going to church there. That like, \u201cOh your Mary Poppins.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">And like I respect that in a church setting, but sometimes you just have to go to a party to meet my husband. Like that\u2019s what being married is, like that\u2019s the thing. (pause) And I think he also just doesn\u2019t really like the (inaudible at 0:16:04). Which is fine, but (pause) again like, (pause) (sigh) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">I\u2019d do it for him.

That you know I get to sort of push back, or have it the way I want it or not give you the things you want in <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A32\">these other areas, because I\u2019m giving so much of it here,\u201d is the impression.

It also sort of feels like he\u2019s saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the depression, and it\u2019s this huge thing in our lives, and it makes you like not the person that I fell in love with. Like it\u2019s not the side \u2013 it\u2019s not the best of you, and that\u2019s gone.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">I\u2019m sort of saying, \u201cWell, here are these places where I\u2019m trying to get back. Like here are these places where I\u2019m trying to come back to myself; come be there with me.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">I went out for drinks with Camilla after church last night; it was real good. I both like told her that things were bad, and told her about the thing with James, and it\u2019s really sad, and then we like drank and talked really loudly about theology, which is really my favorite thing to do.  (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">She\u2019s very similar to the people I went to William &amp; Mary, or to a lot of them in terms of like she just like gets really excited, and talks really loudly and really fast, and it\u2019s just like, \u201cCamilla!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">THERAPIST: She\u2019s one of the (inaudible at 0:20:47)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I miss that. (pause) But I think that like \u2013 I think I\u2019m a good person for her also; it\u2019s the thing to be. (pause) So Walter Brueggemann who\u2019s like a giant Old Testament scholar; it\u2019s like the mid centurion leader, came to speak at Cavalry over the weekend. And -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">THERAPIST: What do you mean of the mid centurion leader?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">CLIENT: Like his most important work was published in like the 60s, I think. (overlapping voices) Yeah. And he just changed the whole face of the field, and so now he\u2019s a professor, and is apparently going around talking about what he really wants to talk about (inaudible at 00:21:55). (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">I wouldn\u2019t want to (overlapping voices)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: What I was having trouble with was like (overlapping voices). Yeah. (laughter) Eight biblical scholars is a(overlapping voices)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: It might have been a little later, but like I think he\u2019s notable. (overlapping voices) But he \u2013 so he gave a lecture on Saturday, which I went to, which was really really good; that was basically like his early work. Then apparently his lecture on Sunday; I didn\u2019t end up going to it, and it <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B91\">was like a little more problematic. Basically from what I heard, it sounded like he was talking about stuff that he didn\u2019t actually \u2013 like that wasn\u2019t really his area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">So what he was talking about both days was like bruited in his own critical study of the Bible, and then talking about what does the church need to do now? And that really works when you\u2019re sort of critical study is really sound, but when it\u2019s premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of what was happening <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB1\">in the historical time period that you\u2019re talking about, as compared to a (overlapping voices) (pneumatic) (ph) story. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: baptistery?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Yeah. Then you sort of \u2013 it turns into bad theology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: So I\u2019d gone to the first one; I hadn\u2019t gone to the second one, and there\u2019s dinner after the evening service last night. So I sat at the dinner, and Camilla came up, and she was like, \u201cI really need to talk to you about this sometime.\u201d (laughter) She was \u2013 yeah. It was nice to be sought out in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C31\">that way. And we talked really loudly about (those) (ph). (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200C2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562462\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">I\u2019m kidding you. (pause) I always get into these conversations, and then I look up and 20 minutes has gone by, and like I haven\u2019t let anybody else at the table talk. (laughter) I\u2019m like, \u201cShut down Tanya, shut down.\u201d (laughter) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">I like her because (pause) you know, when I talk to her about being depressed and [wanting it] (ph) really bad, she hears me, and she listens to me, and sort of empathizes. But she also assumes that I\u2019ll still be able to like think clearly about it and be interested in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">Which is true, it\u2019s like, you know, I am interested in it. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s \u2013 it felt like shorthand in my head. (laughter) So (pause) (sigh) one of the things that I want to talk about and think about right now, is the (interaction) (ph) between mental illness, and the church, and psychiatry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">and theology, which don\u2019t really think that they have much to say to each other (laughter) for a long time. Or like [inaudible at 00:26:19].<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">So I ended up talking with her about that, and it wasn\u2019t \u2013 (sigh) her assumption was, because you had this very painful experience in this, that makes me more able to be someone to actually talk about it, rather than not being able, which I feel like is often the case. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: I mean I\u2019m struggling not to \u2013 I don\u2019t know.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Or being unreliable sort of of whatever (happens) (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: It feels like it\u2019s been a long time since somebody treated me like I was smart.

(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Like smart as related to valuing your contribution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (pause) I\u2019m sort of stuck on what to talk about. (pause) I don\u2019t want things to be hard. (chuckle) (pause) James\u2019 doing the taxes. (pause) (chuckle)  (pause) Yeah. (pause) We\u2019re at a good place in terms of finances. (pause)  (pause) Yeah, and half of our income are in medical <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D71\">bills, that\u2019s it\u2019s worth it to itemize our deductions this year, which you\u2019re apparently agreeing with. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">And James\u2019 telling me about this that (pause) it seems like most calculated or like estimated tax withholding is like that we owe money instead of getting it back. And you know, it\u2019s looking pretty bleak. He\u2019s like, \u201cBut you know, it\u2019ll be okay. We just have to hold on, because I\u2019m going to get another <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200D91\">job soon.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cReally?\u201d (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Right.

(pause) He\u2019s wants the fight to be over, and I don\u2019t \u2013 I sometimes would <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">like to be over it too, but like I\u2019m not done being angry. But I also \u2013 or are we really even actually fixing things? (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">But I also, like I cannot respond \u2013 I cannot. Okay yeah, I feel close to you, but I\u2019m afraid (inaudible at 00:34:21) and I \u2013 (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562462\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you sort of stated your point.

What you said was, you did not feel like he was really responding to what you said in the way that you would want. So I can <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E11\">see why you\u2019d still be mad. And I can also see how in talking about Camilla, and also about talking about Camilla, and also like it\u2019s talking about Camilla, and how nice that was. But also about this sort of thing. Like you can\u2019t talk with James about work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">He doesn\u2019t feel like this sort of stuff is coming back, that he (pause) doesn\u2019t want to be part of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And (pause) what was I going tell you?

(pause) I think stepping back a little bit, or not this way for you at all. But (pause) in some \u2013 I imagine it feels like much to you like the work you\u2019ve been doing over the last I don\u2019t know, year and a half; couple of years if anything, is like dealing with this sort of depression, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF1\">and you\u2019re [a stranger] (ph) sort of (inaudible at 00:40:14) with stuff.

(pause) It\u2019s not \u2013 I just feel like I can\u2019t really \u2013 I can\u2019t talk with James about it, or it feels like that\u2019s -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: And then he feels very much outside of that.

(pause) And I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s being the case. I also feel like (pause) I just feel like when I talk to him about it, he always wants to hold me to what I said in the previous conversation. And I\u2019m like (chuckle) that\u2019s really not all correct. (laughter) Then I get really anxious <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">about it, because I feel like I have to be some like consistent person, in a way that I don\u2019t feel like I can do.
