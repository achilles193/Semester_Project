Like, yesterday, I got home after a session and just couldn't do anything for a while, for most of the rest of the day. I was just too sad. It's very frustrating. You know, I don't have much patience with myself when I'm like that, but at the same time, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">I just can't be alive or can't, can't stand the way I am. James has been very kind to me. Very insistent that I cut myself some slack and take care of myself. (pause) I think about suicide a lot. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Come back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Come back to the extent that I am, it's not clear to me how much it really went away. You know, it feels like it never really went away, but I'm not sure that's actually true. But, anyway, it's come back for at least like the last week pretty consistently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: You reported that it went away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Okay. Well, then I would believe that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Yeah. For most of the time you were doing the ECT you said you didn't think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: And, sort of even initially as you were off you said you didn't think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Okay. Well, it has come back pretty heavily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: It's a good thing I'm married. That's what makes the difference. (pause) It also feels like a bad thing that I'm married. In a lot of ways I really wish I weren't married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Because that's what makes the difference? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) If I weren't married, I wouldn't feel so guilty about it. (pause) It feels like something I just shouldn't bother you with. I guess that's probably not true, but... (laughter) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: That's correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I find myself increasingly reluctant to talk about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: You mean the suicidality?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. I wasn't, I didn't know if you were introducing something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: You were just mentioning that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: No. Which is unfortunate. (pause) I expect that I am reluctant to talk to you about it in direct proportion to my likelihood of falling from it. So, that's not good. Oh well. I just don't know what to do about it. You know, it's just I just don't think there's anything to do about it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Well, I think at least part of what's very tricky about it is that it's, it's a defense by which I mean that it's in part something you think about in order to not think about other things that are more painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: That makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I'm pretty confident of that because it's essentially what you told me a couple days ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: I'd like to take credit. No, I'm joking. But, were talking, we were talking about betrayal and feeling angry and you said something along the lines of how that gets to be too much very fast, the betrayal and the anger and you sort of described them right to a suicidalily. So, my point is that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah. That, those times are not the times I really worry too much about. That's not, I mean that's bad, but I guess the times that I worry that I am going to follow through on this are when I kind of sit up and look around at my life and say okay, well, things are just this bad and this is just <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">worse than I can take and I'm not going to be able. I'm not going to be able to take this anymore. And it just it feels very calm and it feels as though, it feels as though I am taking control of my life in some way. Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20040-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20040-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099882\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Is there an aspect of reasserting control over things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like, saying well, things are this bad and here is something I can do about that because there is nothing else I can do about that. (crying) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: It's like you're being tortured and you're helpless in a way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, it's not just me that's helpless. It's not like people aren't trying to help me. It's, there's just nothing to be done. You know, all the things that people suggest really just make things have had bad side effects. (crying) (pause) You know, therapy helps some, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">it doesn't touch it in some ways. (pause) But it helps some and I don't know. I don't know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I think something important that happened a bit or so ago. I don't know if it felt this way to you, but to me, it seemed like when you asserted that the most sort of dangerous times for you occur when you said you look around at your life and you just feel like it's too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">You feel calm, but you feel like you just can't take anymore. You know, I don't know how clearly you remember, but I had said some things before that about what I thought the generally had to do with that you had said and one thought I had as you were saying what you did it was like you were kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">like taking the ball back from me. Like, I had it, you know, and I was like dribbling it around and shooting and doing my thing or whatever and then you took it in a very deliberate way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Well, I felt like what I said earlier in the week was, you know, one thing that happened but not really the most important thing that is going on right now. Yeah. So, yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: That makes sense to me and I know that that's true, but I have another point here on it as well which is, and maybe I'm wrong, but I had the feeling that like by trying to say something or make an explanation about you being suicidality or being suicidal that I was a little bit going to explain <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200511\">it away or maybe try to take it away or reduce it something and that it was very important to you to not let that happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I don't know. I guess what I'm most clear about is that it's really important to me that this come across right to you. You know, that you understand what I am talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I am 100% convinced that there have been many times I guess in the last few days and, you know, before the ECT as well, many times when you have looked around at your life and really wanted to die. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: And, that like you've been in a kind of, you know, the sort of physical equivalent would be like intense chronic pain, because this is like emotional chronic pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: That has been unbearable and you can't think about tolerating it for more than a few seconds or a few minutes at a time when it's really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's about right. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Yeah. And, I think (pause) I think though this probably is not true at one level, but at another level is probably true that you feel as though the best way to make it clear how painful it is say to me or probably the only way to give any indication of what it's really like is to make it <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">very clear you'd rather die. I don't, I'm not saying you wouldn't. You know. I'm not saying like that...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20060-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20060-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099882\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: But that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: There are no other words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Any other words or any explanation or context or narrative could not contain how excruciating it is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean it doesn't mean I don't try to explain it. It doesn't really lend itself to wild inclinations. I mean even saying I would rather be dead is, it just doesn't mean that much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">THERAPIST: I think you fear narratives and explanations about it because they inevitably minimize.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Or kind of invalidate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: What you're going through. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Thank you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">THERAPIST: Sure. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: The problem with wanting to kill myself I have problems with this also is that I feel like I have to structure the narrative very carefully in order to make people not freak out too much about it. You know. But, I also have people tell me I have a responsibility to talk about these things and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B1\">I believe them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: I think it's also possible that there is a disconnect in you that relates to all of this which is that you do not believe how badly certain things that happen can make you feel that there could not possibly be proximal or distal causes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: For how like incredibly awful you feel. Especially when you are in it, but I think other times too. Like, you don't usually, sometimes you do, but you don't often make a connection between this happened and then I felt like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. I know. Most of the time it just feels like it springs up on me out of nowhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: I think part of the reason it is that way is because you, there's a disconnect. You don't believe that something that happened could have made you feel that incredibly bad and, and that to try to describe it that way, again, is terribly minimizing or misguided and invalidating because, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200851\">know, it feels like somebody saying yes, you stubbed your toe and that's why your whole body was wracked with horrible anguish for days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Okay. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: So, either the other person couldn't possibly bear to know how bad it is or doesn't want to think about it or like (inaudible), but like yeah. I think that's true. I think that's what kinds of feels insulting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: What? To have people give me reasons for why I feel bad?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: I don't think it's like you really want to be dead, but like you've had to fight with everything you've had and give up your entire fucking life. Not your entire life, but a lot of your life, to deal with this and, like, I don't think it's about that really. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">I know. I guess I'm more actually literary this week, because I'm thinking of another example from yesterday. There's a play I saw like decades ago. It was like Lilly Tomlin; I think and in one part of it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Was it the Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Maybe. Yeah. There's one part of it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: I did that play actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20096-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20096-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2099882\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Like, what reasons, like, reasons could have caused us to drop an atomic bomb or something? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">THERAPIST: I mean the point was like how could reasons really be worth all that much if they led us to do something like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You know, like, how could, how could...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: It's a good play. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.

I'm not; I'm not quite jumping on this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: But I don't think you're wrong.

Yeah. And, I know that hating myself is what I do when I can't handle being upset with somebody else, but it's not really clear to me how that's working. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">Mostly I just, I'm upset with myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">THERAPIST: I'm not clear when you say I don't know how that's working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">CLIENT: Like, you know, if I had to guess, I would say that I'm upset at somebody else and I'm translating that in to hating myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">CLIENT: But, I can't see that going. It can't, it doesn't feel that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see. I thought you meant you can't really see how that could be helping you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">CLIENT: Oh, no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Or, a better option. But, you mean like actually maybe that's not even, you know, that's not true, it doesn't. It sort of makes an intellectual kind of sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">I don't cry that much anymore. I used to cry all the time. It's just not how I function anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I remember you would just sort of cry for hours at home, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: Yes. I just don't seem to anymore. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">It feels like I have better control over myself, but I have no way of knowing whether that's actually true or not. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">It feels like, I don't know. I just feel like crying is basically feeling sorry for myself and I just don't have much room for that or something or much patience for it. It's just not what I want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: We should finish up now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
