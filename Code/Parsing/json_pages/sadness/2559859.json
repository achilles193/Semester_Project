A lot of painting. Not so much I haven't really been feeling so much really, really empty and (unclear) darkness.

I just inherited that whole part of whatever part his sleep chromosomes are. I found myself this has happened once before with the same photograph a photograph of this woman and dream of this ocean next to my bed, so this big and it's attached to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">wall by like a piece of twine and like a bracket and just this morning about 1 a.m., I found myself like yanking the photograph off the wall and I've done this once before. I don't remember what happened that time but it was more gentle before. But I couldn't really see, I couldn't really control my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F2\">actions but I was aware, but then woke up, but was half asleep. And we had a big talk this morning about how have to be gentle with sleepwalkers. He was not gentle and he thought he was being gentle. He was like, 'what are you doing?' And like, 'stop, please stop.' And I think I responded, 'what exactly <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F3\">is the goal here?' And then when he said, 'please stop,' I said, 'I'm trying but it's twisted.' And he said, 'are you awake?' And I answered yes and I remember answering yes but don't remember being able to control like my hands and I remember being so terrified and upset and like totally traumatized at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20053\">CLIENT: So eventually I like pulled the bracket off the wall and the photograph and I fully woke up and put it down and tried to go back to sleep, but I was really like shaken up so I woke Jeremy up again. We talked for a while. And then I had to pee and he had to pee and the dryer was making a lot <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200531\">of noise and eventually I settled down to flower gardens and went back to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559859\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Flower gardens?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: The ones in my heart. It's an imagery I that I've been finding really, really useful. I've gotten some peace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">(Pause): [00:08:35 00:08:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: My dad sleepwalks sometimes. He did a lot during his PhD and he was much worse. He would roam around the house and he walked through a glass door once and (inaudible). He was okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: What happened? I mean, he was okay but (unclear) doors?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">(Pause): [00:09:19 00:09:48]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: What happened to your those shoes that showed up one day?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Those are my older shoes and I couldn't these shoes so I wore those shoes. But you liked those shoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I liked them. I like these, too. I think you need a leather bag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I have one that I used to bring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: What's it like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: It's mostly black with brown trim. It's a cool shape. It looks like a briefcase but it's not as wide as a briefcase. And it's really (unclear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: Do you have a strap?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Like for your shoulder?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">THERAPIST: It does, but I took it off. But the handle broke and I haven't gotten it fixed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">CLIENT: Yeah, straps are sturdy. But you already have one. So the dream later in the night was this Jay\/Carla love fest with no touching and no sexualness. It was like maybe what it would be like if you crossed all the other boundaries, so it was dark and really late at night. You were lying here. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200771\">think I was sitting there, but we were very close to each other and it reminds me of another dream I had a couple of weeks ago where the whole dream was just us like holding hands but the way that you would like during a long concert or a long play, or something, started like playful and exploratory <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200772\">and I think Jeremy and I have done a lot of exploring each other's hands and massaging each other hands. I like to push his cuticles down which he hates (inaudible). So I don't know if this is during a session thing but the whole dream was just my hand in yours. And so yesterday's dream was kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200773\">like that but there was no touching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">(Pause): [00:13:20 00:13:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">THERAPIST: But very emotionally in it and -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">(Pause): [00:13:34 00:13:42]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">THERAPIST: Without boundaries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah.

We'd met earlier in the week and then you were supposed to e-mail me. Another time I think we had probably met on Monday and I hadn't heard from you the whole week and I was so, so like uncomfortable and I was really <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200951\">upset and I was I don't know, I remember talking a lot about it with Jeremy. 'Do you think Jay died? That's probably the only way he wouldn't have gotten in touch with me,' because I couldn't because like the other alternative was that you didn't care. Somehow I wasn't entertaining the alternative <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200952\">that you forgot. So that would mean, he doesn't care or he died.

So you called Friday night and left and I still have the voice mail you left this long, sweet, very apologetic voice mail and I was so happy. I was really giddy and relieved. But then I don't think I really paid that much attention to how happy to hearing from <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D1\">you made me feel and I sort of played it out, played it cool or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, you played a few things cool, back in those days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: I do it a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">(Pause): [00:17:14 00:17:23]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">CLIENT: I've done it a lot.
