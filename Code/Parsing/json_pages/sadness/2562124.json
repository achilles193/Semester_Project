I wasn\u2019t expecting the snow. It\u2019s supposed to be 55 tomorrow. Sorry, but I\u2019m still a little cold. Well the week went pretty fast I think, which was good because first week back. I still don\u2019t like my job. That didn\u2019t change in the course of a week. So it did make it difficult to work <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">because I\u2019m just so anti, I don\u2019t know. I did a bunch of work looking over resumes. I screened out a bunch of people and whatever. But all these were constantly just annoying me so I\u2019m just ignoring them, all these e-mails and request for rooms or whatever. So then today I\u2019m just going to have to answer <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">a bunch of e-mails. But that\u2019s what\u2019s annoying about it, though, because then today I\u2019ll answer all the e-mails and do all the work that I didn\u2019t do the last two days. But it\u2019s like if I can do it in one day I\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just kind of boring. I was trying to think of\u2026 whatever. [1:22] And on top of that I was going back and forth with Lucas all weekend\u2026 all week still. And then finally on Wednesday we met up for coffee near his house, in between his house and my work kind of, and chatted about stuff. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">I told him, basically, all about how at Aiden\u2019s party I thought he was acting like an asshole and all this stuff, and he was like I was feeling so sick and obviously I wasn\u2019t myself. And I was like yeah, I don\u2019t know who you were. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019ve been. You\u2019ve been an asshole. And he apologized <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">and said\u2026 and then of course told me that he\u2019s been thinking about me and, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m like\u2026 and that he feels bad that basically\u2026 I mean the same way I do, feels bad that we\u2026 I got into this situation. [2:28] And he feels bad and then of course, as usual, he begins reviewing all the reasons why <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200113\">we wouldn\u2019t work as a couple anyway. And I told him, as I always told him, I was like you don\u2019t need to say that stuff to me. I\u2019m happy with feeling glad about the reasons why we maybe could\u2019ve worked because if you start talking about\u2026 but yeah, we would\u2019ve fought all the time and look at this, we\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200114\">arguing now and whatever, then I guess, I don\u2019t know, it makes me feel more like less hopeful that I can make it work with somebody at all. And I like to think that all the things that did work are what I\u2019d like to focus on or whatever, and he basically needs to do the opposite. And he said\u2026 we were <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200115\">e-mailing at one point and he was like do I agree with you and poison my own mind more and disrespect my wife even more, or no. Anything I did\u2019s going to hurt your feelings but do I not play [ph?] it and then hurt myself. [3:50] And then\u2026 or do I agree with you and poison my mind and disrespect my wife <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200116\">further. Or\u2026 and then what do you want me to say, yes, I still want\u2026 but what am I supposed to do kind of thing. I was like you don\u2019t have to say anything; I am\u2026 this is how I feel about it, whatever. And then when we were saying goodbye, I\u2026 we\u2026 he gave me a big hug and I said I still love you, and <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200117\">he said I still love you too. And of course, I don\u2019t know, I think that he feels better about saying it because we can say it in a friend way, like as friends would say, as like I say I love you to my friends. But obviously it\u2019s meant much more in our case. So I\u2019m not sure what his motivation is in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200118\">even saying that back to me, or saying that to me. I\u2019m not sure. We talked about\u2026 I asked him about his relationship and how stuff is going and why he\u2019s been such a dick, basically, what\u2019s so whatever about the situation, and nothing. It\u2019s just\u2026 he basically was saying that he feels it\u2019s hard\u2026 he didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200119\">go into too much detail but he\u2019s like it\u2019s hard sometimes. And it\u2019s not like a whole day will go by and I\u2019m like whoa, this is so hard. But more like situations will get hard. But she\u2019s a fast learner and I\u2019m learning fast too, so whatever. That was his assessment. [5:36] But it was good to see him <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001110\">and talk about stuff. I think that that made me feel better, at least, that he apologized to me and stuff for being a dick, owns up to being an asshole kind of. I guess it does leave me feeling a little bit confused as to what why he would even say anything to me about, I don\u2019t know. What am I supposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001111\">to do with the information with him, that yes, that\u2019s confirmed that he\u2019s a... once\u2026 still has feelings for me or whatever. Or wants some flurtive relationship with me or some sort of something with me. Okay, but now that it is confirmed, what am I supposed to do with it. It\u2019s not like it changes anything. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001112\">[6:56] (pause) So I guess that colored my week a little bit. And then on Tuesday I went on a date with this friend of Jillian\u2019s boyfriend that he works with, and turns out he\u2019s 37, which I didn\u2019t know his age even. And he was nice and we had a nice time talking and having a few drinks and appetizers, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001113\">whatever, but I didn\u2019t feel\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just kind of like meh. It was fun. I\u2019m sure I could do it again. I just don\u2019t really feel\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20010-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20010-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562124\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20013\">THERAPIST: No sparks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. And then, whatever, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m just feeling kind of blah about the whole everything, the job, whatever. [8:15] (pause) And then I went out last night for a few drinks with some old friend, and then I got home a little bit tipsy, kind of like... I took\u2026 I was on <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200151\">the subway, whatever, so I took the subway home and got home, made some leftovers, whatever, was like kind of annoyed and was texting that guy and was saying\u2026 oh, and because this\u2026 the guy Frederick, that I had gone\u2026 that I used to work with, that I had gone out to dinner with a couple weeks ago and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200152\">then I thought maybe we could go out again, whatever, came for drinks or whatever, and doesn\u2019t seem to be interested or whatever. So I texted that guy and I was frustrated that\u2026 telling her how frustrated I was that nobody\u2019s asking me on a second date even, why doesn\u2019t\u2026 why am I the one initiating conversation. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200153\">[10:03] I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do, whatever. And then she said maybe your desperation is showing through. And I was like what are you talking about. My desperation is\u2026 she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about, and I felt really offended that she would jump to that. Like fuck you, you stupid <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200154\">whore. You\u2019re with a rebound dude. Talk about desperate, you found him at the fucking high school reunion. (pause) And then idiot Lucas telling me how much he regrets\u2026 that he feels bad about it and it was so bad and he feels so guilty and he wishes I hadn\u2019t blah, blah, blah, but I still want it. But <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200155\">that\u2019s him saying he still wants it. And I\u2019m like okay, what you\u2019re telling me are two separate things. You\u2019re telling me that you feel bad and you respect your wife and all this stuff, and you\u2019re saying but I\u2019d still like to\u2026 I still have these feelings. [11:49]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562124\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20017\">THERAPIST: I guess it seems clearest to me what you\u2019re saying about Lucas, that (pause) it\u2019s as though you kind of, I think, run around and look at the things he said from the angle that will make it feel the worst. I mean so first the problem was this, earlier this week that he was being sort of very <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200171\">flaky about actually being in touch, wanting to be in touch but not following through, basically. And so a couple of days later that sorts out, you guys get together. So in a way that\u2019s good. He\u2026 the biggest thing to me is the way that he\u2019s saying he still has feelings for you, which I think is kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200172\">of what you said you wanted to know. And in a way it seems\u2026 sort of fits better with how things felt to you. I have the sense that you sort of, in a way, have tried to think of it like\u2026 or convince yourself that he doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s sort of easier, and because he hasn\u2019t owned up to that, but that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200173\">given how things were between you over this last year it just doesn\u2019t make any sense that they would just go away like that because his wife was there. So in fact he\u2019s saying of course not. Yes of course they\u2019re still there. [13:51] And that he\u2019s in this very\u2026 that he doesn\u2019t know how the hell to handle <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200174\">this, it sounds like what he said. And he\u2019s sort of confused and not handling it well by you but whatever. In a way I could imagine that would seem like a relief, at least, to know. I mean it sort of makes things make at least some sense. And it\u2019s consistent with how you feel things to be. But you say <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200175\">it in a way it makes you feel worse, or at least it doesn\u2019t do anything for you because what are you supposed to do with it. So in a way you kind of just want to make it into bad news or frustrating news at least. There\u2019s no relief in it. And\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20019\">CLIENT: I mean a little, just to know that I\u2019m right, I was right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but\u2026 and then he says he loves you too, and that\u2019s a little different from sort of talking indirectly about still having feelings for you. He\u2019s kind of putting it out there and it\u2019s a sort of\u2026 it is; it\u2019s an intimate thing to say. And it\u2019s sort of showing how he feels torn. And that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B1\">just confusing and frustrating too. [15:42] So I mean there\u2019s\u2026 one of the things you said\u2026 but it seems to me a little like maybe you\u2019re sort of unconsciously moving around to look at things from an angle so that they don\u2019t help and don\u2019t provide any relief and just feel kind of frustrating or crummy. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2001B2\">I mean if you\u2026 I just want to have the sense that aside from him saying he doesn\u2019t want to leave his wife, what would you most want to hear him acknowledge and say to you. This would probably be pretty close, if not it. But somehow it provides no relief when it actually happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001D\">CLIENT: I think\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to look at it from an angle where it feels okay, provides any relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Well, (pause) I guess there are things there that I don\u2019t understand because part of how you were feeling so bad about this was feeling very much sort of used and discardable and not that worthwhile in a relationship. [17:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562124\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20021\">CLIENT: Well I still feel that way though. That\u2019s the issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20023\">THERAPIST: But, yeah, I guess that\u2019s sort of\u2026 I mean that\u2019s very important. I don\u2019t\u2026 it strikes me that he\u2019s saying that he has feelings for you and telling you that he loves you doesn\u2019t shift it a little bit away from, yeah, you\u2019re really not worth being with; I can just get over you in five minutes, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200231\">to something more like God, this situation\u2019s a bitch. Yes, I\u2019m married and I\u2019m going to stay with my wife, but she thinks in some ways things are really working between us, which is kind of what he\u2019s saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20025\">CLIENT: Right, but what am I supposed to do with that information? How is that supposed to make me feel any better? [18:51]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: Well you\u2019re saying part of why you were feeling bad is not just that you couldn\u2019t be together but that he should get over [overlapping talk]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Okay, well so it makes me feel a little bit better but other than that, what am I supposed to do with the information?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s part of what you\u2019ve been feeling. That\u2019s probably the essential thing you\u2019ve been feeling so awful about is nobody\u2019s going to want to be with you and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: But I still feel like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Right, and I guess it\u2019s\u2026 treats it like how he clearly feels very different, clearly that\u2019s not who you are to him. That doesn\u2019t make much difference. I mean in a way, to me, that situation seems like worlds apart, this situation which, yeah, he was just having fun and it was something else <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F1\">for you and you weren\u2019t that much for him and he got over you in five minutes and turns around and says oh yeah, it was nice, I should probably look out for you a little more but too bad and it doesn\u2019t matter to me really. And God, I\u2019m really torn apart, I still love you and yeah, [inaudible] of my <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F2\">life, but it\u2019s so difficult\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: Well I don\u2019t feel like he feels like that though. [20:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">THERAPIST: But that\u2019s what he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Not\u2026 but at the same time, though, he\u2019s still saying\u2026 I think he\u2019s just saying that he\u2019d like to still be able to have sex with me. Well I mean I know he\u2019s also saying that he still has feelings for me and still cares about me, obviously, but he wants his cake and eat it too. He wants to stay <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200351\">married and then be like but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t know. Tell you\u2026 he tells you he loves you, he tells you he still has feelings for you, it doesn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there, but I don\u2019t get the sense that he\u2019s trying to arrange things so the two of you can still have sex. I mean it sounds like it\u2019s more expressing his feelings <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200371\">and his being distraught.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Well yeah, I mean, that, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: I mean he\u2019s sort of also saying I\u2019m trying to think of reasons why we don\u2019t work because it helps me get past how I feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Which is actually an indication of how much he feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: But then why doesn\u2019t he just leave his\u2026 why doesn\u2019t he just tell her to move back to China then.

I mean you know that she\u2019s from a different culture and she\u2019s a different person and he fell in love with her, and they\u2019ve been apart for a year and the two of you have so much more in common and you spent all this time together and had good sexual chemistry <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">and got along well and all this other stuff. I mean\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20049\">CLIENT: But then why is he married to her, who doesn\u2019t have all that stuff? And who has whatever\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004B\">THERAPIST: But he\u2019s not saying they don\u2019t have any of that stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004D\">CLIENT: Right, so again, I just feel like what am I supposed to do with that information? Just proceed as I\u2019m doing, just continue dating and feeling nothing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I see. So you\u2019re saying that information doesn\u2019t actually give you anything to do that will make you feel any better. [23:12]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20053\">THERAPIST: So it\u2019s no help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20055\">CLIENT: It\u2019s like great, cool, there\u2019s somebody out there that I maybe can have a great relationship with and that loves me. Nice to know but I can\u2019t be with that person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20057\">THERAPIST: That and $1.99 will get you a cup of coffee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20059\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s probably $3.99 now, I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">CLIENT: Probably. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Well here\u2019s another possibility. Maybe it makes you way sadder to think about how things could\u2019ve worked with him than to feel that they didn\u2019t matter very much to him, which is what you felt a few weeks ago. [25:01] Or to feel like he\u2019s an asshole, which you\u2019ve also been feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">CLIENT: It\u2019s definitely way sadder to think that things could\u2019ve worked. I mean I do think that I feel like it\u2019s also... makes me feel hopeful that it could work with somebody else then too. But it\u2019s sad because it\u2019s not something that I can explore with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: And I suspect it\u2019s also just incredibly sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">CLIENT: Right. And how sad for him to be married and to feel\u2026 have feelings for another woman too. (pause) I mean [inaudible] sleep with all those girls; he didn\u2019t have feelings for them. It was just ego boosting. It was different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: [inaudible]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: Okay. Have a good weekend, yeah. Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
