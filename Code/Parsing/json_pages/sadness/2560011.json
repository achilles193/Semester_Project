[0:00:58] (Pause) Hopefully <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">nothing's changed in my major that I have to fix, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: A couple classes, and I should be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah, which will make the job hunt all that easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: And, if I get it all started and can take a July class, I could have my degree by September maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.

My major, and I picked up an accidental English minor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Wait, what was your major?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Theater.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Theater, yeah, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I picked up modern English slowly by accident.

[0:02:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, having a Bachelor of Fine Arts (inaudible at 0:03:00). Yeah, honestly you either want a degree in art or a degree in something technical. A degree in fine arts is just like, what are you doing? What are you doing with your life? I remember that was always the question between the fine <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200511\">art students and the regular art students. It's basically like, the fine art students, you just aren't very good. Art students, you are much better. So... of course they let art students always do some crazy stupid school shit. It's like, oh, 14 monitors on the wall, all of them a video camera of them <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200512\">looking at a boob. It's like, art. Yeah, sure. Fine with it. [0:03:52] It's fair that... to be fair anything falls under the definition of art. This is the first thing you establish in every creative course in college. What is art? Fucking anything. Anything you design with intent is art. Even the thing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200513\">you didn't design with intent could possibly fall under that category, so it's just kind of an umbrella term.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560011\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: Speaking of art, yesterday, I hit the pay wall on a tool set I was using. I just figured out some good stuff and was psyched, started doing some stuff. And then like, oh, too much. Your project's too big now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: Oh, huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:04:33) They're like, yeah, you can only make projects that are X big. I'm like, well, fuck. That's nowhere near big enough. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Is that right, they (crosstalk)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I had to switch sets. So (inaudible at 0:04:48).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: What was the...? What were they asking for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: $120. [0:05:00] But I looked at it, and I was like, well, that's expensive. And if I can ultimately... what I'd have to do eventually is take this and import it over to Unity anyway. So, since I already own Unity... I bought it four years ago for the company, an awesome $1000 program...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I was like, well, I might as well use this. And now it's got a visual scripting plug in. So (crosstalk)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Because that's why you use Unity to begin with, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. It's code, [the actual need] (ph) to write code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: And now I don't have to, which is nice...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: Which is real nice. So... but I spent yesterday looking at tutorials for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. How was that? Did you find it felt like it slowed you down? [0:05:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: It was good. I kept telling myself, it's like, you can do this. There are tutorials for this. You're smart, you can figure this out. There's no reason to let this stop you (pause), because I'd really been going for it, really been...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) But those obstacles run the risk of kind of making you... can they put an element of self-doubt in the picture?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20079\">CLIENT: Well, yeah. I don't want them to stop me. I don't want to get to a point where it's like, oh, now I can't progress on my own. Honestly, it's going to be unlikely that's going to happen now. The resources exist for me to learn. (Pause) So that's what I'm doing. That's what I'm doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B\">THERAPIST: How have you found doing the tutorials to be?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: It's good. A little confusing at first. [0:06:55] But once you've (inaudible at 0:06:58), you pick up the general idea. (Pause) So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: That's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">THERAPIST: I was thinking about... it reminds me of something we were talking about a bit ago, of... I think when very smart, gifted people run into confusion...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah, right. It's very upsetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20087\">THERAPIST: It's very upsetting. Happens to Columbia students all the time...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008B\">THERAPIST: That they get in sort of a panic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah, all of a sudden something isn't incredibly easy for you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2008F\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20091\">CLIENT: Now what do you do? Yeah. What indeed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20093\">THERAPIST: Yeah, we were kind of taught to think that confusion means somehow we're not getting it, whereas it's really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, like we're stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">CLIENT: It's like, this must be what regular people feel like all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">THERAPIST: (Laughing) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:07:57] There's a great moment in the show called Eureka. I don't know if you're familiar with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">THERAPIST: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">CLIENT: It's a sci fi show, it's really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Oh, I kind of remember it. 90s?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A5\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's kind of funny. There's a sheriff... no, it's even... maybe it started in the late 90s? Yeah, I think it started in the late 90s but continued. Good show.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N200A4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560011\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: It's about a town full of... a secret government town full of super geniuses working on amazing science projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AB\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AD\">CLIENT: And the main character is the sort of everyman sheriff. They establish in the pilot... because he gets an IQ test early on, that he's 100.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: He's like, yeah, 100!

And his daughter tests at like 160. And she's like, that's great, Dad, that's great. And she doesn't want to show him her score or anything. [0:08:56] She's like, yeah, 100, nice. So completely average, right in the middle of the... but just the whole idea. And it's like Star Trek in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B51\">there's always some... something has gone wrong with the science words, and [be able] (ph) to figure out what it is and solve it. Usually they're putting the sheriff in some sort of danger, putting him in a situation well above his head...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: But through stick-to-itiveness and teamwork and good-naturedness they always get through. And there's an episode where there's a stupefying ray. All the geniuses have been hit with a stupefying ray, so they're getting dumber and dumber. And he needs to figure it out on his own (chuckling). And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B91\">he's... as scientists have been getting dumber, one of them started prepping him with the stuff he needs to be able to do. [0:09:59] But he made a song so he can remember it. So he's singing a song which is all about particle accelerators and [how to do] (ph) this whole thing. It's funny. One of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B92\">scientists turns to him at one point, and they're like, oh God. He's like, what? He's like, this must be what you feel like all of the time.

I had one with the degree <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D1\">and one without. I'm like, which one did I even apply with? I don't know. And when my boss asked me at one point, he's like, did you go to college? I'm, yeah. He's like, did you finish? I'm like, yeah. He's like, okay, great, because apparently there was some question about, oh, did Fred finish his <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2014D2\">degree or not? And so they just asked me.

And... yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what...?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: I don't know. I just don't really care about the whole... what consoles are coming out and who's hot right now and the latest indie stuff. [0:25:01] I'm like, because most indie stuff sucks. Let's just be honest about it. It's like, we're all making video games. Yeah, but most of us probably <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A91\">shouldn't be. There we go. (Pause) So I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you feel that you haven't been as into the gaming...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AD\">CLIENT: I've been out of it for the majority of the last four years, you know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B1\">CLIENT: For the majority of the past four years I've been out of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B5\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201B9\">CLIENT: I didn't. I think about it all the time, about how eight months out of the past four years I've been at some other company other than my own. [0:25:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD\">CLIENT: I'm just like, if I had done this four years ago, I'd still have my own company probably. If I'd just done this four years ago. I would have just waited, taken my time, and then set up, then done it. I would have spent so much time making good game, instead of doing the stupid thing, which was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201BD1\">trying to make something that would sell instead of making something that you love, and hope that what you love is loved by others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause) Well, at the time it sounded like a reasonable idea (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, it did, and a lot of people told me it was. But people say a lot of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C3\">THERAPIST: It seemed to me like it was more like the kind of marketing piece of it that really (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C5\">CLIENT: Marketing (crosstalk) didn't exist. Yeah, [I didn't know how to approach it] (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201C9\">CLIENT: Which is why it's so great to have Pete to be like, here's the thing. [0:26:59] He's like, if you can make that thing, I can sell that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CB\">THERAPIST: And then what? (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. If I can make a thing, he can sell a thing. He's like, keep track of the money you're spending on this stuff, if you have to buy a license or something. He's like, because [it is money. So like, yeah, you'd better get paid for this] (ph). And there's a degree to which that would work. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D1\">CLIENT: Like, if [I did something with Kickstarter in a month] (ph), I'd be like, I need $10,000 to make a game. (Pause) I'll give him a few more months to work on it, on the people, unhindered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) Yeah, have you thought about doing that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of the plan, is to keep working on this until I get to the point where I can be like, this is a game. [0:27:58] Who wants to see the rest of this game?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D7\">THERAPIST: You want to be able to show them something, you've got to get to a certain point first (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Right, that's going to be a lot more compelling than an idea, just an idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201DA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201DA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560011\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201DF\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E1\">CLIENT: To be like, look. Here's the thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E5\">CLIENT: And (pause) yeah, [lots of stuff I could do] (ph). (Pause) And one of the great things is that, there's totally a community for the tool set I'm using right now. But the community for the tools that I was using is really active and strong. And I realized I can still use them for the logic of <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E51\">things, because both of them use (inaudible at -0:28:55). [0:28:58] And so I can go to the one place and be like, hey, I'm trying to do this thing, and how do I do this? And they'll explain it to me in terms of the tools that I was using. But I should then be able to translate that all over [to the <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201E52\">tools] (ph) I'm using now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E7\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201E9\">CLIENT: So that's handy. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EB\">THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, there's that extra step now you've got to (inaudible at 0:29:19). Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201ED\">CLIENT: So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, it's an obstacle course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F3\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F5\">CLIENT: It's craziness, just craziness. But if I can make progress I can be like, this is a thing. This is a real thing. It's like, if I can get some classes, get the degree, get the game going... if I could spend the next couple months just building stuff and taking classes, that'd be great. [0:30:07] <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F51\">That would be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F7\">THERAPIST: That would be great. And the other thing I was thinking about is that, for you, I think... I see it with a lot of people that are very creative, is that... and if you get impassioned by something, is that the biggest obstacle are these little... when practical shit just happens and gets thrown <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201F71\">up in your way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201F9\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FB\">THERAPIST: It can be maddening. It can be really disheartening. It threatens the dream. It threatens the kind of the idea. And it's like, that's where those ideas sort of die, is when those... these practical bullshit stuff... like, shit happening, comes up. It's hard to maintain. [0:30:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FD\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201FF\">THERAPIST: It's your biggest obstacle by far. I mean, it's not your idea (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20201\">CLIENT: Oh, it's true. Yeah. No, the idea works, and all the other stuff is just... right now it's just where do I get my income from? Or how do I get some money to come in?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20203\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20205\">CLIENT: And I don't know the answer to that question. So... (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20207\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20209\">CLIENT: I need to hook up with some consulting gigs. I keep forgetting that I can do that, I can call that consulting, kind of be like, hey, I can talk about stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020D\">CLIENT: See what people have to say. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F\">THERAPIST: I've got to say in fact... I know this is a lot of advice, but I was thinking it would be a... in terms of what you were doing, what you've been doing at those other jobs, it seemed to me like you were interested in consulting. [0:32:01] You didn't want to get involved in all the bullshit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2020F1\">You had done enough of that work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20211\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, I just want to be like, here's a thing I could do. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20213\">THERAPIST: I think it's a reasonable way to talk about when... one thing I know that you're worried about is, how are people going to look at these... the leaving these jobs. And I think it's... your story, which is accurate, is you came in because you wanted to do a certain piece of work. You told <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N202131\">them... you even told them that, [that's how we're structured] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20215\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20214-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20214-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560011\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20217\">THERAPIST: And it seemed like the company was the same way. Maybe you would have... it wasn't as clearly delineated as, hey, I'm just going to come in as a consultant. But it seemed to me like that's what you wanted to do. And once...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20219\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it's like, let's just set it up and go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2021D\">CLIENT: And yeah, I mean, there's people out there right now doing my job and not doing as well as I could, and getting paid for it.

And so there's a whole range. But they're all employed. They don't... there's no movement, not like any of them are leaving their jobs. And I just don't know... (Pause) I just don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20223\">THERAPIST: Hmm.

Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022B\">THERAPIST: And I think you also manage people very well. [0:33:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2022C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2022D\">CLIENT: Yeah, but (pause) nobody wants that right now. (Pause) What could I have accomplished in four years? What could I have accomplished in four years? (Pause) It's not quite four years. It'll be four years in September. I just... (Pause) I don't know. What could I have accomplished in four years? <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2022D1\">Well, whatever. What do I accomplish in the next couple months? [0:34:55] Right? What do I accomplish in the next couple months? That's what I should be looking at.

(Pause) Still, I just got to get in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20237\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess what I mean by saying that, though, is that you've got a hell of a lot... you've got a hell of a burden you carry with you, man. It's what we've been talking about here, the anxiety and the bipolar. [0:36:00] It's not a fucking...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20239\">CLIENT: No, it's ridiculous. And what the fuck am I supposed to do? (Pause) What the fuck am I supposed to do?

Well, we'll see. We shall see. Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, I don't know, dude. I just don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2023F\">THERAPIST: I mean, I've seen real change in how much anxiety you can kind of tolerate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20241\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20243\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I can get lots of free art, I suppose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, what stage are you...? Where do you find yourself at right now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027D\">CLIENT: How do you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2027E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2027F\">THERAPIST: With the game, with the program?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20280\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20281\">CLIENT: Like I said, the thought is there, the design is there, the beginnings of the design are there, the basic mechanic of the game, what makes the game fun, what makes it interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20282\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20283\">THERAPIST: That's there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20284\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20285\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's all there. Now it's just a matter of making that work in code. And that's just time. That's all it is. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20286\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20287\">THERAPIST: (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20288\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20289\">CLIENT: It's possible, it's feelable (ph), it's understandable, it's something I can do, because you make it visual and all of a sudden it's like it's perfect. [0:40:54] I just need the logic of coding, which I can do. The logic of coding is not that difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028B\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028D\">CLIENT: Like in the previous system their custom movement stuff was very strange. And they're very good at like, control this like you control a car, control this like you control... and move this to wherever the mouse pointer is, and... but, if it was like, I need to move this from point A to point <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2028D1\">B exactly, they had a hard time with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2028E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2028F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20290\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20291\">CLIENT: So I'm like, okay, move from here to here. Like, all right, and it would start moving in that direction and wouldn't figure out how to stop them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20292\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20293\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20294\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20295\">CLIENT: So I had to be very carefully coding things. I had this thing where you've got a good guy picture here and a bad guy picture here. And when you say, attack this, I had animation where the [big guy] (ph) rushes, hits him, and flips back to his space. And that should be easy. And that should be <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202951\">easier in Unity...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20296\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20297\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20298\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20299\">CLIENT: Because we'll move this to here and then move it along... it's like, here you are, here this is. Draw a path from there to there. Move along the path, and reverse yourself back along the path, and there you are. [0:41:57] And I should be able to move the actual bit (ph) himself, whereas in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202991\">last one I wouldn't move him.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N20298-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20298-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560011\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029B\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029D\">CLIENT: I would create a copy of him... well, something that looked like him, but it was actually a bullet (ph). I would turn him invisible while shooting that bullet at the other guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029E\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029F\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A1\">CLIENT: When it got to the other guy it would destroy itself. But first it would fire a copy of itself back towards the original guy. When it comes back and collides with the invisible guy, it destroys itself and he comes back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A3\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A5\">CLIENT: And so it gives the appearance of, he rushes out there and does this thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A7\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A9\">CLIENT: In fact it's three separate objects in two states.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202AA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AB\">THERAPIST: So Unity makes it easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202AC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AD\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk) Yeah, I actually move him. Instead of making something that looks like him and firing it and sending another one back (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202AE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202AF\">THERAPIST: Oh, I get it. And you'll have three extra steps in the other one, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B1\">CLIENT: Right, so it's like you're here...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B3\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B5\">CLIENT: And the other one has to figure out how to get here, go over there and come back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B7\">THERAPIST: But the reason you didn't go Unity at the beginning was because you had to do that all in math? [0:42:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, and you code it out. And you're like... you figure out [how to approach the angle, how to return the angle] (ph). And now it's just... visual coding, they're like, find a path between X and Y. Great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BB\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BD\">CLIENT: Great, there you go, find the path. So they do a lot of math stuff for you. They'll... it's a game development kit. It's like here's... and you can create your own stuff if you can code. You can...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202BE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202BF\">THERAPIST: So it gives you that option to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C1\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it's... the tool I'm using in Unity, the plug-in, is made exactly for me. It's for artists and designers to make games on their own without needing a programmer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C3\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C5\">CLIENT: And really it helps to have done programming, which I've done. And the thing about... I've done enough programming where the logic is easy. I know how to do these things. I can work... if the objects I need aren't there, I can find ways to work around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C7\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Like how you figured out how to do the move (crosstalk). [0:43:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202C9\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And it's just (inaudible at 0:43:59) stuff. And so (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CB\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. It's like constantly problem solving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CD\">CLIENT: Yeah, which is great. Like, this is a function which runs the combat. I couldn't pass enough arguments to it where it made sense so they could do it. So instead what I'd do is, I'm like, here's the combat function, and here's an array...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202CF\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D1\">CLIENT: Where I haven't even labeled anything except on a piece of paper, to know array index zero is what I'm using for physical damage. And number seven is what I'm using for total damage delivered. And so there's none of that. And so then whenever I have anything involving combat, [it's just like] <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202D11\">(ph), oh, I'm starting combat. Great, take all your various values, and write them to these indexes (sp?)... indices in the array.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D3\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D5\">CLIENT: And it's like, and I'm going to target all your stuff, the indices, combat, take them out of the array, do the math, and then tell the target what happens, in fact don't even that. [0:44:55] Just tell the array, and the target will ask the array what's happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N202D4-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202D4-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560011\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D7\">THERAPIST: But you work around that whole problem of the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202D8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202D9\">CLIENT: Yeah, the whole thing. It's great. If you can't talk to each other, everyone talk to this. It's like an intermediary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DB\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DD\">CLIENT: Essentially, I'm going to throw a pie at this person. Great, what kind of pie are you trying to throw? If someone throws a pie at you, what's likely to happen? Okay, then put all that in the bucket, there you go. Here's what came out of it. Deal with it. Then hit by a pie? Okay, you feel better? <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202DD1\">So yeah, I can do all that stuff. The syntax has always been a problem, but now it's just how to set up [the logic states] (ph). (inaudible at 0:45:41) are fucking brilliant. And again they sound really aggressive, I think. And when you actually make one, it's like, oh, I's pretty simple. A light switch <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202DD2\">is a good example of (inaudible at 0:45:54), which simplifies [data stream] (ph). [0:45:56] It has two states in existence, which is on-off. And there's a trigger that transitions between those two states [on a statement tree] (ph)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DF\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E1\">CLIENT: Whereas with a larger one... let's say you mark it with total maximum number of players that could exist. And you're like, yeah, it could exist in any number of player turns and also in another turn state, which is not assigned to a player, which I can use for other events. So basically I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202E11\">like, there's this thing. Let's say there's six people, there's six total possible players who can be involved in any scene. I'd be like, okay, start game, current player equals one. And then on the guy I want for player one, he has a listener event. It's like, am I...? Does my turn order number match <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202E12\">the current player number? Oh, good. [0:46:55] If that's the case, I'm going to start doing these other things. I'm going to make myself ready to get access, I'm going to... it's like, now that I'm in this state and other events are being clicked on, if I'm clicked on and it's my turn, you do the following <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202E13\">things (pause), which is great, because then at the end of that you're like, okay. After you've done all your stuff, after you've gone through those things, now I want you to do the... [I want] (ph) you talk to the next FSM, the next [final state] (ph) machine, which is called the next player machine. <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202E14\">And what it does very simply is it looks at the current player number, which should be from one to six, and it's like, if that is six or greater, it's one now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E3\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E5\">CLIENT: Otherwise, add a one to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E7\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E9\">CLIENT: It's very simple, then you know whose turn it is. It's just like [chk chk] (sp?).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EB\">THERAPIST: But you've got to do all the... yeah, that's something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202ED\">CLIENT: Yeah, but that's the... and that's its entire purpose. It can probably also be like, okay, and clear the data in these various arrays to make sure it's all clean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202EE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202EF\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah. [0:47:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202F0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F1\">CLIENT: And that's what... there are so many great parts to that. It's like, okay, where am I telling it to do things, and what have I told it to do? And again the thing they tell new programmers all the time, it's like, computers are fucking stupid. They do exactly what you tell them to do and nothing more...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N202F0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202F0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560011\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F2\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F3\">THERAPIST: (Laughing) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F4\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F5\">CLIENT: Exactly what you tell them to do. And it's like, it's not working. No, it's working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F6\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F7\">THERAPIST: It's working (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202F8\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202F9\">CLIENT: It's working. You just built it wrong. So let's figure out where you built it wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FA\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FC\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FD\">CLIENT: That stuff is interesting to think about and think about ahead, and be like, okay. I'm going to tell this object all these things. And I'm always going to tell it before combat, but not everything will get overwritten. This thing isn't necessarily going to overwrite other values. So at the end <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202FD1\">of every phase let's make sure we clear everything out...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N202FE\"><span data-id=\"P13-N202FF\">THERAPIST: Oh man, wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20300\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20301\">CLIENT: So every time you start up again it's new and fresh. And those are simple things that (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20302\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20303\">THERAPIST: Yeah, but you liked... you've got the kind of the heart and the mind for it. [0:48:59]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20304\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20305\">CLIENT: Yeah, and I can picture it. And now that it's all visual, it's just like, whee!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20306\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20307\">THERAPIST: Okay, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20308\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20309\">CLIENT: I don't have to be like, okay, what is it...? Okay, so this is... okay, how many public variables should this have? Is this function public or private? I'm like, I don't fucking know. I pretty much would be like, okay, so it's...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030D\">CLIENT: What's the function called here? It doesn't matter. Make a function. It's like... you say, what do I need you to do? Just build it. Take the pieces, and put them together. Now it does that. And there's arrows, and you can just bend the arrows. And you make these energies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2030E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2030F\">THERAPIST: Oh, that's cool, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20310\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20311\">CLIENT: Here's a state. Here's another state. Link them in the following way. Here's how to transition from one to the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20312\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20313\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20314\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20315\">CLIENT: And it's really cool stuff. And it's... yeah, it's all just logic and stuff I understand really well. So the good news is ... and that 's what I like about it, it's all stuff I understand really well. Now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do it. [0:49:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20316\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20317\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20318\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20319\">CLIENT: And it's visual syntax, which is so much easier...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2031A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2031B\">THERAPIST: Than actually writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2031C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2031D\">CLIENT: Well, yeah, just remembering. For me it's always been like, what's the...? Okay, wait, so how do I say that word again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2031E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2031F\">THERAPIST: Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20320\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20321\">CLIENT: It's like, what do I call it when I want to do this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20322\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20323\">THERAPIST: Okay. (Crosstalk)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20324\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20325\">CLIENT: And what's the order I put things in? Where does the period go? And...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20326\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20327\">THERAPIST: It's literally another language, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20328\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20329\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And... which is funny, because I'm so good at languages. And again, when I was taking comp sci classes, I was good at comp sci classes. It's like... I must have told you, I stopped going to comp sci classes pretty early in the semester. They're 8 AM classes. I never intended to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2032A\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2032B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2032C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2032D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I never intended to go. And Ginny didn't understand it. She's like, why are you...? I'm like, listen, this is a project and test class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2032E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2032F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20330\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20331\">CLIENT: It's like, I'm going to ace this. This is...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20332\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20333\">THERAPIST: And you did, right? It wasn't hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20334\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20335\">CLIENT: Yeah, and it wasn't hard. And Ginny really struggled with it.
