(pause) (sigh) I still haven\u2019t gotten the car fixed, which is mostly fine, except like both this week and last week, I\u2019ve forgotten to tell Monica that we haven\u2019t gotten the car fixed, until like the night before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">So it\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, by the way.\u201d And the thing there isn\u2019t like \u2013 I can either take the subway or the bus, and both of them go pretty fast. But if I take the subway, Monica will usually drive down in the car; get the kids in the car, to like switch off with me, so that she doesn\u2019t actually ride the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">bus to get down there; it\u2019s like a mile or two away from the house. And I take the bus; it doesn\u2019t get there by 9; it\u2019s like 9:15. [0:01:17] (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">Just feeling I have my shit together. (pause) I still haven\u2019t gotten my tax forms to James, or like figured out all the places that I\u2019ve been tutoring this year. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that hard, because I think everywhere is with like \u2013 had been with a company or another, so that I should have <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">the W2 forms.

(pause) (sigh) [0:05:00] (pause) It\u2019s kind of like walking through mud, and that\u2019s exactly right, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">because it\u2019s just like my whole body, and then it\u2019s like when I\u2019m thinking, that\u2019s like trying to walk through mud too.

(laughter) Yeah. (pause) [0:06:00]-[0:07:00] (pause) (sigh) I read on Facebook last night that someone tracked down one of [] camps in the desert. And like, there\u2019re broken gen bottles, and car parts, and the campfire and everything. There\u2019 talking about it as just this like huge find <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">for contemporary archaeology, and a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">I just sort of thought, man that\u2019s sort of a shitty way to treat your camping place.

I think he\u2019s pretty shaken up, and sort of, (Austin)\u2019s (ph) is not really a city that\u2019s easy on bikes; it\u2019s not really designed for it. All of us would be on him; it\u2019s like, Papa\u2019s just so bad. The peripheral vision is such like he just doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">pay attention to the things around him, like I\u2019m afraid to cross the street with him.

It seems like in this case, it was clearly like the woman who hit him\u2019s fault, because she was looking for a cell phone, and just came around the corner, and bam. (pause) It\u2019s weird; so Papa\u2019s like commuting on a bike, which is the most dangerous thing that you can do pretty much anywhere in America.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">Amanda is like an increasingly high level river, like white water kayaker, which the way she sort of was talking about it, as a matter of fact, they said, \u201cYeah, everyone who\u2019s like a class 5; class 4 or 5 kayaker has a really big life insurance policy.\u201d It\u2019s just like it\u2019s really hazardous; people <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D1\">die (inaudible at 0:11:35).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">Jason\u2019s like wilderness adventuring, which is probably the safest of any of it. (pause) I don\u2019t know, I feel like I should be more worried about this; worried about people. But like, I\u2019m most worried about Papa; Amanda I sort of say, \u201cWell, you know, you know those are the risks that you\u2019re taking, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">and you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s worth it.\u201d And I\u2019d much rather that she\u2019d do that than want to do it and not do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">Papa, I\u2019m not sure he does know what the risks are. (pause) [0:12:45] (pause) I guess what I\u2019m thinking is, it\u2019s a little weird to be like the safe stay-at-home person, but to feel like I\u2019m sort of in daily contemplation of my own mortality. (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. (pause) (chuckle) The (inaudible at 0:13:22) that comes to mind is like, \u201cWell Amanda\u2019s taking up white water kayaking, but I\u2019m really the one with the death wish. (laughter) (pause) That feels so a little melodramatic to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: Mm?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: That feels so melodramatic to me. (pause) [0:14:34] (pause) I was talking with a couple of friends from church at this party, and one of them is a \u2013 she\u2019s like an (inaudible at 0:15:39) professor, I want to say. And the other is \u2013 he was like a practicing psychologist for awhile, now he works <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">for the church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I don\u2019t know how we got on the topic, but so we were talking about like mental illness, specifically within the academics setting. I was doing the least amount of talking, which tells you something about my friends. (laughter) I like them. And so Lionel, who\u2019s the psychologist said, \u201cWell, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">when somebody\u2019s suicidal, they\u2019re terrified; it\u2019s like they don\u2019t actually want to die. I\u2019m sort of like, \u201cI\u2019m going to really disagree with you there.\u201d And then I stopped; it\u2019s like, you know what, this is going to get too real for a party. [0:16:38] (laughter)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">I guess what was surprising to me was that like I would have felt very comfortable continuing to talk about it; it was more like, I\u2019m going to regret this in the morning. (laughter) I was a little drunk. Or I had been drinking. (pause) (inaudible at 0:17:12) (pause) (inaudible at 0:17:23). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">It\u2019s so weird, it\u2019s like (sigh) for one ten-minute period to another, it feels like I will die if I keep feeling like this any longer. (crying) But I don\u2019t; it just keeps going, and you know, this isn\u2019t a new feeling, so I know that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Like I know that it just keeps feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">like this, and that eventually I sort of wake up and notice that (inaudible at 0:18:43) wasn\u2019t so bad, but I can\u2019t ever \u2013 like I can\u2019t tell where that came from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">When it does get easier, I can\u2019t always tell where it is, and it is (chuckle) really convincing. So like, but like this is going to kill me, that I can\u2019t do this, but I have to.

(chuckle) Yeah. (pause) [0:19:50] (pause) I just go through my day, like you know, there\u2019s part of me that thinks like, well, I\u2019ll get up and get dressed. But I\u2019ll be dead before I get to work. Or I\u2019ll go to work, but I\u2019ll be dead before I get home.

(pause) (sigh) Yeah, I think that\u2019s right.

[0:25:47]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">But I expect that most the time, you don\u2019t connect those things with how awful you\u2019re feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">CLIENT: Mm-mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">THERAPIST: I mean you come in and sort of talk about ways you feel flaky or not together. I wonder if that\u2019s in part a reference. You know, you may not be together; there\u2019s like these things you\u2019re really upset about, that you feel kind of distant, you know a bit distant from. And you just feel the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">upset, and then feel kind of shapeless, and (inaudible at 0:26:22) and unbearable. Then, you\u2019re probably thinking about death, and not anticipating you\u2019ll live through the next few minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">I wonder if that\u2019s also like (pause) partly a comment on how you don\u2019t feel like you can bear to think about some of the things that are so painful and upsetting. I mean with good reason, if they\u2019re really painful and upsetting, I\u2019m not saying you should be able to, I\u2019m just saying, I wonder if some <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">of, you know, in the last few minutes, your thoughts about, maybe they\u2019re not in your thoughts, but dying and not being able to bear the next few minutes are in part for feeling closer to things; particular things that are so unbearably painful. [0:27:46]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I tend to find it difficult to recall from week to week what we talk about in couples counseling.

You know, I feel like after the point of couples counseling for me, it felt like I don\u2019t want to talk about this stuff; I don\u2019t want to think about it, and I won\u2019t on my own. So it\u2019s kind of thrown back in there.

(pause) Yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 0:31:39) At one point, talking to Dr. (inaudible at 0:31:46), and she\u2019s being pretty (confident,) (ph) and us saying like, well I want to have kids eventually, and like we\u2019re really far away from that.

(pause) [0:34:26] (pause) So, I think the problem of understanding this is like, the situation that you\u2019re in, anticipating losing (inaudible at 0:34:52), and feeling like you\u2019re going to make it happen, or you\u2019re not going to be able to stop it happening, and you\u2019re just going to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F1\">watch it happen; kind of pass away I guess, like that\u2019s sort of one of the most harrowing situations you can imagine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Right now anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">CLIENT: (laughter) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: I guess another aspect of it is, it seems almost predetermined and at the same time, in a way it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. Like clearly it makes emotional sense, and feels very much like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And there are some ways that like \u2013 there are some reasons in the world <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">that you can think of, that would cause that. [0:36:21]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">But I guess my impression is, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s entirely about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: It doesn\u2019t seem like it adds up; yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: But it feels inevitable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

You feel out of commission, and not clear why; but you do, I\u2019m not doubting it, it\u2019s just \u2013 [0:37:18]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. And you know, it\u2019s like when James has said the things like I think about leaving sometimes. It\u2019s like I sort of think about I always knew this would happen. (pause) Yeah. It\u2019s like the exact expected worst today.
