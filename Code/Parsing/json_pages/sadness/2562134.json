So, but I was feeling pretty ready to go back to work because I just got kind of bored and like cabin fever with this snow, storms, and stuff. And I have a really, really busy month because between Martin Luther King <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">day and then going away at the end of the month for my birthday, I\u2019m only in the office seventeen days, which is really not a lot. And I have a lot to do in terms of like (inaudible at 00:00:48) is leaving on the thirty-first of this month, and I\u2019m gone starting on the thirtieth, so I won\u2019t even be <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">here on her last day. But I just, I had a lot to do so I was kind of feeling like this is good, like maybe the month will fly by, and you know, whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">I, and you know, I had started the new year feeling like, \u201cOkay, like it\u2019s finally the year\u2019s over, like feeling better,\u201d whatever, like feeling hopeful and like feeling about the new year, and then thinking, \u201cOh, I could just be busy at work\u201d or whatever, but like as soon as I got there and started <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">like seeing all these resumes again, and like the same requests and the same fucking professors and the same person asking about a hotel reservation for April. Like, and just, the resumes, I\u2019m just thinking that like I\u2019m doing this again, and like looking through these same people and these horrible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">cover letters and whatever, and just start to feel really frustrated about that and just still stuck. And I guess I was like anticipating coming back and like just feeling okay about it or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Or just feeling better about it, and the vacation was good. I think, you know, it was a little bit difficult because just a lot of alone time, and Stephanie (sp) went away on the twenty-eighth, so I didn\u2019t really get to see her and, you know, Christmas was nice with my mom, but low-key. I saw my brother, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">went to Dim sum on Christmas Day and it was nice, but again low-key, and a lot of alone time. You know, if I wanted to have a plan, I had to make my own plan and I get it, but you know, just, I wish I didn\u2019t always have to be the one doing that. And like I had several back and forths with Lucas, where <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">basically like he just keeps, it\u2019s the same thing as before the vacation, though, I spoke about, I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">Just that he keeps kind of saying he wants to talk or like \u201cOh yeah, we need to talk,\u201d or whatever, like acting like he wants, or whatever. But then like it never happens and then, you know, and it\u2019s fine, so I just kind of adjusted and like, \u201cOkay, this is what it\u2019s going to be like.\u201d I\u2019m trying to <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">move on, and I\u2019m kind of whatever, and then, but I said like, \u201cStay safe in the snowstorm,\u201d or something like that on Thursday, and he was like, \u201cOh, I just got onto a (inaudible at 00:03:27),\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cHappy New Year, whatever.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">And he was like, \u201cYo, we need to talk ASAP,\u201d and I was like, \u201cOkay,\u201d and I was like, \u201cDid I do something?\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo, just about the error of my ways and how they, and how it involves you.\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay,\u201d like whatever, like \u201cLet me know when you want to talk.\u201d So then he specifically <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">texts me yesterday morning to say, \u201cCan you meet either tonight or tomorrow night to talk about friendship and whatever?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20014-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20014-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562134\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">Everything, and I was like, \u201cYes, what time, and where would we, should we meet?\u201d And he never replied, and never replied the whole day, never replied until finally at seven I was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m actually not feeling well, so never mind anyway, even though you never whatever.\u201d And then he never replies, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">never replies, so I texted him this morning, and I was like, \u201cYo, I mean like should I be worried that you\u2019re dead or something? Like I don\u2019t understand who doesn\u2019t like what the fuck, you know?\u201d And he replies, \u201cHi, sorry.\u201d And so I call him and like was screaming at him on the phone like seven o\u2019clock <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200172\">in the morning, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you think you are, like it\u2019s so rude what you just did last night.\u201d No, I was, he was like, \u201cSorry,\u201d like he was just saying sorry, I was kind of like reaming him. And I said, \u201cCan you answer my question about why you didn\u2019t call me? Why you didn\u2019t tell me a time <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200173\">or cancel or anything? What\u2019s the reason?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">\u201cI turned off my phone because my friends were sending too many group texts and I guess I forgot to turn it back on.\u201d I was like, \u201cYou asked me if I could meet up. Like do you know how rude and selfish and just lacking manners, like your behavior is right now? Not only have you been a dick to me the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200191\">past month, but you\u2019re now just treating me with, like zero respect. Like I don\u2019t even, it wasn\u2019t even in your fucking\u2014\u201d I don\u2019t care if he was getting his fucking dick sucked all night by his wife, like you make a plan with somebody, you fucking text somebody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">So then he, I yelled at him and he was like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, and you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right one hundred percent, and I have so much to say on this and this is what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d like when I said, \u201cYou\u2019re treating me like shit, like you have been treating me like shit, you\u2019re selfish, you\u2019re being <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">selfish, like whatever.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">So then he like, we\u2019re supposed to meet because then there was maybe like museum stuff that I didn\u2019t quite get, and he wanted my help, and I was like, \u201cFine, whatever.\u201d And it turned into like this whole, basically this, you know, I don\u2019t even care to read it specifically to you, but basically it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D1\">just, he feels guilty, he doesn\u2019t want to feel guilty, he feels bad, he used me and discarded me and used me as a stand-in and even if it was my own fault for, like, letting myself fall in love with him or something like ridiculous like that, you know, that it\u2019s his, that it was selfish on his part <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D2\">because he let it continue. And, you know, he doesn\u2019t want to feel anything, he doesn\u2019t want to feel bad, he doesn\u2019t want to think about me, and he doesn\u2019t, and I said, and I replied, and I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t help you with how you feel.\u201d Like, and he basically then wrote me later and like, \u201cYour call <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D3\">this morning,\u201d oh no, that\u2019s what it was, he wrote me, \u201cYour call this morning put me on the wrong side of the bed, and I\u2019ve already taken it out on my wife and my dad so this is not what this e-mail\u2019s about, but you really, you know, put me in a bad mood.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">And I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I put you on the wrong side of the bed because your behavior didn\u2019t affect my day yesterday or today or any of the other days at all this month.\u201d And then I was like, \u201cNot. Do you understand?\u201d And then he wrote back and said, \u201cYes, I know it was me, it\u2019s me, like it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">not a good day and we\u2019re done talking for the day.\u201d And all, and this all happened like right, like in the hour before I came into the session. And all I could think is just like why do I keep getting involved with these people that are like so selfish? They just think they could just treat me however, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">like do I, am I letting them? Like I don\u2019t, like even to tell me like, even to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s me, we\u2019re done talking for today,\u201d is still like being an asshole because that\u2019s basically like, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you are feeling about this conversation or this interaction we had today, I\u2019m done, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">so we\u2019re done, even though I\u2019m sorry, like I\u2019m telling you we\u2019re done, like so don\u2019t.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562134\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">You know, so then it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, so he can be mad at me like if I continue it or something,\u201d or, you know what I mean? Or just won\u2019t respond to me, like he\u2019s done, he\u2019s done talking about it for today. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m busy, I\u2019m busy.\u201d I was like, \u201cFuck you, you\u2019re busy, like what are you talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">about?\u201d Like, but just like the\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">THERAPIST: What were you doing (inaudible at 00:08:40) what he\u2019s saying about feeling at fault.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">CLIENT: Right. He, all he\u2019s doing is making me feel more and more insignificant, or as if like the only reason he wants me to think, or I don\u2019t know, my only significance is because he wants to somehow reconcile his feelings of guilt about the whole thing. But it doesn\u2019t feel like that has anything <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">to do with me at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20027\">It\u2019s just him. He, it\u2019s eating at him, and so he needs me to somehow, he even wrote, \u201cPlease help me help you.\u201d Like what does that even mean? Like I just really didn\u2019t want to like feel like bad in 2014 or something, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20029\">Like I wanted to feel better about my job and my living situation, and like my social life and whatever, and I don\u2019t. Like I still hate my job and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">I just don\u2019t really know what to do with myself, and I feel like at this stage I should, I should. And like it\u2019s frustrating that I, that I feel like I don\u2019t. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">(Long pause continues) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: It seems to me the, what\u2019s happening with, you know, the year 2014 and you, is those things, kind of those things are similar. The issue with Lucas, I think, where you\u2019ve been really upset about what\u2019s been happening with him, I guess especially over the last month, and have felt any number <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F1\">of terrible things based on what\u2019s happened and what\u2019s true with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">Like disappointed, and screwed over, and let down, and abandoned and treated disrespectfully. And telling it to happen when you feel so upset and bad like that where you kind of want to just put it away, which is a problem, because then the next time it comes up, you sort of hope it will go different, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">although you kind of know better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">Like you get in a bit of denial about how it\u2019s likely to go, I think. I mean, he\u2019s been pulling stuff like that, this sounds like a somewhat worse example, but all month, hasn\u2019t he? Or like you\u2019re job. I mean, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t mean to sound harsh, but the idea that the turn of the calendar page was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200331\">going to make you better about the job, it seems a little magical to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20032-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20032-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562134\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">CLIENT: Well yeah, I don\u2019t know why I felt that, I would change my own, like I thought that by thinking that way like I could change my attitude about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">THERAPIST: So what I\u2019m saying is, I think you\u2019ve been so upset about it and felt so awful about it so many times for so long, like you can\u2019t stay on that page, and you have to imagine it\u2019s going to be a new page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">CLIENT: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">THERAPIST: The problem is, it is actually the same job, and so like with Lucas, when you go in and the same shit happens, it\u2019s usually disappointing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F\">THERAPIST: And I think with me, it\u2019s a little more subtle, but I think there\u2019s a similar process that happens where you come in kind of hoping I\u2019ll say something and, you know, in a way, if you step back and it\u2019s not the craziest thing in the world, that will make you feel better. But the things you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003F1\">talking about aren\u2019t the sort of things where if you look at it a little different, or you try to approach it a little different, it\u2019s a different situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20041\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20043\">THERAPIST: Like you hate a lot about your job for a long time, you know? And things with Lucas have been shitty for a long time, not a long time, but you know. That\u2019s been really hard, the stuff with him, clearly. And you know, so I think you, you know, of course you\u2019re sad and feeling kind of confused <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200431\">and unsure what to do, and are hoping I\u2019ll say something that will help you feel better, but what I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s the same thing. We kind of know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20045\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know, I know. Well I even had the thought, like as I was waiting to come in here, like I don\u2019t even know where to start, like there\u2019s no point in me, you know, talking today, because like there\u2019s nothing that I\u2019m feeling bad about is anything, like you said, you could just, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200451\">like if you change, you know, think about it this way, or you know, approach it this way, and that will help.

It\u2019s like you, it\u2019s like you have a, you sort of put your hope in the other person or some other thing like you are, because I think, I think because you can\u2019t quite maintain it in yourself, and then when you were about to come in, you, it\u2019s like that way of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200471\">approaching this is where it\u2019s been. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20049\">I\u2019m not agreeing with you that there\u2019s no point in talking about stuff, but if the goal is that I\u2019m going to say something that\u2019s going to make you feel happy about things you don\u2019t feel happy about\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s where I\u2019m going, I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">THERAPIST: And there\u2019s also something going on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">But I don\u2019t have my head as much around those, where, I mean like in the moment between you and me, I think you probably feel like I\u2019m hurting you. I mean, I think if you step back for a minute, I know you don\u2019t think I\u2019m being an asshole or I\u2019m saying things just to make you feel bad, but I think in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">some very immediate way, it probably goes like purple and shitty to hear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: To hear what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: What I\u2019m saying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: No. More like no, I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">Maybe annoying, because not because you\u2019re annoying, but because like I just feel like I\u2019ve been saying the same things for two years and nothing has changed, you know? It\u2019s just like yeah, I know that I do that, that I like put, you know, it will be a new year so I\u2019ll feel differently about it. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">like thinking about trying to find a new job and is just way more overwhelming, I guess. To think about how I could like make this situation better, but it has been shitty for a long time and I have gone through it for a long time. And I feel like I can\u2019t even like say any of this stuff to my friends <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B2\">anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562134\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D\">Because it\u2019s like, \u201cGreat, how long are you going to like, I don\u2019t know, not date or not go and make friends,\u201d like I don\u2019t know. Stephanie\u2019s (sp) all like back from vacation like her and Aiden are all in love and shit, and she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m really happy right now, so I can\u2019t have negativity, so if you\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2005D1\">negative, then I can\u2019t hang out with you until you\u2019re not negative.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2005F\">It\u2019s like I\u2019m sick of feeling shitty about stuff and I\u2019m sick of having to fake shit and I like wanted the whole theme of like my 2014 to be like wellness and like doing stuff and social, and whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20061\">And like I don\u2019t feel well. Like, or like happy or motivated or any of those things, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20063\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess also part of this is that I think, I actually do think that this is (inaudible at 00:24:17), but I think you do often feel like other people don\u2019t want to hear about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20065\">Yes, things actually really suck. If you\u2019re feeling hopeless and shitty, that you know, you\u2019re going to get what you\u2019ve gotten recently from Stephanie (sp) and also from Lucas. You\u2019re upset, we don\u2019t want to hear about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">CLIENT: Aiden did it too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">THERAPIST: And (inaudible at 00:25:06) with me, but I think there\u2019s probably some of that there as well. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because you, oh I can\u2019t actually (inaudible at 00:25:26). Yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy to talk about how like you talk about bad things that happen, and as you were talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200691\">about earlier with Lucas over the weekend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">But it seems like it\u2019s more worrisome for you to talk about really how bad things have been. What happens when the job sucks? You know, feeling upset about it, and really down about it, frustrated by your job and also the process, at times, of trying to find another one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: I sort of have the feeling, actually, when I think about it, you don\u2019t necessarily imagine I will want to hear about how bad some of that stuff is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: No. I sometimes feel like, I don\u2019t know, like I don\u2019t know how you can help me, like I don\u2019t know. Like I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to help, like I, like figuring out why I choose the wrong men, like I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to be focusing on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">Like in therapy, and in my daily life in terms of like changes I can make that will make it so that I don\u2019t feel this way later maybe about similar situations, I guess. Or, that I don\u2019t get involved with somebody with these men that are kind of really selfish and self-serving, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">THERAPIST: Okay, so now I think we\u2019re talking about sort of two different dynamics, the one with the men you get involved with, you\u2019re describing that as selfish. I think you\u2019d say that they really let you down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">I think they\u2019re also charming, and it seems as though that like sort of meshes right in with your like why doesn\u2019t it make you feel better, why am I depending on he\u2019ll be there for you this time. You know, like there\u2019s a sort of collusion around that, and then a disappointment. And to me that\u2019s different. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">I don\u2019t think you would say that I do that so much. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m not sort of being helpful or (inaudible at 00:29:57) or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562134\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20079\">And so it\u2019s like, what\u2019s the point in the first place? Like how is what we talk about or what I have to say actually going to really do anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007D\">THERAPIST: But (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2007F\">(Long pause continues) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20081\">(Long pause continues) Well, I guess I\u2019m a little concerned is why I keep defending myself is not what I\u2019m intending to do, but it occurs to me that I guess it shows like how strongly you believe that the way we\u2019re talking about things won\u2019t help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20083\">That like you know, you\u2019ve been wondering what draws you to these kind of guys and you know, I was just saying some stuff about it, and some of it\u2019s new and some of it\u2019s not new, but I think we both agree that probably actually accounts for a lot, or at least I think so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20085\">CLIENT: What do you mean, counts for a lot?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20087\">THERAPIST: Well, accounts for a lot of how, why you\u2019re drawn to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008B\">THERAPIST: And yet somehow, our clarifying that, or am I saying that? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008D\">Doesn\u2019t actually feel like the feeling you have is not like you\u2019re getting, like you\u2019re getting anything or I\u2019m giving you anything useful or of value that could help. Again, my point isn\u2019t to sort of make an argument that I am, what I\u2019m interested in is like your experience as we\u2019re talking about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F\">CLIENT: Well I think because it\u2019s like, I will hear you say things or we\u2019ll say things and I\u2019ll be like, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s a good point.\u201d But okay, so how do I change it then is I think what I always end up feeling. Like so how do I make sure that doesn\u2019t happen anymore? Not be attracted to charming guys? <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2008F1\">Only date guys that are really unattractive physically because maybe that means they\u2019re a better person or something?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s absolutely what I\u2019d recommend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Right, you know what I mean? Like I-<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: I actually think it is clear, from what I\u2019m saying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">Not exactly what to do out in the world, but what\u2019s driving all of this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Which is ways that you\u2019re feeling shitty about yourself or things in your life that you want so much to look away from, that you, you know, pin your hopes on things that won\u2019t work. The problem with these guys isn\u2019t that they\u2019re charming, nothing wrong with charming. But the problem is, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B1\">let you down, and you like, again and again and again, and you let yourself get caught up in that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">Because you can\u2019t bear to know what you really know about them or about what you want them to protect you from or take you away from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009F\">CLIENT: But then, it\u2019s like so then how am I ever going to find somebody who will stay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A1\">THERAPIST: So I mean, even as you\u2019re talking, I think you\u2019re doing kind of the same thing. Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding, but you\u2019re saying like, \u201cLook, what strategy do I use then?\u201d It\u2019s sort of like what you want from me are like ways to look at it or steps you can take to prevent this from happening again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200A2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562134\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Although, in a repeat of what we\u2019re talking about, you know I, you know A, that I\u2019m not going to give you that, and B, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t believe it exists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200A7\">CLIENT: Right.
