Is there a good place to start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Well, it turned out Josh had spiked a fever and gotten an infection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Which is sort of what I was, was what my worst fear... So last week was pretty terrible. (LAUGHTER) It got under control. But then they ended up doing a bunch more tests which found some fluid near his heart that could have been detected. And it\u2019s just sort of typical surgical swelling type <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">thing that\u2019s not good, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Right. I mean, that\u2019s one of the fears with surgery is infection after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Well, and the (inaudible at 00:00:39) infection. So anyway, they did another surgery to put drains in to get rid of it. And then the drains got clotted up and gross and they had to take them out. And then they decided that the pacemaker could also be a source of infection or it just was not <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">good to have in there if his blood was infected which it was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">To take that out... So they took that out yesterday. So he\u2019s just been in a lot of pain. He\u2019s really frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Of course. And he feels like crap because of the high fever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Luckily, they got that under control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: Oh, they did? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: They just pumped him full of antibiotics. And, you know, it\u2019s been hard for me to be at school at the right time to get answers. So I\u2019m like trying to piece together what happened. But I had one nurse who told me that his heart fluid was infected and I thought the surgeon had said that that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">was the worst case scenario. I couldn\u2019t get anyone to tell me for sure. (LAUGHTER) And I\u2019m still not sure if it was infected. I think the final answer is that it wasn\u2019t. (PAUSE) Anyhow...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">THERAPIST: That must be so frustrating not being able to have a clear picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">CLIENT: Well, I still don\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure they do. But, you know, I told one attending that the nurse had told me that this is infected his pericardial (ph) space which I still don\u2019t understand exactly what that it. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Given that you\u2019re not a cardiothoracic surgeon. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: Right. And then he seemed offended that I had the wrong story because it wasn\u2019t his fault. I don\u2019t know. So... (PAUSE) Yeah. It\u2019s just all... It\u2019s all a mess. And I got pretty concerned about school. I was in a panic, I would say, about school last week because I started getting a lot more e-mails. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">Things were really getting going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: The semester is really started now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">CLIENT: And I had owed my advisor something for weeks and I finally sent it to him. And (PAUSE) it turned out to potentially... Well, it wasn\u2019t... It didn\u2019t... It wasn\u2019t crap. But I didn\u2019t know that for a few days and he was really concerned it was crap. And he was also really concerned that I didn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">have time to put into it because I have so much personal issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">THERAPIST: He was concerned it was crap having not read it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:55).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: ...or looked at it? Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: The (inaudible) looked wrong given all of the other stuff we have been doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Luckily, it turned out to not be wrong. But it very well could have been. So anyway, that was pretty... You know, I had pushed it, pulled it together really fast because I only had an hour between running around or... (LAUGHTER) So he asked somebody to help me and step in like to do some <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">of the stuff I needed to be doing. But I was like, \u201cThis can\u2019t continue.\u201d And then Josh got scheduled for this other surgery on Friday. And then the surgery turned out to be... Actually, he was scheduled on Thursday and they didn\u2019t let him eat or drink all day waiting for his spot to open up. It never <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200372\">opened up. So I ended up staying overnight at my friend\u2019s house who happened to live nearby until they could fit him the next day. It was like the most miserable day. And Friday was the most miserable day too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20036-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20036-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561827\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You\u2019ve had a lot of miserable days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (SIGH) (PAUSE) What was I saying? Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: That you were concerned about school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Yeah. So... I had talked to a couple of people about it. I didn\u2019t really know what to do. I was pretty sure I was going to have to do something drastic at this point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Meaning take a leave? (inaudible at 00:04:05)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yes. So my friends were having a wine tasting party on Friday night. So after Josh got out of surgery on Friday and I saw him and everything was fine, I went home and took a shower and went to this wine tasting party where I got really drunk and my friend, and had like a mental breakdown all <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200431\">night at this party, where my friend and I hatched a plan, a drunken plan for what I was going (LAUGHTER) to tell my advisor which, the next day, actually still seemed like a good idea. Which was to ask him... Because my fear was if I asked for a leave of absence, I would just be totally removed from <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200432\">school and never go back. And also I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t give my friends more credit before. They\u2019ve been really good. They\u2019ve seen Josh in pretty gross states. They\u2019ve been reading his website with updates that we post that are often pretty depressing, listening to me every day, taking on my work. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200433\">I mean, I should\u2019ve given them more credit before, thinking that they couldn\u2019t handle stuff. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s times like this I think where you sort of really do find out exactly who\u2019s there and how much they\u2019re there. And it\u2019s nice...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: They\u2019re there a lot. They\u2019re really, really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s nice for you to be pleasantly surprised that these, this group you have is really supportive and they really care about you and Josh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: And to take a leave of absence would be (inaudible at 00:05:29) which would be really, not leave that but leave it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d have less access to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah. And one of my friends who went to undergrad at (inaudible) couldn\u2019t find any grad policies that said anything like that. But I was, worked myself up into a pretty big panic about it all weekend. So what I wanted was to ask my advisor if I could just not be paid basically and do whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">work I wanted to do or could do so that I didn\u2019t... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: But still be enrolled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Because things are progressing that if, like on certain projects that we\u2019re working on, that if I dropped out, someone else would have to take them (inaudible at 00:06:11). And I don\u2019t want to sit at the hospital all day or sit at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: But I can\u2019t be at school twenty four seven either. So that was my hope and this was the drunken plan my friend and I hatched or my friend convinced me on Friday night and it sounded so good. But I was really afraid it was not going to work out or he wasn\u2019t going to be okay with that or whatever. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200571\">So yesterday, I went and talked to him about it which was good because I was having dreams about it. It was basically (inaudible). I woke up having dreams about it. I was just panicked. Like... (LAUGHTER) So I made an appointment with him on Monday afternoon because if I didn\u2019t talk to him, I was going to just...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20056-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20056-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561827\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: You felt like you were going to explode?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: ...explode. You know, who knows when Josh would have another surgery or what...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">CLIENT: So it turned out that he doesn\u2019t care. He says he doesn\u2019t care how much work I do as long as it\u2019s just this semester. You know, if this is a crazy crisis for another... He says as long as I want to work, I can do whatever I can do. And actually, I should...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">THERAPIST: And be paid or not be paid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">CLIENT: And be paid. Yeah. He says he was planning money. He doesn\u2019t care with money. Which was shocking. I was really shocked. And this is also coming after... The first time I saw him after winter break because he was away, he said, \u201cIf you can work 70, 80% (inaudible at 00:07:37) no problem. (inaudible).\u201d <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200631\">And I had bumped into him right after I saw you last. (PAUSE) And I had barely been doing anything, like 5%. So I had been in a panic, a small panic since then trying to figure out how I was going to work 70, 80%...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: Right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: ...which led to all the rest of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">THERAPIST: Right. And he doesn\u2019t really mean that. I mean, it sounds like this number, as long as you\u2019re wanting to do something and do what you can, it sounds like he\u2019s fine. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">CLIENT: Yeah and... (PAUSE) I mean, yesterday was a great day. (LAUGHTER) I feel really, really lucky that that\u2019s okay with him. (PAUSE) But then there\u2019s today where... So Josh is in excruciating pain. Yesterday, I went to visit him after being at school most of the day. So I had to wait and he just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B1\">had a pacemaker cut out of him. And the pain drugs weren\u2019t doing anything and the doctor kept coming around to try to talk about how he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get addicted and let\u2019s try some other pain drug. And it didn\u2019t do anything. And I called him this morning to see how he was and he was basically <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B2\">in (inaudible at 00:08:49). He hadn\u2019t slept all night because he was in such pain. (PAUSE) He really wanted him to come bring him macaroni and cheese as soon as possible. I told him I couldn\u2019t and he got really upset. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">(PAUSE) So I guess that brings me... I don\u2019t know what is going on or how I feel or anything. It\u2019s just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really day to day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:09:09) (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) But at least school... I\u2019m still not down from the panic from the past week or two over talking to my advisor because I still have to somehow make it work but... And I\u2019ve been in such a panic. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: It sounds like you really need to take it day by day. And it sounds like the message that you got from your advisor is that, you know, he\u2019s not worried about the money. He\u2019s not really worried about how much you produce this semester. He\u2019s hoping that it\u2019s limited to this semester. And you <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200731\">don\u2019t... You have no way of predicting what it\u2019s going to look like a month from now, what it\u2019s going to look like tomorrow.

I mean, even this morning, I was still in a panic over whether I should rush over and bring Josh macaroni and cheese, if it was right of him to like demand macaroni and cheese when, you know, I really need to go to school all day or if I should be feeling so bad that he\u2019s basically got <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200751\">ten million open wounds all over him and all he wants is some macaroni and cheese and is that so terrible? (LAUGHTER) Like, I just... I don\u2019t know what\u2019s right or wrong or anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">THERAPIST: Well, there\u2019s a difference between what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t think there is a right or wrong. You know? Is it wrong of him to want macaroni and cheese when you need to go to school?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">THERAPIST: No. It\u2019s perfectly understandable. He wants whatever small comfort he can have because there\u2019s so much that\u2019s uncontrollable and extremely uncomfortable. Does that mean that you have to make it possible? No. I mean, there are... Maybe there are days that you can run over with whatever meal <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">request he wants. There may be days when you can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And then there maybe days that you can\u2019t. As much as it\u2019s fair for him to ask, it\u2019s also not fair for you to not have to meet every need because you simply can\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: I mean, I know it\u2019s also not just about macaroni and cheese.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: I know he didn\u2019t sleep all night because he was in, what he calls a twelve out of ten pain and no one seems to be...

They were having trouble with the pain management then too. He just wasn\u2019t getting relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t even remember.

(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean, he was in so much pain last night. He was like in tears, could barely talk because it hurt. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: That must be really hard to see. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: It is. And there\u2019s nothing I can do. And he\u2019s trying really hard to be nice to me. But I know he really just wants to scream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">THERAPIST: Right. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got, you know, about this much frustration tolerance. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah. Anytime I couldn\u2019t bring him macaroni and cheese, he was like... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, he\u2019s got nothing left to manage those emotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. And then the last time I was sitting there, he was trying to like relax and then someone came to take his blood and he was... And then someone came to take his temperature and somebody came into check his VAD (ph) things and it was like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Give him a break.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. And he started like just like crying so he couldn\u2019t take it. (SIGH) I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) Yeah. I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) I decided today that I will go there because if I don\u2019t I will just go to school and think about what is going on. So I\u2019m going to go bring him macaroni and cheese and <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A11\">hope that it will be the right decision. I\u2019m going to try to come back later and get into a class later today. I hope it all works out.

If you, you know, try to do this and it\u2019s not working and you can\u2019t keep up with school, then it\u2019s not, you know, it\u2019s a decision you can change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.

If you took a leave of absence, you can\u2019t change that until the end of the semester. I mean, you... But it sounds like your advisor has given you a lot of flexibility so you can continue to be paid and do as much as you can. And I think you need to be honest with <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF1\">yourself and kind of continually reassess, \u201cCan I still do this.\u201d And if at some point you can\u2019t, then you can take a leave then or you can ask to not be, you know, be taken off the roster then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">THERAPIST: But this is a decision that can easily be undone, right, because you\u2019re not making a change right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.

I\u2019ve been able to use them because my parents are so terrified of me dropping out of school that I was talking about being the hospital a lot last week for surgery... Like I basically waited there for two days for surgery that kept getting pushed off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">You know, my dad... He was really concerned about school and this was before I talked to my advisor so I was pretty worked up about what I was going to say.

(LAUGHTER) So I ended up, my poor dad, just snapping at him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s hard to feel that pressure from your parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: I basically did what Josh does to me when he\u2019s in so much pain. I did that to my dad. And I felt really... I still feel really guilty about it. I wasn\u2019t that mean.

How did he respond? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: He just didn\u2019t really say anything. He kind of... I mean, he backed off. (PAUSE) But I also scared my parents to death because Josh really wants to talk to a lawyer about this electro physiologist (ph) and maybe that\u2019s not a reasonable thing to do. I mean, it (inaudible at 00:16:25). But he <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">asked me to call them and see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Educate me a little bit.

I\u2019m sure he would have, his heart would\u2019ve continued to get worse given what they told us (inaudible at 00:17:11) or not...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Right, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">CLIENT: Whatever.

I don\u2019t know. He just really wants some validation...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">CLIENT: ...about whether what happened was right or wrong or... I\u2019m sure he should just talk to somebody who knows something about it.

And... I don\u2019t know. It made me feel so bad that I had even done that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">THERAPIST: You felt bad that you had called?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">THERAPIST: Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">CLIENT: He seemed to be saying like, \u201cYou should just be in the hospital helping him get better. You don\u2019t need a lawyer right now.\u201d He said that a couple times. (LAUGHTER) And I felt so terrible about that. And then I can\u2019t even talk to Josh right now. I haven\u2019t been able to talk to him probably since <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F71\">last week because the procedures and the pain and stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting that you feel badly about it because you were... You contacted the lawyer because it\u2019s something that Josh was interested in doing. You were doing that for him. That was, is one of your ways of supporting him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: Well, and for me too.

Also a lot of really tough days have been followed by my friends taking me out getting lots and lots of drinks usually which has been really helpful lately <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201172\">which is surprising because it\u2019s not something that is something I want to do for a long time (PAUSE) whether it\u2019s good or bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">It seems good.

(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014D\">THERAPIST: They might not be planning that far in advance or that many steps down the road. Right? I mean, it\u2019s... (PAUSE) He\u2019s got to recover from these surgeries now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F\">CLIENT: Yeah and I still... I still don\u2019t know what the state of the infection is. I think I\u2019ve had a different story from every person I asked and no one seems to think... I mean, they tell you good and bad news kind of in the same way. It\u2019s hard to even tell a good or bad thing (inaudible) tell you <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2014F1\">sometimes. (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I waited for his surgeon pretty much all weekend. He was supposed to come by and (inaudible) other people to save. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20151\">He\u2019s one of the few people who will actually talk to you like a, not like an equal, but kind of. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20153\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to get face time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20155\">CLIENT: Which is perfectly understandable. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">THERAPIST: Right. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) But frustrating because an important piece of care is knowing, having someone that can explain to you kind of what is the status right now and what is the expected next step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">CLIENT: And I still worry about Josh all the time and he\u2019s in too much pain to speak up or (PAUSE) notice that and listen to him for a couple of minutes to find out, oh, he does really need more drugs or has anyone checked the (inaudible at 00:25:51) in the past day. I don\u2019t know. (LAUGHTER) Maybe they <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201591\">do check on all this stuff but it sometimes doesn\u2019t seem like it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">THERAPIST: You know, I was... I think one of the fears is that with so many different care givers that things can get lost and fall through the cracks and somebody else thinks that somebody\u2019s paid attention to this piece. It puts a lot of pressure on you to try to hold together all the different pieces <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B1\">and make sure that none of that stuff gets missed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">CLIENT: Well, and even stuff like they don\u2019t seem to... I mean, people just don\u2019t know him either. Like if they leave his pumps uncovered because they\u2019re trying to teach someone how to like look at the flesh to see if blood is pumping, he\u2019s in like a lot of pain. It\u2019s not all positioned properly. No <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D1\">one asks him that. Maybe one nurse will know. I don\u2019t know. Like information isn\u2019t always passed along about like personal things or like just comfort things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s got a white board in his room. You know, like hospital rooms have a white board.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">CLIENT: He does actually. So like somebody... I was thinking about that yesterday because I watched some nurses teach another nurse and it was really... (PAUSE) I could tell he was in a lot of pain. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">But they were like trying to switch machines around and they were pretty stressed. It was pretty uncomfortable (inaudible at 00:27:11).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So little things that like wouldn\u2019t be in the chart but make a difference to his comfort level, things like his pumps need to be arranged just so or it creates a lot of extra discomfort, those are things that you can put on the white board.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20164-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20164-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561827\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20167\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20169\">THERAPIST: Or if you know other things... Because that\u2019s the kind of thing that will make a difference in the quality of his day but probably isn\u2019t going in his chart because it\u2019s not a, you know, it\u2019s not a medical note like, \u201cI have him his morphine drip at ten AM.\u201d You know, they write down that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201691\">They might write down how much urine output he\u2019s having. But they\u2019re not going to write down that he\u2019s much more comfortable if he\u2019s got three pillows under his head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016B\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016D\">THERAPIST: And that\u2019s the thing that you can put up on the white board and they might notice. You know, you can kind of train nurses like to look there so there\u2019s some continuity about that kind of stuff when you\u2019re not there to do it for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2016F\">CLIENT: Yeah because I feel like every time I go to school for a full day and show up at night, there\u2019s something that makes me so sad I wasn\u2019t there all day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20171\">THERAPIST: And you... I mean, and you can\u2019t. You just can\u2019t be there all day. Even if you\u2019re spending all day in the hospital, you have to get up and go get something to eat. (LAUGHTER) You have to go take a walk. I mean, you can\u2019t be there all the time. But if... You know, if you can find a way to <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201711\">leave some notes for people about things that you would do or that you know would make a small difference in his day, maybe you\u2019ll feel a little bit better and maybe it\u2019ll help with communication of these kinds of things that just don\u2019t make it into charts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20173\">CLIENT: That\u2019s so hard too. This is something I don\u2019t know what\u2019s right or wrong. He is in so much pain. He waits for... He asks the nurses when his pain drugs are due and he like watches the clock waiting for them to come and if they\u2019re like a couple minutes late, he starts to freak out. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201731\">they\u2019re running around taking care of other people. But it\u2019s really hard to sit there and not be able to like just go the pills. I see they\u2019re right there but I can\u2019t give them to him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20175\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: It\u2019s just... (PAUSE) You know, I can\u2019t be like, \u201cCan you please be on time to the second for his pain drugs? Just watch the clock,\u201d when they\u2019re trying to save somebody else next door. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: Well... So but you don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. You can say, \u201cHe really waits and it watching the clock and it\u2019s a lot of discomfort if there\u2019s a delay in getting his meds on time.\u201d You can let them know that because there are other patients for who maybe on that floor, it doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201791\">matter so much if there\u2019s a five minute delay. You know, maybe they\u2019re saving somebody\u2019s life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: Well...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">THERAPIST: And if that\u2019s the case (LAUGHTER) then his pain meds wait. But, you know, maybe they\u2019re also just not watching the clock and just, you know, are five minutes behind or ten minutes behind for something because, you know, they didn\u2019t realize it made a big difference. So there\u2019s a way to be <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D1\">able to say, \u201cYou know, it makes a big difference to him because he\u2019s in a lot, he\u2019s continually in a lot of pain and he\u2019s like counting the seconds until he can have his next dose.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">If they know that, there may be some times when that delay can be avoided.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">CLIENT: I guess I can put that on the white board too.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P9-N20180-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20180-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":10,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561827\" data-realpage=\"10\" data-page=\"10\">\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20183\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

When you\u2019re there, you can repeat yourself and just phrasing things in a way that let them know what he needs in a nonbullying way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2018D\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I mean, you can tell the nurses are so stressed out and I don\u2019t want to inadvertently upset, not upset them, but... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re just very tense with their interactions like everyday sometimes. (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know.

(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20191\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, some of them seem like they\u2019re in such a rush and trying to pester them with questions, they seem pretty like not (PAUSE) able to... They\u2019re just like not able to sit and talk to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20193\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20195\">CLIENT: They\u2019re just constantly running around. There was one woman who got worked up because there was some other patient being rushed over from the ICU and needed a transfer like a fourth patient. I don\u2019t know. Like they need more nurses. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20197\">THERAPIST: You feel like they\u2019re understaffed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20199\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) (inaudible at 00:32:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019B\">THERAPIST: Is there anyone... I mean, now that he\u2019s been there for a while, is there anyone that you have a better relationship with or you know a particular nurse that comes onto rotation that you feel better or able to talk to? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2019D\">CLIENT: Oh definitely. But they work three shifts a week and there\u2019s a fourteen week... Is that right?

I can get school under control and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A5\">CLIENT: ...the hospital\u2019s a disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, there\u2019s too much to be able to manage everything right now. So this is kind of the balancing act of how much can you have things under control in one place. And it\u2019s not under your control. What happens at the hospital is so much out of your control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, things were at the worst for my mental state this past weekend, I guess. I felt terrible. (PAUSE) And I fixed that quickly, you know, I think. So I was happy about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AD\">CLIENT: So big crisis averted at the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201AF\">THERAPIST: How many times a day are you sitting down and taking ten deep slow breaths? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B1\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I did go to yoga class on Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B5\">CLIENT: And I was really worked up this weekend. So I would say it took the edge off. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Which I think is all that we\u2019re going to expect right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201B9\">CLIENT: But it was not much of an edge off a very (inaudible at 00:33:51).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Very high cliff. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BD\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BF\">THERAPIST: I think that\u2019s... I think right now, I think finding ways to take the edge off is probably the realistic expectation. You\u2019re not going to likely get to a real Zen space. But if you can find your way to a yoga class, great, maybe it\u2019ll take the edge off. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P10-N201BE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"9\"><span data-id=\"P10-N201BE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":11,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561827\" data-realpage=\"11\" data-page=\"11\">\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C1\">In lieu of that, or in addition to that, I think finding some spaces during the day where you stop, find a chair, sit down and close your eyes and really do ten deep breaths where you count in two, three, four and hold for two, three, four and then exhale for two, three, four. And if you count them <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C11\">out like that and make yourself inhale, hold, and exhale, you will slow down your breathing. And maybe that will help take the edge off the hurricane feeling. Like if you can do that before you enter the room... Like walk down the hallway, stand outside his room... Maybe do four breaths because I know <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C12\">you\u2019re not going to stop and do ten. (LAUGHTER) But just to slow yourself down and to give yourself a little bit of the... It may not work... It might slow you down mentally which would be great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C5\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s definitely, if you can do that, even if you do four of those counted breaths, it will slow your heart rate down a little bit and it will force you to take longer, slower, deeper breaths, maybe take your blood pressure down which will just make a little bit of a difference in how you <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C51\">feel. If you can stop and do that at a couple points during the day, rather than escalating all day long, you\u2019ll at least kind of maybe hold it back a little bit. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C7\">CLIENT: Yeah. And I have been running which is the opposite of that. But it helps. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201C9\">THERAPIST: Well... Yeah. It\u2019s not really the opposite. It works in a different way. You know, while you run, I mean, yeah, you\u2019re breathing heavier because you\u2019re running but you\u2019re releasing all sorts of tension. You are relaxing your muscles because you\u2019re getting nice and warmed up and then the coming <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N201C91\">down off of running, your blood pressure lowers. As your heart rate comes down from the high place where it was running, it gets lower than what it was before. I mean, exercise works beautifully to decrease your stress anxiety. We know that that\u2019s been, you know, kind of a good practice for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CB\">So if you can find a way to sneak in a run, even if it\u2019s a short one, you probably will feel some calm after you run or calmer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CD\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) Right. (inaudible at 00:36:17) it\u2019s not even I have to sneak it in. It\u2019s like more important...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201CF\">THERAPIST: To do that. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D1\">CLIENT: ...than going to school. Yesterday, I went for a run after I went to the lawyer because it was either I was going to sit on the couch and cry for an hour, which I was pretty close to doing, or I was going to go running.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Right. Running is probably a better choice. It probably felt better. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D5\">CLIENT: Unfortunately, like on last Friday night, instead of running in the middle of the night...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D7\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201D9\">CLIENT: ...I ended up drinking all night. But for some reason that was also really good too. It seems to be helping lately. Running and alcohol. (LAUGHTER) Maybe I can try the deep breaths. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DB\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not going to judge you for drinking. You know, it\u2019s probably a useful anxiety relief at this point. You do want to limit it of course just because it\u2019s got some side effects that the other two don\u2019t have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DD\">You know, alcohol... One of the things about alcohol is because sometimes you can, as it leaves your system, you can sometimes have a rebound anxiety effect and I don\u2019t want... You don\u2019t need any extra.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P11-N201DC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"10\"><span data-id=\"P11-N201DC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":12,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561827\" data-realpage=\"12\" data-page=\"12\">\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201DF\">CLIENT: Oh yeah. I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E1\">THERAPIST: So, you know, use alcohol in moderation safely with your friends. But mix in some of these other techniques too just so that you can have other things that you use effectively and you don\u2019t have to worry about whether or not you\u2019re going to feel crappy hung-over or get an anxiety rebound <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N201E11\">effect or interrupt your sleep which sometimes alcohol can interrupt your sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E3\">CLIENT: It always does. It always usually causes me extra anxiety in the middle of the night and I stay up late and it\u2019s like the calming effect has been so worth it which is not usually the case. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E5\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So keep... You know, just keep your wits about you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E7\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201E9\">THERAPIST: See if you can add in some deep breaths because I think it will help. And one kind of presentation that Josh is picking up on is that you\u2019re coming into the room like a hurricane which doesn\u2019t feel good for you or maybe give you a little bit of relief or at least keep things from escalating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EB\">CLIENT: Right now I kind of feel like (inaudible at 00:38:21)...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201ED\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201EF\">CLIENT: ...lay at the end. There also was in this class a woman who I went to her elementary school teacher. There was an elementary school teacher in this class I visited happened to be in the class. That didn\u2019t help either with my like being calm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F1\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F3\">CLIENT: Like we have to lay at the end...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F5\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F7\">CLIENT: Like I almost was like twitching. I was just... I couldn\u2019t even focus on breathing because...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201F9\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FB\">CLIENT: ...I just had to try and focus on laying there and basically (inaudible).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. That was really hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N201FF\">CLIENT: So I go through the whole deep breaths things... That might be something... What would you do before you took deep breaths? I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20201\">THERAPIST: Well, so limit it. Right? So if you can only stand... If you can only stand to sit for one measured breath of counting, then do one. And you think the hard part about that end pose in yoga... And I spent years in grad school laying thinking, \u201cI have like a lot of stuff to do right now that <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202011\">would be much more useful than laying here for ten minutes while I breathe.\u201d Those were the thoughts that were going through my head. And a really high stress point for you right now... Laying there for ten minutes might be, feel more harmful than helpful. So that\u2019s why doing it on your own... Maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202012\">it would have been physically helpful to do one or two breath cycles and maybe that\u2019s all you could\u2019ve handled right then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20202\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20203\">CLIENT: Well, I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is the laying there is so hard. (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20204\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20205\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s way too hard. It\u2019s way too hard right now. It\u2019s way too different from where you are to get... Right? I think what\u2019s helpful usually is when you have like one degree of stretch from where you are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20206\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20207\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know what that is though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20208\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20209\">THERAPIST: I think it could be sitting in a chair. You\u2019re doing it now. And counting out one measured breath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020A\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020B\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:40:15) (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020C\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020D\">THERAPIST: That might be it. See what that\u2019s like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N2020E\"><span data-id=\"P12-N2020F\">CLIENT: This is like when I sat in the hospital room sitting with a visitor, feeling like this and I picked my entire manicure off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N20210\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20211\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) Maybe it\u2019s pacing. You know, like... There\u2019s walking meditations where you kind of just pace up and down the hallway and count your steps. And the counting of the steps is kind of what keeps you from being in that loop in your head that\u2019s making it, you know, that you think <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202111\">whatever anxious thoughts that you\u2019re thinking. Forcing yourself to kind of count and walk down the hallway twenty steps and walk back the hallway twenty steps and doing that a few times. It might be helpful for you to move and have a kind of maybe a walking meditation or...<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P12-N20210-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"11\"><span data-id=\"P12-N20210-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":13,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561827\" data-realpage=\"13\" data-page=\"13\">\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20212\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20213\">CLIENT: That sounds better than... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20214\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20215\">THERAPIST: Yeah. So alright. Let\u2019s do that. Try that. And that\u2019s... You know, it\u2019s official. They\u2019re called walking meditations. So it\u2019s not like you\u2019re making something up. And give yourself something to focus on whether it\u2019s counting the steps or some other, a phrase that you go to recite like, \u201cThis <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202151\">walking is going to help me.\u201d Something that you can focus on so that you\u2019re not thinking in your head, \u201cI would rather just go in and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d (LAUGHTER) But give yourself something specific that you\u2019re going to say in your head and maybe do, you know, four laps or twenty paces or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202152\">and see if it can calm you down a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20216\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20217\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve come up with things to say before. I\u2019m not sure I will call on any of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20218\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20219\">THERAPIST: Use one that works for now.

(LAUGHTER) (inaudible at 00:42:01) I don\u2019t know what to think about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021C\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021D\">THERAPIST: What about saying... Would something that sort of said like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get through this,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m getting through this the best I can...\u201d Would something like that feel genuine?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N2021E\"><span data-id=\"P13-N2021F\">CLIENT: Actually, \u201cI need to slow down,\u201d sounds like something useful to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20220\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20221\">THERAPIST: Ah. Can we change that to, \u201cIt will help me to slow down a bit,\u201d because I\u2019m just worried that, \u201cI need to slow down,\u201d is going to feel like a command that you might feel like you failed just in case it doesn\u2019t work right now. It will work sometime. But it might not work every time and I <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202211\">don\u2019t want you to feel like you failed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20222\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20223\">CLIENT: Right now I feel like I\u2019m getting through with brute force.

Or, \u201cI am slowing down.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P13-N20224\"><span data-id=\"P13-N20225\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. How about that? That sounds supportive, encouraging. You\u2019re... You\u2019ve got... It\u2019s like your natural tendency is to go to the mentality of like a really tough coach. Like you\u2019re just going to muscle through this any way you can no matter what. And bringing in like a softer, kinder <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N202251\">coach of, \u201cI\u2019m going to slow down,\u201d or, \u201cI am slowing down right now...\u201d It\u2019s like the nice coach coming in.
