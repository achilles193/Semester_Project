(coughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Let me sort of take a moment here to just try to understand. I saw you guys, I think it was a month ago that I saw you. And you guys seemed like you thought you were on a much better path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">MALE CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: So something clearly changed between then and now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">MALE CLIENT: It's like this every other day. Things are fine and then it's the end of the world. It's just how -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, he blames everything on me.

And he doesn't want to change. He doesn't want to change for the better. Like it's good when you have like someone to come to. Like we didn't go for months, and then he was accountable and he tried more. But since we weren't going, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D1\">like he stopped all that. He stopped doing everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">And like just because I cry and I get upset, like he never thinks that maybe, you know, that's part of what he's doing to me. Like I feel like I'm like all alone in this relationship with him. He just distances himself and he takes no accountability and he pushes like all the blame on me because I'm <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F1\">upset. Like just because I'm upset and I cry. I'm like deeply hurt by him. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559586\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">And he (sniffling) fails to recognize like that's something that like we need to talk about.

This is what he's been doing with all his free time, he bikes. He doesn't try to work on our relationship, he bikes like for hours. He'll go like to the biking store and spend his money there. Like and then he complains about being broke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">Instead of like trying to better our relationship, this is what he's been doing.

You didn't answer her question. You're basically just saying just saying what's on your mind. You're not Do you understand what I'm saying?

I usually don't do this, but I can give it a try. I have a couple of sessions and then I have a half hour break. I don't know if you guys want to stick around. If you want to stick around and go do something here, I can meet with <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF1\">you for a half hour in like an hour and a half or something. I have to look at my schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">So that's option number one because I know that Tuesdays are basically your only day off.
