(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Not much is going on. [I\u2019m just seeing stuff that is being easy at work.] (ph?) I guess I\u2019m feeling okay and not so anxious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s good. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m still keeping a little bit of distance from people or being alone, trying to get my stuff done that I need to. I guess it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m anxious or anything. It\u2019s what\u2019s more comfortable or I\u2019m thinking what else I need to do, being in that mode.  I guess it\u2019s very controlled. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">Other than that, (pause) there\u2019s the feeling of I need to be working on something or working on myself or I should be thinking about something in particular. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: I wonder if, at this moment, that\u2019s partly a manifestation of the state you\u2019re describing in here, where we\u2019re just kind of talking and saying stuff and it feels more social. Whereas if you are here, knowing that you need to focus on this or work on that or something, it\u2019s more task-oriented <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">and feels safer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: I guess it gives me something to talk about, to be in task mode.  (long pause)  I guess things have been a little boring, kind of mundane, but I feel like I\u2019m working enough and pushing myself to do small things, like cooking or working out or whatever. But I\u2019m not tired at the end of the day, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">so I guess I feel it\u2019s a day well spent or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I imagine [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I guess sometimes. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: What do you mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Sometimes I like to feel productive, but I guess I\u2019m just always wanting something more. I could be doing what I\u2019m doing better. I guess I\u2019m not very mindful. It\u2019s just habitual, these things that I\u2019m kind of doing. I guess the pushing myself comes with getting started.  That\u2019s kind of in play. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">[ ] (inaudible at 00:10:05) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: So there is still a lack of a sense of fulfillment in a way or satisfaction or maybe a sense of yourself in it, in a way? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) I don\u2019t know. (pause)  I guess it seems kind of silly to be thinking about it or [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:07). (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I wonder if you feel less sure of its importance because I didn\u2019t get what you meant or I didn\u2019t see how this was the thing at first, like maybe you don\u2019t really have anything to complain about. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. It just seems like I\u2019m unsure what I want and it\u2019s like I feel if I could figure all that out it would be better, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not so much that . . . (pause) I don\u2019t know.  I guess I just feel like I\u2019m being nitpicky or complaining about something that\u2019s fine or something. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: So is this one of those moments where you kind of feel two different ways at once \u2013 both figuring out what you actually want matters and like you\u2019re making something out of nothing and are just complaining?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I feel like it\u2019s the whole thing. If I\u2019m unsatisfied with something then just figure out what I want to change it and then just deal with it. It feels like the same thought.  It\u2019s like I need to not think about it, but just kind of figure it out. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562434\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: I see. So the point isn\u2019t the thoughts of complaining about not knowing what you want; the point is to just figure out what you want and you should just go about doing that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right.  (long pause) I guess figuring out what I want seems messy or not plausible or very uncertain. (pause)  I guess that\u2019s why it kind of seems okay that it\u2019s fine, what I am doing. It\u2019s not negative or it\u2019s positive things or something. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: Figuring out what you want seems daunting and maybe frightening. It can be difficult to do and you anticipate it will be kind of a messy thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. In the end it will just lead to more disappointment or throw me off track or something.  (long pause)  It\u2019s all very vague or . . . I don\u2019t know. (long pause)  I guess it always kind of seems of ways of filling time or distracting me from feeling down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: The way you want, you mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Yeah, and what I do, like what I\u2019m supposed to do next. But it works and it\u2019s fine for the most part. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re also saying there is kind of an underlying feeling down? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of a feeling of giving up or being lazy or just general disappointment, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I think your [impression is pretty big.] (ph?) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:27) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s related to the question of what you want, in that you don\u2019t want that to be there. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right.  (pause) Maybe it\u2019s just something \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 satisfaction or . . . yeah. (long pause)  I guess it just comes down to I don\u2019t know what to do or that I have to keep doing the same thing. It\u2019s manageable enough. Some things aren\u2019t too out of control. I don\u2019t know. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: What you do works, for the most part, when you can do it, to keep you from feeling that underlying down feeling?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  But I don\u2019t know. I guess it feels like I\u2019m just complaining about change or something silly or indulgent. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: My sense is that you kind of feel like you\u2019re talking about conditions in your life that feel fundamental and, I guess, unchangeable if you could imagine what it would look like if it were different, I think. You might as well be complaining about something else that is inevitably characteristic <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">of you or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right.  (long pause)  I guess if I\u2019m just being resistant or stubborn or . . . (long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I see. If you weren\u2019t, you would have more of an idea how you could change these things or that being able to talk about them would make them different in some way? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Right, but I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s your concern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of not sure.  I guess I don\u2019t know how to [say it.] (ph?) (long pause) It\u2019s kind of a feeling like resistance or stubbornness, but I don\u2019t know what to change or how to even start or if there is anything else there [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:23) or if it\u2019s just me <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">being emotional or something.

(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Saying things about it is significant. It\u2019s huge significance, really, in a way that you don\u2019t often do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: It seems like I guess I\u2019ve been complaining or not being grateful or [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:15). (pause) For the most part, I\u2019m functioning. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">THERAPIST: You seem quite sure that you\u2019re doing something wrong, and I think also that this makes you a real downer. (pause)  We only have a minute. I think this is actually quite important in your life and I take your point that you\u2019re functioning pretty well and things are going okay, so that makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">you feel ungrateful to complain \u2013 or and as though you are complaining. It seems to me that it\u2019s a big part of how you feel, though, which kind of makes it important in its own right, even if there is a lot you\u2019re able to get done.
