It\u2019s good to be back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">THERAPIST: Good. Welcome back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">CLIENT: I\u2019m pretty okay this week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">CLIENT: Things converged to make that easier. Frank was off work this week, so I didn\u2019t have to work late ever. There was somebody else at home, so I wasn\u2019t with all three kids all the time. That was the main thing. I didn\u2019t have to work too much.  (chuckles) Jackson was off of school this week for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200151\">Spring Break and Wednesday it was raining, so Monica and Frank were like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s take them to the Museum.\u201d (laughs) Along with every other family in Denver, apparently. Frank had to go downtown to give a presentation, so it was me and the three kids. I\u2019ve only ever taken them to the Museum with <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200152\">just me, so it was not big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:49) it\u2019s a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Now that Sharon is more mobile and more . . . She\u2019s so bossy, though. Oh, my God. (laughs)  It would be like they would all go off at once and I would be like, \u201cI can\u2019t see you if you move more than eight feet away from me, there are so many people.\u201d Oh well. The nice thing about that museum <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">is what\u2019s the worst that can happen? They get lost and separated and are upset about it. It will be fine. So that\u2019s good. That was not low-pressure for me. (laughs) (pause) Today it\u2019s warm. It\u2019s supposed to be a high of 50\u00b0 tomorrow. Seriously? Seriously? (chuckles) Ugh. (pause)  James\u2019s birthday was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">yesterday, so we really didn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m going to bake a cake for Sabbath tomorrow with Franco, so that\u2019s good. He\u2019s almost done, apparently for real this time, with the paper that he\u2019s been working on for the last three months. (chuckling) He was like, \u201cYou know my family is all going to call. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200193\">That\u2019s really nice, but I really just want to get this paper finished.\u201d (pause) I hope you had a good break. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Thanks. It was nice. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve been reading The Windup Bird Chronicles, by Murakami. She owes a lot to Pynchon, basically, and that\u2019s sort of the genre that he\u2019s writing in. And it\u2019s good.  I was talking with James earlier today when we were on a walk. He\u2019s been reading a memoir by an author we both really like, Cheryl <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">Strayed, about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail after her mother died. Basically it\u2019s a way to sort of move through grief; and he was talking about his dissatisfaction with the memoir as the way she describes it is \u201cI was grieving and I did all of these really shitty things,\u201d but I think she cheated on <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D2\">her husband several times and ended up getting a divorce over that and she got deeply involved with drugs and all that. I read this a year ago and I don\u2019t remember it very well.  She seems to have this idea that now she can see the whole picture and she can see that everything that she did had to happen, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D3\">that all of this stuff that she did was necessary in order to get her to the place where she could start to heal. James was like, \u201cI don\u2019t really like that.\u201d (laughs) Perhaps [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:27) I was not [ ] but my sense is that, in some ways, Moore Cumming is the opposite, and it\u2019s one of <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D4\">the things I like about post-modern fiction, that it very clearly says things are messy and you don\u2019t figure everything out; you never figure everything out sometimes.  That\u2019s how it is. It is a very striking divide and I feel like where the book that I\u2019ve been reading falls down is when the author <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D5\">tries too hard to explain things or when he\u2019s not comfortable enough, either with letting the readers put together the pieces that he\u2019s let fall or with not answering questions. I don\u2019t really need you to explain to me that this is that guy from before or that there are these similarities. That\u2019s my <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D6\">job. (laughs) (pause) I think what is bothering James is that when you start saying it was necessary that these things happen because of where my life is now, then you really start to distance yourself from responsibility.  If I said it was necessary that I cheated on my husband, well maybe, but you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D7\">still hurt him and that\u2019s something that\u2019s on you now. You have to fix it or not fix it or [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:23). It\u2019s good to read a book. (pause) It\u2019s also nice that one of the reasons that I haven\u2019t been reading much is I have sort of been telling myself that I don\u2019t have the time to sit down <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D8\">and read a book in one sitting or devote a day to it.  This is a 600-page book and I basically read it on the bus or at the bus stop. I guess I sometimes feel like, if I\u2019m reading for 20 minutes, I can\u2019t get enough to keep the flow of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562476\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:14)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:09:17) (long pause) I don\u2019t know. I definitely enjoyed talking with James about this book much more than I remembered enjoying reading the book, the memoir. (pause)  I\u2019ve been writing a lot, too, which is nice. Candace and I are writing about theology, God help us. (both <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200211\">laugh) [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:24) There was a line from Buffy: \u201cI\u2019m not jumping to conclusions. I just took one tiny step and conclusions were there.\u201d (both laugh) I wrote about this scholar who came to talk at my church, about some of the things I didn\u2019t agree with him at all about, and Candace and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200212\">I ended up having a pretty extensive conversation on it in comments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: [You mean the two of you?] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: Yeah, and James as well. I had a friend who read it and was reading that, both the post and the conversation, was, by far, the best thing for her about that presentation. That was really good. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. (pause) I guess I feel like I\u2019ve been doing a lot of good work. I\u2019ve been doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">a lot with the kids.  It\u2019s good for me and I can see how it\u2019s good for them. I\u2019m writing, not just a lot, but I\u2019m writing good things and it\u2019s a genre that I\u2019m suited for. I\u2019m sewing and that\u2019s fun; and making things I like and that\u2019s fun. It feels nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: I did slice my finger open yesterday. I was cutting an apple and kind of slipped, which I don\u2019t really ever do at home, but I do all the time at work. (laughs) I think it\u2019s just too much going on at once. I have a hard time not multi-tasking, like not trying to address each problem as it comes <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">up.  I sort of know that when you have small children, you have to ignore them sometimes. All three talk at once and you can only answer one person, that sort of thing, but it\u2019s hard for them. Just like when I\u2019m talking with the parents and the kids interrupt, it\u2019s hard for me not to turn immediately <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200292\">to the kids. Frank and Monica both seem to have this problem. (laughs) Frank taught me how to make Khichdi, which is a northern Indian dish. It\u2019s basically like one-pot comfort food, apparently, all over India. They make it for the kids all the time and it\u2019s really, really good.  He taught me how to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200293\">make it and sent me home with a little bit of all the spices, so now my bag smells like Asafetida, which is not that good of a smell.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20028-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20028-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562476\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Is that one of the spices?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (long pause) [Hainan] (ph?) that\u2019s the Indian word for it.  I\u2019m going to try to make that tonight. James really likes lentils and rice. I like them okay, but I get really bored if it\u2019s just lentils and rice; but this is really good so I\u2019ll try it tonight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2002F\">THERAPIST: Good luck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20031\">CLIENT: Thanks. (laughs) (pause) I was thinking about cooking now. (pause) I feel like both Monica and Frank are both very good cooks out of the stuff that they know how to make.  So much of it is Indian food. A lot of it is just British. They make a lot of tabouli and stuff like that. They are totally <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200311\">in awe of me because I can make pastry dough. Really? (laughs) This is really easy, but I\u2019m totally in awe of them because they can make shepherd\u2019s pie, which is also really easy, as I found out when I started making it. It\u2019s need because Frank was making chicken pot pie this week and he took out the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200312\">frozen pie crust and then realized that you have to wait for it to defrost.  He was like, \u201cTanya, can you come and make pie crust?\u201d instead of making it himself. (laughs) I am happy to look good here but . . . (pause) Sharon is super excited about food right now. Even when she\u2019s not particularly hungry, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200313\">when she sits down to eat a meal and it\u2019s something that she likes, she\u2019ll go \u201cWow!\u201d It\u2019s just delightful. She makes these rapturous noises. I know, Sharon. I feel that way whenever I eat something also.  (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: A little [epicurean sensitive.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think I\u2019m really happy for you to be back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: Really? Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: I was thinking that my week wasn\u2019t actually that good. (laughs) It wasn\u2019t bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: You\u2019re just feeling [ ] (inaudible at 00:18:36).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m just feeling good. (pause)  I went to an Easter vigil service on Sunday. I found out about this a long time ago. It was 4:30 in the morning, 4:30 \u2013 8:00, basically. I went to a lot of church last weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Early Sunday morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes. Everybody had tapers. It was this beautiful service and it was very moving for me and really wonderful to be a part of. Of course, the story that sticks with me and that now I tell people is that a girl\u2019s hair caught on fire. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Oh, God. Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: So we all had tapers. It was this candlelight service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Does that just mean a candle or is it a special kind of candle?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: No, it was just a little candle. Yeah, I guess I should have . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: When I think of a taper, I just didn\u2019t know if there were . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: I think of a taper as the kind of candles that you would put in a candlestick on a dinner table, like a long, narrow candle, as opposed to a short, fat one that\u2019s supposed to be [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:06).  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually right. We were all holding candles and she has long <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">hair and it just caught and she just beat it out with a program and then she just kept going. She was like \u201cit\u2019s fine; whatever.\u201d (laughs) There was burnt hair and incense for the next hour and a half. I also dropped my bread into the communion chalice. You get bread and then you either can eat the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">bread and take a sip of wine from the cup or you can dip it in the cup. I usually take a sip, but they had real bread and they gave me this big piece. I was like I can\u2019t handle that. I can\u2019t just stuff it in my mouth in time.  So I went to dip it and it just broke off into the cup. (laughs) I\u2019m like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D3\">I don\u2019t know [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:06) It was at the monastery down the street, like an Episcopal monastery, and the monk was like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just fish it out.\u201d (laughs) Adventures in religion.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562476\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: I guess so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: I guess that\u2019s a good lesson. I\u2019ve been going to church for my whole life. It can always get weirder. (laughs) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: There is what you said, but there is also something affectionate and close in out the way you\u2019re telling some of these stories sometimes that I can\u2019t put my finger on. I\u2019m not quite able to, but [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:27).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: A sort of pre-articulation stage?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: I was just thinking about how I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the stories or how you\u2019re telling it or something like that.

[ ] (inaudible at 00:24:01) (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: I mean I\u2019m telling everybody.

Like I said, I\u2019m not quite putting my finger on what it is. (pause) Maybe it\u2019s that it\u2019s \u2013 okay . . . Things were, in a very mild way, out of control. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know.

Really [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:57) but I feel like for me the goal is not so much to put myself in a mental space where I think that everything that has happened to me had to happen, as it is to put myself in a space where I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">that it\u2019s okay that things don\u2019t make sense, if that makes sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah, because I think it\u2019s hard for you and makes you anxious with me and with other people, too, to feel like you are feeling things that are not under control, that don\u2019t feel under control to you. It feels like it\u2019s pretty dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">CLIENT: That is one of the reasons I really like going to church.  That\u2019s pretty much the only place that I can think of where it\u2019s okay for things to not be in control. It has these uncontrolled upswellings of emotions and it\u2019s not clear where they\u2019re coming from. I cry in church a lot or get really <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200651\">happy for no reason. That\u2019s sort of okay. (pause) I don\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s okay with anybody else, but I don\u2019t really care. (laughs)  (long pause)  Now I feel sort of like maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said that. I worry that maybe I will hurt your feelings somehow [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:44).<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562476\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20067\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not clear how? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20069\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s by \u2013 it seems a little bit ridiculous when I say it out loud \u2013 I guess it\u2019s the idea that there is a place where I feel comfortable not being in control, and it\u2019s not here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006D\">CLIENT: More comfortable. Sort of comfortable. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2006F\">THERAPIST: That would be a little bit rejecting of me in some way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20073\">THERAPIST: I gather there is more than just that you feel more comfortable with feelings that are out of control there, but also that something about the size of the feelings and the way [your needs] (ph?) and the frequency of it would also be part of what you would imagine I would be hurt by. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20075\">CLIENT: That seems less important. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s more like the way it feels safer there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Or you care less or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It sort of feels like I guess I\u2019m worried not so much that you would have a problem with the fact, but the way that I said it would be hurtful, like it was not well timed, if that makes sense, I think. (pause) Maybe it\u2019s like I know that you are going to find it reasonable for <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D1\">me to find comfort in places that are comfortable in other places, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t have an emotional reaction to it.  That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t going to hurt you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">THERAPIST: And if I\u2019m talking about how you have seen, in a way, that I\u2019m thinking about things we were saying, I\u2019m much more comfortable then over there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">THERAPIST: That I sort of feel like \u2013 ohh. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">CLIENT: I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s hard for me to bring out things where I feel bad about some very small interaction. It\u2019s like maybe I shouldn\u2019t say that and I think maybe it will just go away. (laughs) (pause) I don\u2019t like doing things that are hard. (laughs) I told Selena she has to clean up her room <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200851\">and she has to clean up the downstairs and she was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d  I know. I don\u2019t want to either. I thought I told you this Friday. The secret to being a grown-up, the only thing you have to do to be a grown-up is to learn how to clean up after yourself when you don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s all <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200852\">there is, Selena. (laughs) Eventually we cleaned up the living room. That didn\u2019t do it, shockingly enough. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">THERAPIST: I care much more about maturity than I do about not cleaning the living room. I\u2019ll do it right away. (both laugh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">CLIENT: I think she thought that by admitting I didn\u2019t want to clean up either, that I going to not make her do it.  No, we still have to do it. Sorry. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">THERAPIST: I see what you mean. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">CLIENT: Sometimes I feel like that is basically the difference between me now and me as a child, that it is easier for me to make myself do the things that I don\u2019t want to do. Sometimes. (scoffs) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">THERAPIST: There seems to be a bit of a \u201cmess\u201d theme in the last few minutes, I think. I\u2019m thinking of the bread, maybe the hair a little bit, although maybe not quite that. That may be a stretch. Then your worry about having hurt me. I guess I sort of assume that your ambivalence about bringing that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">up and then the decision to bring it up and bring it up as sort of like in a caveat.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562476\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">CLIENT: (laughs)  Yeah, that seems about right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">THERAPIST: And it all sort of follows or seems to be related to your talking about being so happy to see me and I wonder if that\u2019s sort of part of your feeling that when you feel like [ ] (inaudible at 00:40:37) close to somebody that\u2019s going to cause trouble. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ve been worrying a lot recently about the degree to which the [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:11) as a family, like that\u2019s not good at all. That can\u2019t be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you had mentioned it that Sharon wanted to go to you and not to her.

(pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">THERAPIST: I imagine the worry there is that you\u2019ll hurt the kids.

Well it\u2019s hard because I worry that my relationship with the parents will be that I\u2019ll sort of overstep workplace boundaries. In some sense, I\u2019m in this family [as life,] (ph?) but I\u2019m also an employee and I worry about my ability to navigate that in an appropriate way.  I really need <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D1\">them in a lot of ways. I really do and I both want to be straightforward about that without getting super confessional about it. I\u2019m not particularly interested in pretending that that\u2019s not the case, but I also don\u2019t know if that\u2019s okay with them.
