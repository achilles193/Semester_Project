Did you sign one there as well?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: Yes, I did. It was a weird form. It didn\u2019t ask for your phone number. It asked for your address, so maybe you\u2019ll get (inaudible phrase at (00:00:27) in the mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so I was there on Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">THERAPIST: How did it go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not quite sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">(16 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">Highly qualified, I\u2019m sure, but some of the decisions she made seemed kind of strange and weren\u2019t communicated very well to me and then were not communicated at all to the pharmacist. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">THERAPIST: Okay, start from the beginning. What happened?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: She said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to change this medication down, and we\u2019re going to increase this one and then switch the one at the end of the day from 300 400 (inaudible at (00:01:31).\u201d That one, I sleep just fine on the 300 a day. I got put down to 200 in the morning from 300, because \u201cwe want <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">to make you less sleepy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I left there and went to CVS because I got the text that it was filled, and there was only one prescription. It was the 400. So I called them back and said, \u201cCan you just go over with me what the changes are because I want to make sure this makes sense.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">\u201cIs there something I should take in the morning?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">\u201cNope.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">I got a call back an hour later, \u201cActually, you are supposed to take 200 mg of this in the morning and we\u2019ve called it in to CVS.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">It\u2019s not a big deal, but I felt a little bit annoyed. I\u2019m actually not taking the 400 mg at night, I\u2019m still taking the 300 because I have a large quantity left and I sleep just fine into the night and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Have you switched to taking the lower dose in the morning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Is this Wellbutrin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: No, this one is Pregabalin (ph). Wellbutrin I\u2019m cutting down 400 to 300, increasing Setraline (ph) from 200 to 250 and then... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Did those make sense to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, I wanted to get off the Wellbutrin. It\u2019s such a high dosage. It\u2019s the maximum you can take, 450, and the insurance company wasn\u2019t happy about it, anyway, and I don\u2019t want to be on all these drugs. It\u2019s kind of funny because every time I go to the psychiatrist, a new one, my wife says, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200411\">\u201cAsk them to put you on Lithium because it was excellent for me.\u201d She\u2019s (ph) not bipolar, but for her it took care of all these symptoms that I apparently share and so she gets frustrated when I don\u2019t insist. I mean, it\u2019s a first appointment, I\u2019m not going to say, \u201cDo this,\u201d without any kind of understanding <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200412\">of where I\u2019ve been. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">I was encouraged because she said she was going to talk to you and talk to my primary care and check the blood work that I had done in November. That\u2019s fine. Again, it just takes so long to move forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">THERAPIST: When is your next follow-up?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">CLIENT: February 7th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">I\u2019ll go in and say, \u201cWell, you know, I didn\u2019t follow your instructions exactly, but...\u201d At the same time it seems like I always feel agitated anyway, so what\u2019s the worst that can happen unless it gives me stomach cramps or something like that. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, I think the important thing to do is know what you are doing and over the next couple weeks see if you can do some tracking of what your symptoms are, how your sleep is, how energetic you feel, if there\u2019s a change in the sense of motivation that you have to follow through on things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">So you can go in with some information about like, \u201cHere\u2019s what I actually did.\u201d Regardless of whether it\u2019s exactly what she said or not, but so she knows what you are doing, what you are taking, and if that has a noticeable impact on any of the target symptoms anxiety or lethargy, etc., so she\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B2\">got real information to go on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: That\u2019s a good idea, because it seems like, \u201cHow have I been over the past month?\u201d I can\u2019t remember how I felt the past week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Right. It\u2019s really hard to do self report on past feelings and behaviors is not very reliable. It\u2019s much more reliable if you kind of take notes on yourself in the moment, because it\u2019s really hard to go back and think well, \u201cHow did I feel last week?\u201d It gets lost and it gets washed away <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">by what you\u2019re feeling now. If you can just jot down in your calendar, \u201cfeeling really, really anxious today\u201d or \u201cfeeling really lethargic in the morning\u201d. These are things that are going to be a little bit more reliable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll definitely have to make a point of doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">Those changes are now in place and I guess I don\u2019t feel all that different. I didn\u2019t expect a change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: Right, certainly not within two days. But, you\u2019ve now sort of embarked on the process of establishing a relationship with somebody who can more closely track because you hadn\u2019t been able to do that for a long time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, and not having to dish out like $300 to do it. It\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s a plus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yes, it makes you a little bit more likely to go back for frequent follow up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t really know what the coverage is really, but she does accept my insurance (ph). But apparently the changes in the healthcare law are now going to allow me to change to something else. I assume she takes other things as well. I don\u2019t know what they offer yet. It\u2019s weird (ph) that the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">question I asked you a couple weeks ago as far as (inaudible phrase at ).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Keep me posted and if we can get you covered by insurance, we will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: Alright. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">I went up to Vermont. I did not go ice fishing. I helped build sleeping lofts which was good, I guess. I was kind of nervous about bringing my dog up there because she\u2019s been kind of needy. [This guy] (ph) said, \u201cI tell you what. It\u2019s going to be raining up there and my wife and daughter don\u2019t want <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">to go up so they said why don\u2019t they take Sparky(sp) while you and I go up to (the big mountain) (ph).\u201d I thought, \u201cWow that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d because I really needed a vacation from that dog! (chuckle) I\u2019ve been taking care of her myself the past three weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: You were a little bit anxious, too, about being in that family dynamic with the kid and \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not just the family dynamic as much as it is any kind of social gathering. I don\u2019t know, but it was interesting because I\u2019ve never spent time alone \u2014 actually, that\u2019s not true. I went fishing with him once with myself, but that was just a few hours. This was an entire Friday to Sunday and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">it was great. I\u2019ve always known him to be an easy-going guy, but there\u2019s just no pre-tense at all. He is just so down to earth. He\u2019s this five foot, barely, Asian guy from Maine, I\u2019ve known for a while. He just looks like a boy. He\u2019s really slight, and yet he works for State Street Investments. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200652\">just a huge...it hasn\u2019t changed him at all. He\u2019s very well off, and yet he still likes to go to garage sales. He still likes to go fishing. It\u2019s like these things that are \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: He knows who he is. He\u2019s comfortable with who he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: Exactly. It\u2019s inspiring in a way. I don\u2019t know how I can get there, necessarily, but it was just nice to be around somebody who was like that. It was a good time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What was the best part and what was the worst part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Probably the same event. On Saturday morning we were going to get lumber and it was like a skating rink and he\u2019d hooked up his trailer and he went to this first (bump he heard) (ph)  and he pulled in. It was kind of a slope going down, like that, and he said, \u201cOh, I think they\u2019re closed.\u201d I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how far in you want to keep going.\u201d And we just sort of started sliding down, just uncontrolled. It was horrible because I didn\u2019t think we were going to get out of there. He had one thing of kitty litter. I got out and just started dishing it out around and he\u2019d just go little by <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D2\">little by little, and finally he got up all the way and we were just laughing our heads off. We had this vision of stopping a truck to pull us out. That kind of set the bar real low. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) For the rest of the weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: It was kind of hilarious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: That really does pull you into the moment. There can\u2019t be anything but the moment right then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Your senses just focus on not falling down or \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: \u2014 getting caught under the wheel of a skidding truck. (chuckle) Sometimes it can be nice to have a very singular focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: It was up there toward the top and the bottom. Not getting out (ph) fast enough was at the bottom, but I was laughing my head off when I got back in the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Feels good to laugh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: It was interesting. Yesterday I was listening to a show that I hate Providence Public Radio on GPH and it\u2019s these two people that I just can\u2019t stand. Anyway, one segment was on this report that suggests that men don\u2019t have enough friends, male friends, and they were talking about the stigma <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">of appearing gay if you\u2019re (with your guy) (ph at 00:14:11). And they said, \u201cGuys do stuff together like go the bar, watch a game, do sports or whatever, but unlike women who typically talk to other women more intimately and more frequently, men don\u2019t really have that kind of relationship with other men \u2014 typically.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">And I started thinking about my dad, again\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">(10 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">\u2014 and myself and I was trying to identify those relationships I have that are intimate or just with other males. I do. I think my brother is one of those who I can talk to about anything. I don\u2019t know that I have a lot of others, especially out here, with that same kind of connection. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">really not (inaudible phrase) earth-shattering, but it did give me pause to consider my own situation. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20082-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20082-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Do you feel you have female friend with whom you can talk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: I do, to a point, but the female friend dynamic is more difficult for me. I think we\u2019ve talked about that. What does it mean to be friends with me? I have a hard time understanding why anyone would be friends with me male or female. Therefore, a female wanting to be friends with me must be <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200871\">interested in me, or something like that. But somewhat related to that, I had this moment up in Vermont when I caught myself looking around, seeing what the place might need, that I could give him. That I could \u2014 <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: Kind of to sort of ingratiate yourself, you think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, and I said to myself, \u201cYou know, you really don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: He\u2019s already invited you up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: And I\u2019ve already helped him build six more sleeping areas for this place and so it was somewhat obligatory that I caught myself doing that and noticing that I\u2019ve done it in the past without even stopping to think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, I remember before you went to France you were talking about doing that with a woman with whom you were staying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">THERAPIST: Finding ways to be useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">CLIENT: Yes, but I think that was a little bit different only because I was so appreciative of her letting me stay there without paying for a month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: Well, it felt more justified. I think it\u2019s a similar process, because she wasn\u2019t asking for... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: No, I think that relationship was easy to adapt to because I\u2019m malleable in that way. I can show my gratitude or show how worthy a friend I am by what I can do, what I can provide, how conscientious I can be, how thoughtful and considerate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Because you don\u2019t trust that your friendship is valuable enough in itself. Without knowing this guy, I can imagine the reason he was interested in you coming up with him was probably not primarily for your building skills, but (cross-talk at ) I\u2019m guessing primarily for your companionship <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D1\">and this was also the thing that he wanted to get done in the house that weekend and you weren\u2019t going to sit and watch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: No, I\u2019ve offered to help him with projects in the past. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: But he could have hired a contractor if he wanted to get it done really fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: So, trusting your companionship, that you as a person are valuable to your friends\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: And so I guess I struggle with that. I see what I tend to do now, at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Catching yourself in the moment and being able to choose another course is a really significant step in being able to change that pattern. You have to do that again and again, but you can do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: I seem to also do it out of guilt, because of the people back in Maine, my friend Chris, for example. He\u2019s done so much for me over the years. He\u2019s such a giving person and he\u2019s around a lot of taking people and he\u2019s probably my closest friend and\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">(13 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">I went out to see them two or three times not solely to see them, but to have to go back to Maine for various reasons and I felt bad about telling him that I was going to come out in January and then telling him that I won\u2019t be coming out in January. And that\u2019s kind of wrapped up in the fact that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF1\">I rarely acknowledge his kids\u2019 birthdays. I guess I just forget, or I\u2019m just completely oblivious to them. He was telling me four weeks ago about how they would win this LEGO robot thing, and you\u2019ve had to experience those yourself (chuckle). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m quite skilled at LEGOs, yes. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">CLIENT: Well, it\u2019s robotics that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: They have moveable pieces that they\u2019re engineering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Yeah, that they can control with remote-control and stuff. (chuckle) You seem like you\u2019re thrilled about this!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">THERAPIST: LEGOs are a fabulous educational tool. I think LEGOs are wonderful, actually. They happen to be all over my house. (chuckle)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">CLIENT: (chuckle) Yes, I seem to remember that, especially those small ones with just the caps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">CLIENT: Well, he was telling me how they were doing this weekend competition and so on and so forth and I started thinking, \u201cOh, I can do something with that.\u201d So, I was able to find this kit which is a next step up from that and so I got that for Christmas. I felt like that was good because it was <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF1\">something they would really actually use and enjoy and learn, but it also kind of took me out of myself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">THERAPIST: Yes, you were thinking about others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">CLIENT: I think that, thinking about myself a bit, which has been so \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">THERAPIST: And that felt good, to be taken out of yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">CLIENT: Yes, it\u2019s primary impulse to just be in my own head it\u2019s something that because of that, I also really felt guilty that I haven\u2019t really been nurturing the relationships of those who I care about. So, I guess this all comes back to (I\u2019m not being present) (ph), but I suppose I can be present <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C71\">without remembering somebody\u2019s birthday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Yes. There are lots of ways to be present in a relationship, I think. And events anniversaries, birthdays, etc. are not necessarily actually even the best indicator of how attuned you are to somebody. With Facebook, anybody can send you a birthday message on your birthday. It doesn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C91\">require much thought or connection at all, right? But remembering a piece of a conversation that, oh, they went to this thing and his kids are into LEGO engineering or LEGO robotics, that actually shows much more connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">I think the really interesting piece of this story is you only let yourself feel good for a short while before you flipped it into feeling guilty that you hadn\u2019t done it more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">CLIENT: Well, yes, that was my point, though, was the friendship feeling that I needed to go over the top to make up for it or that my friendship isn\u2019t valuable and I guess that I\u2019m recognizing it but I would like to try to find ways to kind of celebrate those relationships pro-actively as opposed <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD1\">to reactively based on guilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I\u2019d like to see you be able to celebrate them not with the things that you can do but in a way that you can be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, I get that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: I think this past weekend when you spent so much time with this friend and, yeah, you were doing something valuable, helping him to get a project done on his house it\u2019s a big project. But I imagine there was time in between where you were just being, just providing companionship.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200D2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D5\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D7\">THERAPIST: And then being able to see that that in itself is really valuable. Being able to enjoy that and giving yourself credit for it. I think that\u2019s the piece to practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200D9\">CLIENT: I hear you and I think it was a bit easier for me because I\u2019ve been a little bit more attuned to my anxieties about those kinds of things and I think it was also helped by the fact that it was just him and me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yes, not having to manage a group dynamic on top of these other things that you\u2019re paying attention to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DD\">CLIENT: I think one of the issues I have with people back in Maine is that I really don\u2019t miss any of them and I don\u2019t really want to go back there. Certain people I do miss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF\">THERAPIST: Those are the relationships to pay attention to. Relationships with people who you don\u2019t miss, you can let them go. It\u2019s okay for not every relationship to be a forever friendship, but picking some people with whom you really do want to maintain a relationship, whether it be somebody from <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF1\">Maine or somebody here, you\u2019re going to have a lot more success if your desire to be in a relationship is genuine in being able to actually stay engaged and be there and present in a relationship. A relationship that you\u2019re maintaining out of a sense of guilt is not going to be one that you\u2019re going <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200DF2\">to be able to be really present for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E1\">CLIENT: Yes. You know there\u2019s this thing on Facebook. It\u2019s \u201c37 Things You Will Regret When You Are Old\u201d or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Hmm, that\u2019s lovely. (chuckle) What was meaningful for you in there?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E5\">CLIENT: Well, there was a lot and it wasn\u2019t because I\u2019m not doing them. I am doing these things that it\u2019s saying you really should be doing so you don\u2019t regret having not done these things when you grow old. I felt really good about a lot of them. One of them, though, that kind of struck me was \u201cSay <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E51\">good-bye to \u2014 Friendships are not forever.\u201d Some will pass and that\u2019s okay to let them go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E7\">(23 second pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200E9\">The other thing that the psychiatrist suggested is that I need more structure in my day. I\u2019ve actually built a schedule now, depending on the day. So, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I do this and Tuesday, Thursday, I do this. The real difference is just going to the gym. I\u2019ve been to the gym six times in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200E91\">the past two weeks and I feel good about that. I\u2019m also being reminded of the whole Jung\u2019s(sp) thing and I don\u2019t have to do everything all at once. I don\u2019t have to do it correctly or successfully every single time. Things we talked about last week. I\u2019m still working on those. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EB\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s a practice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yes. The other thing she said was\u2014 I didn\u2019t get anything into my work with you at all, except she says, \u201cCBT?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200EF\">I said, \u201cYes, I guess.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">She said, \u201cThe one thing I\u2019d recommend is for people to not dwell in the past.\u201d This woman\u2019s real Romanian and she has a very thick accent. She comes off as very authoritarian, but it\u2019s just kind of \u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Directive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">CLIENT: Directive. Anyway, I\u2019m taking those to heart. It\u2019s really uncomfortable with these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s sounds like there\u2019s some overlap in our perspective which is helpful that we\u2019re picking (ph) on the same team. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">CLIENT: Exactly. So, there\u2019s that. I\u2019m still working on it and... I don\u2019t know what else.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N200F8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FB\">(16 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD\">I was at the gym yesterday and I was at the end of my workout, this yoga routine on the floor. There was a TV up on the wall. Typically I just have my headphones in and I\u2019m kind of [set up] (ph) to yoga music that helps me to relax. Anyway, there was this commercial on and it was this crazy car commercial. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200FD1\">And you know how they usually say at the bottom \u201cclosed course, professional driver\u201d? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200FF\">THERAPIST: (chuckle) Yes, do not attempt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20101\">CLIENT: Yes. This one was a little bit more comical and it said, \u201cThis is a fantasy, do not attempt. Cars cannot ride (ph) on trains. This is still a fantasy, do not attempt.\u201d Things like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20103\">It struck me, the whole fantasy thing, \u201cdo not attempt\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20105\">(12 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20107\">And that fantasy, in and of itself as a mechanism I\u2019m starting to warm to the idea that it\u2019s okay and that it\u2019s healthy. It\u2019s a reaction to something else. I guess I\u2019m starting to look at it more as be not concerned or feel guilty or bad about the fantasy, just concerned or attentive to the need to <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201071\">enter into the fantasy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20109\">I feel like there\u2019s been a lot of self-awareness that\u2019s been developing lately for me and I\u2019m not sure what to attribute it to. If it\u2019s the fact that my wife\u2019s in France for a month, or that I\u2019ve got time to myself to reflect on things, if it\u2019s the exercise, or the structure that I\u2019m starting to develop. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201091\">I don\u2019t know what it is but...I guess that\u2019s about all I was going to say about that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s two things to pay attention to so that the idea, the what is it that prompts you to enter into the fantasy, but on the other end that the separation you also make even without the commercial telling you that this is a fantasy, don\u2019t actually attempt it. That\u2019s where your conscious <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B1\">choice comes in. You make a choice to leave it as a fantasy and not to attempt it. Whether it be driving your car on a train or engaging in behavior with me. You do. You make a conscious choice to leave it as fantasy and I think there\u2019s a piece where you can give yourself some credit. I know you often <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2010B2\">experience a lot of guilt about what the fantasy is, but giving yourself some credit for leaving it, appropriately, as a fantasy, can be added on to the idea of also letting go of the guilt and instead wondering what is it that makes it necessary? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2010F\">(12 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20111\">I think it\u2019s been, for me, a bit of a struggle with what I can control and feel guilty for things that I can\u2019t. That\u2019s something that I feel like I should be able to control. In the past I felt bad that even though you tell me that developing an attraction to a therapist is normal, it can happen, then <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201111\">it almost gives me license to exploit that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20113\">THERAPIST: What do you mean by exploit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20115\">CLIENT: Well, knowing that it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d. To not be very motivated to not enter into it. Do you know what I mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20117\">THERAPIST: Do you feel like you\u2019re supposed to be fighting against it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20119\">CLIENT: Well, I think that I have felt that. For me to sit here and to look at you and fantasize or get excited or whatever is\u2026 (7 second pause). Because I know it\u2019s normal makes it okay for me to do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011B\">I can\u2019t remember where I am now...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Letting go of the guilt because it\u2019s a common experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: Yes, yes. I guess then getting back to what I can control and what I can\u2019t control. Being something I choose not to control because I enjoy it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2011E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20121\">THERAPIST: I guess there\u2019s so many different layers of where you actually do have control and where you can try to have control. I think for me there\u2019s a separation between attraction, fantasy, and behavior. Attraction is a feeling and I think we have very little control over that\u2019s a reaction. There\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201211\">some layer of control over the thoughts, right? So, fantasy involves not just that reaction or emotion, but it also involves a lot of thought and scenarios that you might create in your head. A layer on top of that is actual behavior, acting out on that thought. I think you have very little control <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201212\">over the attraction, which is just a natural feeling that you have and who knows where that comes from. You do have control over how far you let those thoughts go, where you stop them from circling, and probably even more control over the behavior. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20123\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20125\">(10 second pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20127\">The other thing about that attraction is it\u2019s so deeply seated in this need for approval and it\u2019s almost like if I knew that you were attracted to me or whatever... It\u2019s almost like, \u201cOkay, I can move on.\u201d Or if I got feedback from someone else and I\u2014 That is still a struggle that I then go someplace <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201271\">else to try to figure out. It has nothing to do with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20129\">THERAPIST: Yes, that\u2019s where the work is, right? That\u2019s the meat of the work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B\">CLIENT: And we\u2019ve talked about this a lot before. What is happening at that moment that I seek into my need for acceptance? I think that\u2019s one of those things, on the weekend when I caught myself from trying to make myself \u201cSuper Bryce\u201d it was the same impulse, I guess. I also thought at one point\u2026 <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2012B1\">I applied for some job and it\u2019s like what behaviors do I want to curtail when and if I go back into a work environment? On that thing I made myself essential, essential, essential. And that\u2019s what I typically do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012D\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s somewhat adaptive in a work place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2012F\">CLIENT: It is, but I think it\u2019s also a bit unhealthy. It can be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20131\">THERAPIST: You need to set some limits. Making yourself valuable and essential in a workplace is adaptive, smart, good business sense, but you don\u2019t want to do that at the expense of all your other relationships and time and hobbies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20133\">CLIENT: Yes, I think that\u2019s the difference. In the past, my plugging into work has known no bounds. And so I think my worth in various arenas is being questioned, is being devalued. So, anyway... (sigh and 30 second pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20135\">THERAPIST: How is the relaxation, progressive muscle stuff going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20137\">CLIENT: It\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20139\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not. Do you want to practice? You\u2019ve got five minutes, do you want to practice in here or do you want to leave that off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013B\">CLIENT: I think I\u2019m going to add it to the documenting how my emotions are throughout the day (chuckle).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2013F\">CLIENT: I think part of the structure that I\u2019m trying to put in my day is also having the time. I know you said don\u2019t do this right before bed. That\u2019s not my plan, but to have at least a half hour to an hour to, kind of, reflect on the day and do things that can kind of bring me into closure for the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20141\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s not a \u201cdon\u2019t do it before bed\u201d, it\u2019s an \u201cit doesn\u2019t always have to be done before bed\u201d, so that you can learn to relax and to fall asleep. You want to learn to do both. Certainly it makes sense as a way to close your day, to let go of some stresses, when you become really proficient <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201411\">being able to do that at different times as well, is ideal. But, like you said, things need to be worked on in process. It doesn\u2019t have to be ideal all of the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20140-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20140-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561849\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20143\">CLIENT: Falling asleep hasn\u2019t really been a challenge.
