(pause) James is completely miserable when he\u2019s sick. It\u2019s very sad. Or I mean like, I don\u2019t know, he gets incapacitated more than I do.

And I\u2019ll see he\u2019s sick so he\u2019s kind of whiney and kind of doesn\u2019t really know what he wants. Yeah. (pause) So I\u2019m really tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">THERAPIST: And it\u2019s like also, a little comment here, being that your impulse was to sort of want to take care of me and check in about how I\u2019m doing -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">CLIENT: Oh, yeah, absolutely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">THERAPIST: But then it felt like you shouldn\u2019t do that and that\u2019s bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004F\">CLIENT: Yeah.

Yeah, I just (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">THERAPIST: I guess what strikes me is the sense of precariousness. And that seems, not for the same reasons, but similar with me and with James, as far as you describe. Like, I\u2019ve got to do it right. And this sort of a strong impulse and push to want to help and be there and take care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005B\">CLIENT: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005D\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20061\">THERAPIST: And it could lead to me falling apart or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20063\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it feels very much like stepping outside of, I mean both with you and with James, the way our relationship normally goes. So what I\u2019m really supposed to be doing and so, yeah, I feel like I\u2019m not going to get it right. (pause) Yeah. (pause) (sigh) But when I\u2019m talking about it it\u2019s like (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20062-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20062-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559825\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">You know, I get that I come to therapy to talk about myself but then when, then it turns to even asking how you are doing into talking about myself and that feels not right.

Like you sit and you talk and you eat, and then you can go like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200971\">beat each other up.\u201d Well not beat each other up, they don\u2019t actually They are actually really good in terms of they don\u2019t have much aggression problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20099\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009B\">CLIENT: It\u2019s really nice not to have to deal with.

And he was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009D\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2009F\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A1\">THERAPIST: (cross talking at 00:11:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P2-N200A3\">CLIENT: Yeah.

And so I was going through some of the poems with them and that one came up. And Keith (ph) told their Mom about that night. He was like, \u201cThere\u2019s a poem like Tanya.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh.\u201d And she asked me about it. She <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E51\">was like, \u201cWere you quite contrary as a child?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">And I was like, (whispers) \u201cWhat do I say here?\u201d (laughs) So I was like, \u201cWell, actually I was really depressed for a while when I was like five or six so, yes, I was very grumpy.\u201d And she was like, \u201cOh, what happened?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I \u201c Well, she asked like, \u201cDid you get treatment for it.\u201d And I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E71\">said, \u201cWell, I saw a therapist but nobody ever really acknowledge it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">That\u2019s a really roundabout way of saying, \u201cI \u201c I\u2019ve been wondering what was going on? Like, as always, because I go through phases of this, but do people know that it was this bad for me? (strained voice) Like, I definitely remember trying very hard not to let my therapist know that things were bad. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E91\">Like I didn\u2019t want to tell her about it.

And so I gave him a big hug and I said, \u201cI know it\u2019s really hard not to win. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2019D1\">And you\u2019re doing a really good job. This was a really good game.\u201d So he bounced back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A1\">CLIENT: And like as we were leaving he was like, \u201cWhy do you think you won?\u201d (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A3\">THERAPIST: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A5\">CLIENT: I was like, \u201cWell, you know, it happens sometimes. Sometimes one person wins and sometimes another person wins.\u201d I felt a little bit horrible, to be honest. I was like, \u201cThis was really a bad caretaking decision.\u201d (laughs) But I feel like better to get used to the idea now than have to run up <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201A51\">against it when he starts playing against his peers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201A9\">CLIENT: If he\u2019s like, \u201cI think I\u2019m better than you,\u201d to his friend, that\u2019s not going to go well. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AB\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AD\">CLIENT: It is hard to deal with the fact that (sigh) (pause) my childhood is over. (strained voice) Like I am never going to have been taken care of like that. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201AF\">THERAPIST: (inaudible at 37:02)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B1\">CLIENT: (coughs) Sorry. Swallowed wrong. (coughs) Thanks. (coughs) (pause) I have [no way to talk to my Dad] (ph) about this. Yeah. I\u2019m sort of interested in hearing what he would have to say. I sort of want to say like, \u201cWhat did you think was going on for me when I was a kid?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Uh huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B5\">CLIENT: But (pause) I don\u2019t I want to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that without making him feel bad.\u201d I guess sort of like, by definition, there\u2019s not really a way to do that without making him feel bad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B7\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. My Mom, it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all, actually. I mean, and not just because I didn\u2019t see her very much. You know, she\u2019s just not really a noticing sort of person. (pause) You know, as I\u2019ve said before, I don\u2019t think she has ever been able to see me other than as a version of herself. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201B91\">So, you know, and sometimes it\u2019s perfectly natural if I\u2019m depressed, so was she. It\u2019s as it should be. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N201B8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N201B8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559825\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201BB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

Also, it occurs to me that I don\u2019t think I mentioned, I\u2019m out I\u2019m in next week and I\u2019m in Monday and Tuesday the following week, but I\u2019m out Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
