I knew I had superpower. (both laughing) So \u2013 where do you start? I don\u2019t even know. Popping Advils. I haven\u2019t taken any Advil, but my head is spinning from all this shit. Yesterday my mom \u2013 I couldn\u2019t have planned this or predicted it any better \u2013 she spends the whole fucking <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">day with them until like 11:00 at night; then she gets flustered and angry with me that I called. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m done. You\u2019re mentally ill. You people are mentally ill.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">The funny thing is, deep down I knew this was going to happen and I knew that if I didn\u2019t do this, this is just the absurdist play. It\u2019s like a cycle that\u2019s just going to keep going. I said, \u201cNow you\u2019re forgetting all the shit you said yesterday? All the complaints you keep making? She said, \u201cWell that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">doesn\u2019t concern you. We can\u2019t just talk? We\u2019re talking. We\u2019re a family.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t be so exhausted and so whiny and complaining so much and then say, \u2018It\u2019s none of your business.\u2019 You can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m witnessing it. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m seeing what\u2019s going on day in and day <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">out. You\u2019re all mentally ill. You\u2019re all mentally ill. Because of your mental illness, you\u2019re not properly taking care of a sick woman.  You think you are, and you\u2019re not. I don\u2019t care how many times you took her to a coffee shop.\u201d She was like, \u201cToday I got her, I bathed her, I cut her nails.\u201d I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">like, \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit. That should be happening regularly, not like a victory after two months or whatever that you finally got her to do it. You\u2019re idiots. You\u2019re a bunch of fucking idiots. I\u2019m done with you. I\u2019m done.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Then, of course, today \u2013 this is the thing. This is why I\u2019ve got to get out of here. Today she knocks on my door. She\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m with you, son. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m on your side. I know it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d I just have to extricate. I think I have to let go of whatever this protectiveness thing is that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">I have with my mom, too, because she\u2019s an idiot. I have to accept the fact now that this is just what they are and my mom won\u2019t allow herself to have just some nice, peaceful retirement.  So I have to let it go and I have to accept the fact that it\u2019s affecting her health. She\u2019s being worn down. Other <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200112\">than what I\u2019ve done now, there\u2019s nothing I can do. And now it\u2019s like I\u2019m already a bad guy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">It\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s absolutely stunning. I was like, \u201cThe very sister you were saying all this shit about yesterday, now you\u2019re all \u2013\u201d They watched a movie together. You\u2019re freaks. You\u2019re absolute freaks. She was like, \u201cThis happens. Why does it concern you? Brothers and sisters fight and they make <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">up.\u201d No, this is not normal. If other families do this, then I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s not normal. This is not normal behavior. This is absolutely absurd. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: It sounds like \u201cmake up\u201d means more like pretending what happened yesterday didn\u2019t happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That, too. Thank you. Right. Instead of dealing head on \u2013 my uncle came over, too. I think they talked about nothing. My mom is like, \u201cOkay, your uncle said the ladies are going to come now and they\u2019re going to give her her medication.\u201d Again, it\u2019s like this piecemeal, half-assed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">\u2013 and then two weeks later something else will happen. My aunt will again lose a screw and she\u2019ll stop giving the medication. I was like, \u201cSo that\u2019s all going to happen while this fucking broad is living there? You\u2019re a bunch of idiots. You\u2019re a bunch of morons. Also, it\u2019s too late. You can get upset <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200172\">all you want, but it\u2019s in motion and this is probably not going to fly like this. The state \u2013 that\u2019s not acceptable care.\u201d  She was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell \u2013 believe it. You forced a grandchild to get involved because you\u2019re a bunch of idiots. There is nothing to talk about. You\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200173\">morons. I don\u2019t want have time for this anymore. I\u2019m leaving pretty soon. I\u2019m not leaving here until that woman is cared for properly, not this half-assed this week is like this; next week is like that. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Am I being too sensitive and over-involved? I guess so, but I don\u2019t care. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200174\">It\u2019s not sitting well with me. It\u2019s not right.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20016-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20016-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">THERAPIST: There are lots of idiots and morons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">CLIENT: There are lots of idiots and morons on this street probably. (pause)  Don\u2019t read into that. Because if that\u2019s the case then all my friends and me have the same problems. (laughs) It\u2019s a reality, right? There are a lot of idiots and morons in the world. I think it\u2019s finally okay for people to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B1\">say that. We\u2019re all supposed to act like we\u2019re all kind of the same, and we\u2019re not. There are a lot of people that, either because they\u2019re not helping themselves understand themselves better, deal with their issues, or they\u2019re just completely selfish assholes. There is a lot of that going around. It\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B2\">just a reality. You know it is when people are talking about it. Do you know what I mean? There is something in the air. Other people can do whatever they want and I\u2019ll just call them idiots, but when it\u2019s your family and when it\u2019s the majority of your family \u2013 it\u2019s one thing if there are two whack-jobs <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B3\">and one is like, \u201cOh, uncle is so nuts. No, no. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019re going to take care of grandma the right way.\u201d  When it\u2019s the majority your whole fucking life, these weirdos, then enough is enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I wonder. I guess I\u2019m saying to myself that I just wonder if there is something this experience holds. It\u2019s a parable, in a way, for your rage at them for being idiots and morons in much bigger and global ways your entire life. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not also [struck by] (ph?) the reality of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">CLIENT: No, this is the final straw and I feel like \u2013 wow. This is one thing I can actually maybe do something about. I don\u2019t know if I can. I guess if they drag their heels or whatever, then they\u2019ll just keep doing it this way. But at least I did my part because there is really nothing \u2013 after my grandmother <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">goes, what else can I take a stand about? Then it\u2019s just my mom and me. There is no one. This is it.  But yeah, it is a much bigger issue \u2013 including my mom \u2013 that yeah, they\u2019re idiots. Where do you start? Just the stupid things they\u2019ve done or haven\u2019t done when I\u2019ve suggested it. All that time I told <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F2\">my mom to save her money, to do it, and now she just bitches and moans, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I do it? I should have listened to you.\u201d It\u2019s just a very bad family. That\u2019s all I can say. Lots of families have lots of issues, but I see them. I have enough friends. I see people in their day-to-day lives and unless, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F3\">God forbid, there is illness, obviously stress happens; but overall I just look at these people and in their day-to-day lives they\u2019re not skipping down the street, but there is a consistency to their day-to-day lives. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20021\">These people; every day is a fucking roller coaster. And do you know what I realized just in the bathroom? Oh, I didn\u2019t tell you. On top of everything else I have a car issue. Now I have to spend like $600 because my car alarm is fucked up. I mean I have to fix it, so I was furious yesterday. I was <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200211\">like \u201con top of everything else?\u201d I started getting into that thing like \u201chave I done something in a past life?\u201d Do you know what I realized in the bathroom? It\u2019s not the world against me; it\u2019s my family against me. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. That is what\u2019s going on here because all of their idiotic <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200212\">things they have done and things they have not done that they should have done has made this family what it is. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting against. They could have had real careers. If they wanted money so much, fucking get off your ass, join the mainstream society, and fucking make money.  But now <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200213\">here we are and everything is bitching and moaning and bitching and moaning. That\u2019s not my problem. That\u2019s not my other cousin\u2019s problem. And yet, when my car doesn\u2019t work it\u2019s a trigger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20023\">It\u2019s almost as if if my family had done other things right, this moment wouldn\u2019t happen. I wouldn\u2019t be driving a 15-year-old car. I don\u2019t need to drive a Mercedes, but things would be a little more like stable like \u201cOh, the car is really old. Maybe I\u2019ll trade it in and get a new one.\u201d There would just <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200231\">be the normal things that people do, but we\u2019ve gotten to this point because people are idiots. And you can\u2019t say that to them, so the only thing I can do is just leave. I have to cut ties. I have to totally cut ties. There is no conversation that can take place, and that gives you a headache because <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200232\">the minute I say anything \u2013 \u201cMy God. What is all this blame? What did we ever do to you? We\u2019ve given you everything you ever wanted.\u201d Because what I\u2019m really asking them to do is face something they can\u2019t. That\u2019s what people like me do. We come here and spend years working on ourselves at a young age. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200233\">You can\u2019t expect a seventy-year-old woman, a sixty-year-old guy, to suddenly have an epiphanous . . . (pause) But yeah, I just realized that in the bathroom. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20025\">Every time something goes wrong for me, the rage is that what I\u2019m tracing is all the way back to how they\u2019ve done this. I didn\u2019t do this. They\u2019ve done this. I have bad credit? Well, you know what? You raise a kid properly, you teach them about finances, you \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 whatever you do. I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200251\">even know how normal people do it. They do something. I\u2019m going to do it with my kid.  Your kid wants to be whatever they want to be, you support them. You find a way to support them. You want to make money? Well, you fucking get off your ass, you start a business or whatever the fuck people do and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200252\">you make money. Then you shut the fuck up. I mean it\u2019s one thing after another. It\u2019s one thing after another.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20027\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s funny, because I think you and I ended up having in vivo sort of a live moment about how you\u2019re not coming into the session on Wednesday \u2013 snowstorm \u2013 and not canceling. It\u2019s a moment where what I\u2019m guessing is you\u2019re absorbed so much in this and enraged with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah. Again, they caused me to just not make a simple phone call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B\">THERAPIST: There is both the rage and, I think, also if that\u2019s been the history \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to describe this \u2013 you can get absorbed into something and forget external reality.  Then you don\u2019t make a phone call. I know this is hard to say out loud, but I charge people for the session if they don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2002B1\">call and cancel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002D\">CLIENT: No, I understand. Of course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2002F\">THERAPIST: So then that\u2019s $70 on you, which you don\u2019t have the money to pay for, and it\u2019s [the loss of what you need.] (ph?) I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s crossed your mind as we were having our conversation, but it\u2019s this cascading effect of negative effects in your life, then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20031\">CLIENT: You become a little nihilistic in these moments because you become like them. It\u2019s just \u2013 fuck it. It doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing matters. This shit keeps happening over and over. You get into this dark place and I\u2019m finally realizing that I think I have been over quite a long time. There is no <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200311\">dark place. These people just fuck me over non-stop.  I\u2019ve gotten the brunt of it because I\u2019m the oldest grandchild. I\u2019m the only child in my immediate family. It\u2019s just been layers of different avalanches of dysfunction with no reprieve anywhere. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a sibling to just vent to, a <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200312\">sibling I could talk to; \u201cListen, you\u2019re in college now so be careful \u2013 like credit cards and stuff.\u201d Siblings talk. Who knows if that would have happened. I\u2019m just saying there has been no older cousin to pull me aside and say, \u201cHey, man. Your dad died. Do you think packing your car and driving to <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200313\">San Francisco is the best idea?\u201d Do you know what I mean? Just nothing. One after the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20033\">So they can go fuck themselves. It\u2019s not enough and this conversation is one that can\u2019t take place. Language-wise it can\u2019t take place. I can\u2019t express it the right way in Assyrian. So it\u2019s over. It\u2019s over. I\u2019ve got to cut my losses.  I love my mom. When I lose her it\u2019s going to be absurd that this woman <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200331\">can\u2019t just let herself \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the word is \u2013 enjoy something. You\u2019ve got a house. You\u2019ve got a beautiful apartment, a house, amazing friends. I don\u2019t know why she can\u2019t . . . Some of it is just money. I get that. But I also know that even with the money, it\u2019s not like my mom would be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200332\">\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Italy.\u201d She just won\u2019t do the things that normal people do \u2013 go to the museum. The woman just won\u2019t do it, so I\u2019ve got to let it go. I\u2019ve got to let it go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20035\">THERAPIST: I think one of the things you\u2019re feeling, Brian, this kind of anger, is \u2013 we\u2019ve talked so much about the things that were done to you that were hurtful, but there are also the things that weren\u2019t done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20037\">CLIENT: Of course. Exactly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20039\">THERAPIST: The neglect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B\">CLIENT: Exactly. Some very simple things could have happened that didn\u2019t happen that led to this point. The other reason I can\u2019t bring this up, by the way, is because this is also a family all about money. So let\u2019s say my uncle who does, I can speak like this to him in English. Does he even know what <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B1\">my PhD is about? To him it\u2019s going to be like, \u201cShut the fuck up. Get a job. This country is all about \u2013 tough. Too bad. That\u2019s just the way it is. Let me tell you about when we came to this country.\u201d I can\u2019t win. They came to this country and he didn\u2019t know any English and he was fucking 15 or whatever <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B2\">and he rode his bike to the ESL school. He knew that it was all about money here and you\u2019ve just got to do business. Well, then I guess I should just hang myself.  They will never understand where I\u2019m coming from because I\u2019m not allowed to be this. This. I\u2019m not allowed to be it. No one is. No one in <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B3\">this country is allowed to be that. Only rich people are allowed to have choices and be artists and pursue their path. The rest of us are supposed to suck it up and be business people. If that\u2019s the case, what is there to talk about? On some level, it\u2019s the same with my mom. She\u2019s going to be like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2003B4\">\u201cNo one told you to study all these things and travel here and travel there.\u201d Okay. Well then, there is nothing to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003D\">THERAPIST: But the piece that I guess is missing in putting it in the \u201cit\u2019s the rich people against the poor people\u201d dichotomy is that what was neglected for you was guidance and help around thinking about how . . . <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2003F\">CLIENT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying there\u2019s nothing to talk about other than here or somehow channeling it other ways. This is a done deal. I mean I\u2019m done with these fucking people. I don\u2019t want to go to Thanksgiving. I don\u2019t want to go to Christmas. I\u2019m honestly done. I don\u2019t give a shit if that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200471\">bothers my mom and my uncle is hurt. They can just have a big circle of hurt. I\u2019m done because I\u2019m done faking it. I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t care what\u2019s happening with your mansions and your business. (chuckles) I mean you don\u2019t even know what my book is about, really. Who the fuck do you think you are? So <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200472\">I\u2019m just done. I\u2019m done.

Like yesterday, it was such a nice day. I was with my Assyrian buddies. We were going to have lunch. We go to the car and it\u2019s embarrassing. I mean yes, luckily I\u2019m with family so they can laugh and be like \u201caw, fuck.\u201d \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d \u201cBrian, this isn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F1\">your week, man. What the fuck?\u201d  I can also be myself in Assyrian. I was pissed. I was like, \u201cFuck this life.\u201d [ ] (inaudible at 00:20:07) is like, \u201cDude, what are you talking about? You\u2019ve got all those boobies to play with and stuff.\u201d They\u2019re so sweet and funny. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to Assyria, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2004F2\">man. You\u2019re going to be like president of Assyria within like a year.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20051\">It\u2019s just this moment of my God, what is this? What is this life? What is happening at this moment? Are you kidding me right now? My car alarm is just gone? It\u2019s like a metaphor for my life just blaring in the middle of the street. (chuckling) And now another expense and that\u2019s electrical. There\u2019s not <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200511\">a shit thing that my regular mechanic can do about that. You\u2019ve got to take it to the dealership. He\u2019s going to charge me what he\u2019s going to charge me right at the time that I need to buy my ticket to go to Assyria. So what happens is this general tension headache kicks in and I just don\u2019t want to play <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200512\">with boobies. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20050-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20050-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20053\">I literally don\u2019t have the energy to play with boobies right now. It\u2019s half funny, but I\u2019m being serious. I\u2019m even in a place where this one chick, the one who\u2019s really cool, this one girl I see, she text messaged me, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through all this. Do you know what would probably make <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200531\">it better?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat?\u201d She was like, \u201cTwo girls going down on you.\u201d (laughs) Now that\u2019s a cool chick. That\u2019s a perfect girl (laughing) who is attractive, but also a friend. That\u2019s like something a guy would say just to make you laugh and be kind of flirty. I appreciated it. It did make me feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200532\">better for a second, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m at; where even the thought of it, I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m just tired.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20055\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s really sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I\u2019m having trouble writing. I mean I\u2019m proud of myself; I keep trying to write, which is great. I\u2019m trying, but I can\u2019t do it. This is so much I don\u2019t know how to write. I\u2019m literally going to see my friend, that woman who I sometimes see for the writing. I told her, \u201cWe\u2019ve got <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200571\">to get together, but I have nothing to show you. I just need to ask you how to write non-fiction.\u201d I\u2019m so drained and overwhelmed. I keep starting and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying because it\u2019s so much.  (pause) (sighs) I don\u2019t know. The upside is I still feel very liberated. I feel like I ran a marathon <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200572\">and then I got into a boxing ring and I\u2019m out on the other side. Yeah, my head hurts and I feel battered, but I also feel liberated. I feel like I see things even extra-lucid right now even more than a few days ago. It is what it is. My mom is going to die sometime soon-ish, right? She\u2019s 72. Even if <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200573\">she lives until 92, which I really hope she does, this is the way she\u2019s going to be; so I can\u2019t keep being sensitive for her and protective for her. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20059\">I kind of don\u2019t feel like going to Assyria, but I\u2019m forcing myself. It\u2019s like going to the gym. I feel like I have to see this through for whatever reason. There is nothing for me here. I need to extricate myself from these people. I don\u2019t have the money to do it. I don\u2019t want to move to Ohio, so in <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200591\">a way I am running away isn\u2019t the right word, but . . . (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005B\">THERAPIST: [It\u2019s like losing your family] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, because things are half-assed. How much money am I going to go to Assyria with? Almost nothing. That\u2019s not a good feeling. This job doesn\u2019t start until the fall. I don\u2019t know yet about summer teaching. I\u2019m literally going just because every single person there is telling me to just get <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2005D1\">there and there will be work. Well, that\u2019s great, but that\u2019s risky and scary because that\u2019s it. Then when I come back I either have to beg \u2013 not beg \u2013 but ask friends to crash with them. This is it. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2005C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2005C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2005F\">THERAPIST: This feels like kind of, again, the story, the parable about breaking ties. That\u2019s what Assyria is going to be about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20061\">CLIENT: Yeah. Part of me is telling myself just don\u2019t be hard on myself. Think of it initially as a vacation. This has been like the worst eight months. In some ways, very good because of this. I\u2019m so in a different place, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20063\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s been painful. Hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. On top of being broke and this and that, it\u2019s been a nightmare. Part of me is like dude, just go and think of it like hey, man \u2013 I\u2019m going to Assyria. It\u2019s a vacation\/exploratory time. Just go and fucking enjoy it. You have these friends there and people want you to do well there and you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200651\">have a job lined up.  Yeah, if worse comes to worse comes to worse you\u2019re going to come back and you\u2019re going to ask friends to crash with them for a while because I\u2019m not staying with my mom. That\u2019s just not going to happen. That\u2019s not the worst thing in the world. It happens all the time. It\u2019s just <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200652\">that right now I\u2019m not excited about anything. I\u2019m just drained. Yesterday this really cool chick \u2013 she\u2019s so attractive \u2013 she was like, \u201cI\u2019ll just come over and we can talk, sexual stuff or whatever, but you can just tell me all about it.\u201d It\u2019s exhausting to even tell someone about. Where do you start <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200653\">with this shit? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20067\">THERAPIST: You see this as taking a break from them, not as cutting them out of your life \u2013 your family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20069\">CLIENT: No, when I say a break, I mean in general. This is a cut. I am cutting ties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006B\">THERAPIST: What I mean is like never speaking to them again?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D\">CLIENT: No, no. Not that way. I just mean that \u2013 I would never do that to my mom. Why? Because I\u2019m a normal, rational human being with empathy and compassion. My mom has been through a lot in her life and no matter what, I know how much she loves me. The woman does. I also do, these days, give her credit. <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D1\">That was a big deal this morning. She\u2019s concerned. She gave me the keys to her car. She gave me a huge check to take care of this airline ticket (sniggers) without knowing what\u2019s going on with my car.  She hugged me. She was like, \u201cI\u2019m on your side.\u201d I will never cut ties with her. What I am saying, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D2\">though, is the rest of the family, other than my cousin \u2013 no interest. They can call me if they want, but I have no interest anymore in pretending anything, so if I do see them, if I do whatever, I\u2019m not going to ask them a goddamned thing about how they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t give a shit. And when they <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D3\">ask me, I\u2019ve got nothing to say because they\u2019re asking me is completely hollow. You know when someone really means it. They just love you. They\u2019re your family. They\u2019re asking you \u201chow are you?\u201d Okay, great. Well, I\u2019m here. I guess I\u2019m good. They know nothing about me. They\u2019ve never known shit about <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006D4\">me and have never made effort to know shit about me, so they can go fuck themselves. I guess what I mean is more of an estrangement. It\u2019s not really cutting ties. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Yes, so another way of putting it, maybe, is trying to break yourself from looking to those family members for something different than what they are able to do, which is limited, and coming to terms with whatever will happen to them is limited in its real emotional contact. It will be a <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2006F1\">surface pleasantry that doesn\u2019t go beyond that, which is really sad. But what is freeing about it is that you won\u2019t be having to continue beating your head against the wall, like beating a dead horse, looking for the thing that you\u2019ll never get.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2006E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2006E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20071\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20073\">THERAPIST: But it\u2019s sad. (pause) (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20075\">CLIENT: Today I\u2019m going to do the ticket thing, I think. The thing is when it\u2019s so open-ended, you don\u2019t even know what day should it be? It could be mid-March; it could be late March. It could be early April; it could be early March. I can\u2019t wrap my head around when it should be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20077\">THERAPIST: I wonder about that, if there is any reason to talk to the department again about whether coming at a certain time would make it more likely for you to get an appointment right away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20079\">CLIENT: That\u2019s been made very clear, though. They\u2019re very excited for me to be there as soon as possible. When I told them March they were like, \u201cThat\u2019s so perfect.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Do you know when their spring semester starts, for example?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007D\">CLIENT: There will be no work in the spring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2007F\">THERAPIST: So summer would be the earliest?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20081\">CLIENT: Summer, yes. But again, the thing is from her all the way to all my other friends they\u2019re like, \u201cDude, there is work. There is work to do. It\u2019s just you\u2019ve got to be there. There is plenty of work.\u201d So I\u2019m going on that and I\u2019m going on getting part of the rent from the third floor. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200811\">if that pays my rent there, which it will, all I need is a couple of bucks to just get me started.  The thing is, I\u2019ve put together my writing portfolio. I went back and there was a magazine in the late \u201880\u2019s up through the \u201890\u2019s, but in the early \u201890\u2019s I was their Darien correspondent. It was like <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200812\">a Time Magazine, a very fancy thing, about Assyria, in English, about the Assyrian world. I was like, dude, what am I doing? Where are those articles? Luckily these people have archived them all online. I went through each of them. I went through the months and was like, \u201cHere\u2019s one.\u201d I\u2019m going to make <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200813\">a writing portfolio and start trying to get free-lance. That\u2019s kind of a big deal that I\u2019ve started a magazine. I\u2019m an editor for a journal. I\u2019m a published writer. That\u2019s got to be something. (chuckles) This is ridiculous.  So I got those at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20083\">THERAPIST: Is all that stuff on your CD? It is? All the articles you\u2019ve written?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20085\">CLIENT: What I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve tried to condense things, so instead of saying all the articles I just said \u201cDarien correspondence, a magazine.\u201d What I\u2019m doing is I have a website for my music. That\u2019s become like a one-size-fits-all website, and I\u2019ll add that. I have my poetry linked. My CD is a good <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200851\">CD \u2013 BBC interviews, the book. I don\u2019t know what else I\u2019m supposed to do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20087\">THERAPIST: But this would allow the actual writing samples . . ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20089\">CLIENT: Yeah, like people will be \u201cthere is a free landscape, but we need to see a writing portfolio.\u201d Well, here you go. I\u2019ve done two or three blog posts; links to that. I\u2019m actually being pretty productive, it\u2019s just that this is a final . . . I just need to be away from these people and, I think, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200891\">from this. (sighs) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008B\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ll need to give some thought to what we\u2019ll do and in what form, because I think that\u2019s really important that if something is going to change in some way, you have some time knowing what it is going to change to, metabolizing that or trying that on for size. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N2008A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2008A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562572\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2008D\">CLIENT: It wouldn\u2019t be good if it\u2019s just a cold-turkey kind of situation.

It has been a stretch carrying the weeks when you can\u2019t pay that. It has an effect. I don\u2019t know if, for example, there is something \u2013 <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F1\">we could certainly figure out a way of doing a phone session potentially, a Skype session. With Skype I\u2019m still a little bit [infantile] (ph?) about a video Skype. That\u2019s not something I historically feel comfortable with. I Skype with people but use the audio Skype, so it\u2019s a free phone call. We can <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N2008F2\">talk about that another time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20091\">CLIENT: Part of the finances would be, hopefully, that that\u2019s part of this thing, right? I\u2019ll be in a completely different situation. First, it wouldn\u2019t be three days a week anyway, so I could try to make a bigger dent in what I owe and kind of go from there. That\u2019s the plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20093\">THERAPIST: That makes some sense to me that it makes sense to not be continuously during the three times a week until you get . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20095\">CLIENT: Of course. That\u2019s impossible. And that wouldn\u2019t feel good anyway. It would almost be counterproductive. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20097\">THERAPIST: Pay some of this down and we can sort of figure out from there what number makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20099\">CLIENT: Exactly. Before I go or when I get there, whatever it is, once I know there is a certain income coming in I can just automatically be like every week paying this much to Claire and don\u2019t think about it.  Just make a dent. Then by that time we\u2019ll figure it out. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009B\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s something to think about, though, even if it means going down to once a week. I\u2019m don\u2019t know if you\u2019re picturing . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009D\">CLIENT: I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying. Once a week, you mean, before I go?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2009F\">THERAPIST: No. I foresee wanting to keep this up after you leave, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A1\">CLIENT: I guess my thought was after I go . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Take a break? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A5\">CLIENT: I\u2019m assuming. At least until I get there. Okay I\u2019m here; I have WiFi. (laughs) We can make a free phone call. I can tell you I\u2019m here and if this is crazy or whatever or it\u2019s awesome and this is how much I think I\u2019m going to be making. That would make sense. Otherwise, that\u2019s not fair to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A7\">THERAPIST: You\u2019d be digging a deeper hole for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s not fair to you and for me it\u2019s therapy, but I\u2019m constantly worried about it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AB\">THERAPIST: That makes sense. (pause)  We have next week and the following week is the week I\u2019m away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AD\">CLIENT: The whole week?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200AF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m here Monday, Tuesday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B1\">CLIENT: Thanks, Claire. Have a good weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200B3\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
