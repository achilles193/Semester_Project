You should call Harold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: Just because there's a note in my folder, if that even still exists, that's like, Fred just needs to finish a math credit, and then he gets his degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Of course it's still there, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: I hope so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well, I don't...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: It was written by the dean.

Last time I called was a few years ago to hear about that, and the woman that was behind the desk was very rude to me, like, no such thing has ever happened. I was like, you need to go through the dean, because I know I have this. And it was a new <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">dean. He was like, yeah, I see the note here, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2004D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I'm like, okay, great.

[0:02:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20055\">CLIENT: No, there's one class, one math class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20057\">THERAPIST: Is that it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah, that's all I've got to do.

Luckily I have a 3% interest rate, because I locked it in years ago. But yeah, it's like $360 a month, I think, (inaudible at 0:03:29) just for the past ten years. More than that now. No, actually about ten years, because I was deferred and everything until I got a job <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200651\">at Melody, now I'm sort of paying regularly. So it's a pain in the ass, but pay those off until I'm 65, and then I'm good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: It's the best deal going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: Yeah, it actually is.

House was a great (inaudible at 0:04:01), house and student loans. Boom. I just need to start making money.

With the savings, there's actually some time. It's good. But that's good. I'm like, okay, I can keep looking. I'm not screwed. I'm not going to lose the house right away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Yeah.

I'm like, I still think of myself the way I thought of myself all those years ago. It's weird, though, dude.

I should really be spending four hours a day just making stuff. If I spent four hours a day just making stuff, if I spent two hours a day just making stuff, I would make so much stuff. It's all stuff I want to make. There's all these clever ideas and things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200C11\">And I was thinking of just... I have all those park (ph) assets from back doing Koala Crash (ph), you've got all those animals and the various animation.

Or is my subconscious <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200CD1\">(ph) just simply set in its path as it learned to make all these choices in the following ways, and now I simply sit back and watch, as I express desire?

I've seen this with people who go through stretches of unemployment. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D31\">They look back and they go (sighing), I wish I would have taken that time to really...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D5\">CLIENT: Do something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D7\">THERAPIST: Do something with it. And it's something about the business of being in the midst of unemployment that really is hard and is unappreciated. (Chuckling) Just a quick story. This guy I know got laid off from some investment bank. He was an investment banker. They gave him a severance package <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200D71\">that was two years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200D9\">CLIENT: Jesus.

At the end of the two years, the same company says, we want to hire you back. So he basically lived for free...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E1\">CLIENT: For two years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E3\">THERAPIST: For two years, but did not enjoy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E5\">CLIENT: Did not enjoy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E7\">THERAPIST: And he like, oh my God. (Laughing) What I could have done with those two years!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200E9\">CLIENT: Right, what you could have done with two years rather than being so stressed out about it. There's something to that, I think. If I stopped being so worried about being unemployed and started making stuff, I would actually... I've got so many skills that are monetizable, so many skills which <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200E91\">are monetizable.

You get really invested <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2016D1\">in these games. I mean, the characters are very well animated. [They're motion cap] (ph), and they're very well animated, to the point where there are flickers of reality watching these CGI characters. And just flickers of your brain is fooled.

They go find a warm, dark, moist place to die. And so the bug walks over to that place and lies down and dies. And then the spores spread from his corpse. So anyways in this game, that's the whole spread. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201811\">And it starts eroding your morality very quickly. They make you really aggressive, and then it comes out through your eyes to the point where you can't see. So you use echo location, and then after that some people get really huge and dangerous. So they end up different types of zombies essentially. <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201812\">And you're fragile, you're incredibly fragile. [0:20:53] If you need to heal yourself, you use a first aid kit, and that takes time. There's no way to stop the action except for pausing it outright. There's no way to actually... some of the games sort of pause, change around inventory items, then go <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201813\">back. You actually drop your backpack to the ground in this game, start rummaging through it looking for what you need. And this all takes time, so you can't only kill yourself in the middle of combat.

[0:21:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: And the first 20 minutes of this game are basically just walking and running. It's some of the best walking and running I've ever done in a video game, absolutely amazing, this feeling of, something is wrong...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018D\">CLIENT: Because it happens the night the thing starts. You're playing his daughter in the first ten minutes of the game. You're playing his 14-year-old daughter looking through an empty house for your father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018F\">THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20191\">CLIENT: Yeah. And eventually you switch over to him as he carries her through the woods as (ph) they run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20193\">THERAPIST: Wow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20195\">CLIENT: But then she gets shot and killed by a soldier, and you sit there, tears in your eyes as you watch this man hold his daughter's corpse and beg her not to die.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20197\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20199\">CLIENT: And then it skips forward 20 years. And... yeah. [0:22:55] And then so he has to watch this other 14-year-old girl. But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019B\">THERAPIST: He was to watch his own 14-year-old girl die?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019D\">CLIENT: He has to watch this other 14-year-old girl as his charge. So he has to escort her from place to place. And so the parallels between his daughter and this girl are stark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2019F\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, it's another one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A1\">CLIENT: (Crosstalk) yeah, he has to go... so his daughter dies. And 20 years later he has to escort this (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A3\">THERAPIST: This other 14-year-old girl, okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A5\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it's really good storytelling. It's never like, my daughter died and blah blah blah. He doesn't spell it out. You're like... but the symbolism is clear here so we wouldn't have to get it spelled out for us. (Pause) Yeah, really good. Anyway, really good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A7\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A9\">CLIENT: And I really like the aspect of him caring for this 14-year-old girl who becomes more and more independent as time goes on, as she evolves, because for the longest time she's asking for a gun. She's like, you've got to give me a gun. And I'm like, I'm not going to give you a gun, until she actually <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201A91\">saves your life by grabbing the gun you dropped and shooting the guy. [0:23:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N201A8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N201A8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560009\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: And you're like, okay, now you can have a gun. And once you give her a gun she starts doing stuff. Like, you'll be sneaking past the dude, and she'll leap on his back with a shiv and just stab him in the neck. And she's a 14-year-old girl hanging off the back of this huge dude, just like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: And I'm just like so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. It's amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: Huh. Yeah, her coming into her own and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. And becoming independent and then having her own power...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: And also seeing that respect. And she's 14, but she's 14 that... she's grown up in an apocalypse. There's never not been this broken world as far as she's concerned. She's 14 years old, these things have been going on for 20. But... so she's really mature for her age in some ways at (ph) stuff <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B91\">that you wouldn't expect in a video game. And she saves his life, and he's really gruff about it. He's like, I told you to stay where you were, and the whole thing. And you shouldn't have gone out there. She's like, no. That's not going to be e-fucking-nough (sp?) for me. [0:24:56] She's like, how about, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201B92\">hey, I realize it's really hard for you. But it was obviously him or me, so thanks for saving my life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: What did the guy say to her?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: He was just really gruff. He's like, you should have stayed where you were, you shouldn't have come out here...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: Oh, okay, uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: And [that's just really] (ph)... she's like, no. I saved your life, and you need to...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Acknowledge that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: You need to acknowledge that. She's like, I just killed someone. I've never killed someone before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Mmm. Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: And just that sort of thing never happened in video games. You never see a character have to acknowledge and then deal with this sort of stuff. Sometimes it's like, oh, wow, I just killed someone. Puke. But this is actually... there's an investment here. Like, no, that was difficult (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CB\">THERAPIST: Well, I can see why the (crosstalk) really resonates for you...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CD\">CLIENT: (Chuckling) Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201CF\">THERAPIST: It's like... God, it's got aspects of Eva (sp?) that you've been talking about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D1\">CLIENT: Yeah, certainly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D3\">THERAPIST: Girls coming into their own, being... walking a line between innocence and kind of worldliness and needing to... [0:26:03]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D7\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) And needing it to be... the power to be recognized in some way? Something about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D9\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) And so I play that, and I play Mage Knight. And I make incremental progress toward solving problems. But ultimately I'm not being super creative. And this game of Mage Knight is a board game, which [I have a PC model of. I can play it] (ph) on the PC for free, which is nice. It's <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D91\">a game that takes between two and five hours depending on how long you're going to sit down and play it. And it's a sort of puzzle essentially, where you're this mage knight in this fantasy here thing. And you move across this board that you discover is different every time. [0:26:54] And you gather <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201D92\">these resources which change how you can play your character. Every turn is this new individual puzzle inside of a larger puzzle.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N201D8-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201D8-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560009\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB\">THERAPIST: Jeez. One thing I'm thinking about is that you describe it as... playing these games as like going into a shell. I think it is in the sense that it's a world... it's a realm protected by the snarkiness, the criticism. And that can often feel like a... I mean, I was thinking, it's not just <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201DB1\">these criticisms and whatever that you deal with. But it's got a kind of a zombie kind of apocalypse kind of feel. It's like a... people are... can be cruel, and especially when they're...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DD\">CLIENT: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201DE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201DF\">THERAPIST: I mean, there's the whole reality of what happens in social media.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E1\">CLIENT: Yeah, anonymity, right. (inaudible at 0:27:54) Internet asshat theory, which is, a normal person plus anonymity equals total asshat. Yeah. [0:28:01]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E3\">THERAPIST: Total. Yeah. And people will say these things and really try to hit you hard and...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E5\">CLIENT: Yeah. Well, and with Twitter now, it's like, this is who you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E7\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201E8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201E9\">CLIENT: This is who you are.

In some way you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201ED\">CLIENT: Well, to a degree, but, I mean, what... you also become incredibly accountable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201EE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201EF\">THERAPIST: Oh, I meant the snark that the people that are attacking...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F1\">CLIENT: Oh, sure. Yeah, that's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F3\">THERAPIST: But yeah, no (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F5\">CLIENT: Well... (Pause) So someone says something racist or horrible on Twitter. And so then you retweet it with a comment like, can you believe this shit?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F7\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201F9\">CLIENT: And now thousands of people are looking at this racist asshole...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FD\">CLIENT: And going, what the fuck is wrong with you, and calling them out on it. And people are stupid in getting caught for stuff. There was this woman in Scotland who was driving down a road in her car. [0:28:56] And there were a bunch of bicyclists, and she hit one. And she keeps driving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N201FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N201FF\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20200\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20201\">CLIENT: And she tweets about it.

There's always some number of reasons. But then it's, yeah, a couple paragraphs per reason. And they're really funny. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20232\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20233\">THERAPIST: No, I see what you're saying, though, that the critic is not taking the chance that the creative is. [0:31:01] The...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20234\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20235\">CLIENT: Sure, the critic is just doing the easy thing. Like, ah, here's things wrong with your stuff. And... but again it's that problem of... there's a difference. It's like, I also make films. And I think your film is not very good. And then there's, I did not enjoy this film. I thought the pacing <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202351\">was bad. I thought the acting was subpar. And so that's one thing, to be like, I can see... I know enough about this medium to see this was not really well performed. Then there's, this movie was okay. It's like, you're saying that because it was incredibly popular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20236\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20237\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20238\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20239\">CLIENT: This is more of your hipster nonsense. Like, oh, well, Citizen Kane is better. No, it's not. It's not. Citizen Kane was amazing when it came out. It blew out minds. Like, oh, wow, Citizen Kane, amazing. But that movie is really old now. It's not better than new stuff that's coming out. It just isn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023B\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) [0:31:58]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023D\">CLIENT: The pacing is awful. The acting is subpar by today's standards. The camera work, while brilliant for the time, is now just really old. So it's a great movie historically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2023E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2023F\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20240\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20241\">CLIENT: It's a groundbreaking film, and we should study it and see why it changed the things it changed. But it's like Tolkien. Tolkien's amazing. Tolkien was an imaginative motherfucker. But as a writer he was really plodding and heavy-handed. And at the time the first acknowledged fantasy novel besides <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N202411\">the Book of Mormon just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20242\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20243\">THERAPIST: Hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20244\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20245\">CLIENT: Yeah, well, yeah. The first fantasy novel... the first American fantasy novel is the Book of Mormon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20246\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20247\">THERAPIST: Wow. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20248\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20249\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:32:53] So... but really his books aren't very good. I tried reading them. Halfway through The Two Towers I'm like, this is awful. I'm like, this is just awful. I do not care for this. The movies were really good though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024A\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024B\">THERAPIST: Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024C\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024D\">CLIENT: And Tolkien's son or grandson or whatever is aghast at what Peter Jackson has done with the movies. But he's like, oh, he's changing. I'm like, actually, you know what, he is. And he's changing... he's making them his own. He's making Lord of the Rings his own story now. And I can see how it <\/span><span data-id=\"P10-N2024D1\">would piss off a lot of people, but he's making great movies, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N2024E\"><span data-id=\"P10-N2024F\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P10-N20250\"><span data-id=\"P10-N20251\">CLIENT: And they tell the story in a better way in some cases. So [it's a good fan] (ph). He made a book shorter than the first book in Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, into a trilogy. It's amazing.

It's just it was buried under all this... and here's what the mountain range looked like. And here's what the forest was like. And the leaves had the following quality to them.

He tries to steal it from Frodo to use its power for his own best intentions, which would then become the (inaudible at 0:35:51). <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202851\">And he has a moment of weakness where he tries to steal it from Frodo.

What'd you say?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2028C\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2028D\">CLIENT: Sean Bean dies in everything he's in.

It's like, oh, well, Boromir fought them, and they shot him with arrows, and he died. And you're like, what the fuck is this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P11-N202991\">man? And look at how Peter Jackson imagines it. And you're like, that's cool. That's really cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N2029A\"><span data-id=\"P11-N2029B\">THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.

That's interesting, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A0\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A1\">CLIENT: And that sorrow, disappointment, when he knows he's not going to be able to stop them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P11-N202A2\"><span data-id=\"P11-N202A3\">THERAPIST: That... yeah, that's the key, right?

She's like, yeah, I snowboarded down Mount Doom. And she's like, it's funny. They had to add a lot of CGI rocks to it in the movies.

[0:38:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202B8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202B9\">CLIENT: But that's... the point being that there are people who hold onto past instances of an art form, and they're like, this is still amazing. And I think it's important to say, no, that was amazing. And we should study it for those reasons. Why was it amazing? What made it amazing at the time? What <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202B91\">did we learn from that? What did that teach us about the medium? That's great, that's important. Study Citizen Kane in film school.

The Pyramids are amazing, and we don't know how they built them. But they did. But do we want to build them? No. Pyramids were amazing. Look at those, study those, figure out what they did.

If you're kind of... (Pause) If you're too loyal to the old, it seems like it's more of a retreat from the new, from doing something new and creative, from expanding, <\/span><span data-id=\"P12-N202C71\">from... and it's almost offensive in a way. [0:39:54] What you're sort of saying is... it seems to me is, there's... we're in a world now that that's the past. We're moving forward, and we're wanting to try to create new...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202C8\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202C9\">CLIENT: And there will be new, better things, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CB\">THERAPIST: But there's always going to be the critics of those things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202CC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202CD\">CLIENT: Well, right. But people who are like, oh, this other thing is cooler. And that's not criticism.

I had this brilliant idea first. Good, you did, fantastic. Now we all need to use that and build from that (inaudible at 0:40:37) thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DA\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DC\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DD\">CLIENT: But I own this idea. Oh, do you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202DE\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202DF\">THERAPIST: It's more posturing than it is criticism, right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P12-N202E0\"><span data-id=\"P12-N202E1\">CLIENT: Yeah.

So if that top wobbled that means it was going to fall down eventually. So boom, you showed it wobbling. Clearly he's awake. [0:42:55] Or we <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N203151\">look at the fact that he's like, never let anyone else touch your focus. But numerous people have touched his focus. It's not even his focus.

He shows you the entire thing, how it's happening in real time. <\/span><span data-id=\"P13-N2031D1\">He shows that. That's not confusing.

All your memories are memories of memories. The ones you maintain are the ones you make a memory (ph), which is why I'm so irritated with people that don't (ph) remember something was my idea. [0:44:55] I'm like, you don't think about me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20336\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20337\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Oh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20338\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20339\">CLIENT: You thought about the idea and the way you felt about it. In some cases you reassigned it to yourself.

People will be like, why do you care so much about getting credit for your ideas? I'm like, okay, well, you should know who has good ideas, because you need to go back to that person for good ideas. And Melody used <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2033D1\">to do this all the time, like, I don't really remember whose idea this was. I'm like, it was me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2033E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2033F\">THERAPIST: Jeez. How about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20340\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20341\">CLIENT: It's important to remember whose idea these things are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20342\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20343\">THERAPIST: Otherwise it is... it kind of represents they're not thinking about...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20344\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20345\">CLIENT: Yeah, it's like, where did this knowledge come from?

Fred's had a bunch of good ideas. We should go see what he says to say about this. Maybe he'll have more great ideas, as opposed to, we have good ideas, but I don't know where they come from. Let's just hope that they keep coming to us. Fucking idiocy is <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N203491\">what it is. [0:45:54] And I can't believe they're trying to get back to Melody sometimes. I'm looking at it today, I'm like, I left Melody four years ago, and I've tried to go back multiple times in really desperate moves in some cases. And I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why? Why am I going back?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2034A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2034B\">THERAPIST: Mmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2034C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2034D\">CLIENT: As Darcy (ph) says, do you remember why you broke up with that crazy girl?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2034E\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2034F\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20350\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20351\">CLIENT: It's like, yeah, sure, the sex was good. But didn't you hate her? Didn't she drive you insane? I'm like, she did. I did hate her. She did drive me insane. But Melody goes on, and they make... continue to make beautiful things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20352\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20353\">THERAPIST: Hmm. No, there's something still there about that crazy girl or whatever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20354\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20355\">CLIENT: Yeah, still crazy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20356\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20357\">THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N20358\"><span data-id=\"P14-N20359\">CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't care for that very much. (Pause) [0:46:57] Yeah, but the appearance of intelligence, and I really disrespect that. (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2035A\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2035B\">THERAPIST: What were you thinking then?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P14-N2035C\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2035D\">CLIENT: Just I know this guy who for years was at Melody. (inaudible at 0:47:08) so... but he was at Melody when I get there. He was actually the guy who let me know about the job and helped me get my foot in the door, which was great. And he kind of told me how to present myself in the interview because <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2035D1\">of what they were looking for. So I did. And that was great. But this guy was really irritating me because, one, he was rude. His way was just like, oh, I'm going to insult you a little bit every time we meet. But I'm going to smile while I do it. I'm like, no, you're still just insulting me. Well, <\/span><span data-id=\"P14-N2035D2\">it was actually though... he was like, oh, I see this is... like, yeah, you're still an asshole.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P14-N2035C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"13\"><span data-id=\"P14-N2035C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":15,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560009\" data-realpage=\"15\" data-page=\"15\">\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2035E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2035F\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20360\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20361\">CLIENT: And he had this look on his face like, oh God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20362\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20363\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [0:47:55]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20364\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20365\">CLIENT: Like, I'm not going to fuck around with you (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20366\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20367\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling) I'm not going to play this game with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20368\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20369\">CLIENT: Yeah, if you're being the asshole, let's play you're being an asshole.

And this was... he would find words to use, buzzwords. He'd be like, oh yeah, so what's this [platform agnostic] (ph)? I'm like, that's not really... (Pause) Fine. And then people started using that phrase. Like, oh, I guess we're all <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N2036D1\">using platform agnostic now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2036E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2036F\">THERAPIST: It sounds smart (crosstalk).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20370\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20371\">CLIENT: Yeah, it sounds intelligence. Well, I'm like, admittedly... he's like, admittedly? I'm like, yeah, it's a word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20372\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20373\">THERAPIST: Is that right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20374\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20375\">CLIENT: Yeah. He's like, what are you...? Admittedly? I'm like, yeah, that's a word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20376\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20377\">THERAPIST: Wow.

He was like, oh, I'll offer an insight, which again was somebody <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203791\">else's insight. [0:49:00] It was like, oh, well this thing somebody else thought of or said or whatever...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2037A\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2037B\">THERAPIST: Well, there is something about the...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2037C\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2037D\">CLIENT: Platitude, platitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N2037E\"><span data-id=\"P15-N2037F\">THERAPIST: What you found at Melody and I think in other places, was that a certain kind of smooth operator could overcome a lot of substance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20380\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20381\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20382\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20383\">THERAPIST: And... yeah, there's some way that a social... the way you present yourself or something has a lot of...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20384\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20385\">CLIENT: Well, and you know, a few months before he got laid off...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20386\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20387\">THERAPIST: Oh, he did? He got laid off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P15-N20388\"><span data-id=\"P15-N20389\">CLIENT: Yeah. I was sitting there at Melody with Kim, who he was reporting up through. And she was like, oh, I'm (inaudible at 0:49:47). And I turned to her, and I'm like, what is he good at? (Pause) And she thought about it. And she's like, I guess he's good at looking at large amounts of information <\/span><span data-id=\"P15-N203891\">and summarizing them. (Pause) [0:49:56] And that was it.
