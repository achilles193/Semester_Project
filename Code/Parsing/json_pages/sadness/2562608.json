Thank you. Oh, that\u2019s right. I was a little confused at first. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t come in for a few reasons. The marathon was one of them. It\u2019s also hard to get here from my house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Oh okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Often many of the routes are closed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Oh really? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to get around. A lot of the roads are closed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Oh. (PAUSE) I had kind of a weird conversation with my mom last week. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">I think it was kind of triggered by... We were just sitting with some friends and I don\u2019t know how but the subject of being beaten by parents came up or something. And I was quite at first (inaudible at 00:04:23) suddenly, I was like very mad. Suddenly, I recalled this one beating I got from my dad <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200291\">for stealing money from like the house. I had stolen like five rupees and... (PAUSE) Yeah. So... (PAUSE) I guess I was telling my friends like, \u201cOh, it was horrible and I hate it and...\u201d (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">I think she was talking about just how like the dynamics in her family and with her brother and like how she defended him and stuff. Like her dad once beat her brother and she kind of went around her father. She said it was like to get him to stop beating her brother. And I was just like (inaudible <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B1\">at 00:05:29) for some reason. I don\u2019t remember what made me recall that incident. But I was like, \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think I deserved the punishment I got and like...\u201d (PAUSE) And my mom was like, \u201cYeah, sorry to bring this up but... I\u2019m not trying to say you did a bad job bringing me up but this is... <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B2\">Really, I don\u2019t approve of this.\u201d And she kind of she... So, she started to tell the story too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">She was like, \u201cWell, you said...\u201d Or she was telling my friend or whatever, \u201cCecelia (ph) said that she was going to bring home some cakes and like it was her friend\u2019s birthday and...\u201d So I was like, \u201cOh, I guess you\u2019re trying to...\u201d So I just remember the way that she would tell the story is very different <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">from the way that I would tell the story. Like I feel, when she\u2019s telling the story, she\u2019s like, \u201cLook at what a big old liar you were when you were like five or six.\u201d You can just fabricate things. (LAUGHTER) Like, \u201cYou completely duped us into thinking, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s your friend\u2019s birthday. You\u2019re bringing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">these cakes,\u2019 while, you know, all the time, behind our backs, you\u2019re like stabbing us in the back, stealing our money.\u201d (LAUGHTER) It wasn\u2019t like a lot of money. Like I didn\u2019t get any pocket money or anything like most of my friends did and, you know, it was lonely. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">Every single day it was tempting to just walk out the school with all those like people selling different kinds of things, little snacks and stuff. Like one day I just thought... You know, it was like a bank robbery or something. (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t know. You know? Just, you know, once I was, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">steal a lot of money and get everything that I\u2019ve been craving for years and years and, you know, have it. I don\u2019t know. So... (PAUSE) Like... (PAUSE) And then my mom started telling the story. She was like, \u201cYeah, and this girl in my class was like, \u2018You know, you\u2019re daughter is buying all these things. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F2\">She has all this money.\u2019\u201c And then my mom was like, \u201cOh really?\u201d And she was dragging me like by my ear and punished me in her classroom and then we went home. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562608\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And then my dad like hit me like until I was like bleeding and peeing and stuff. And he wouldn\u2019t let me go to school the next day. He beat me some more. So I was just like... At that time, I was getting all riled up and I was getting all angry and I was telling my friend, \u201cOh, you know, like... I hate <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">my dad. I would kill him, you know, if I had the chance or whatever.\u201d (LAUGHTER) So I was just really angry, angry. And... (PAUSE) I mean, I was aware that my mom was, you know, there and listening. You know? And so like, the next morning, she wrote me an e-mail saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry this was your experience <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">and if you want to talk about it...\u201d I was like, \u201cThis is really weird. She never says this or does this.\u201d But then like I went over to talk to her and she was like, \u201cSo, I\u2019m not defending him but, you know, like he was brought up this way and his mom was very harsh with him and like, you know, she <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">burnt his hand when he tried to steal something or held it on top of a flame. So, you know, so he told me that, you know, \u2018You have to be harsh so she learns her lesson.\u2019 I would have just hid the money. That was what I was going to do. But then your dad was like, \u2018No, this is not right. We shouldn\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200314\">hide our money in our home. You know, she should be disciplined and taught a lesson,\u2019 and all that.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">And then she was like... You know, she kept going and talked about other things. And then I got really kind of frustrated with her. (LAUGHTER) I was like, you know, like, \u201cHe completely manipulated you and he gave you the victim\u2019s narrative. And everything he said was bullshit so you shouldn\u2019t even <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">be bringing him up at all. And you are defending him.\u201d (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">So I was kind of really, really mad those few days. (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) I just thought it was weird that she still kind of has this kind of trigger hang (ph) sort of thing. Like she still doesn\u2019t... (PAUSE) Well, I guess like it\u2019s okay to not completely hate him. I guess I don\u2019t either <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">completely hate him. I see the good and the bad. But I guess I feel like it\u2019s not okay for her to do that. I don\u2019t know. It did sound like she was defending him even though she said she wasn\u2019t. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">That\u2019s all. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: But did she... The fact that she offered to talk about it, about your feelings about it felt different to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like she was like someone else, like acting all mature and motherly. If that\u2019s not motherly, then at least like mature and friendly or concerned. (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) She\u2019s like, \u201cI had no idea.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, you did.\u201d (LAUGHTER) You know? \u201cI didn\u2019t stop him because I thought he <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">was (inaudible at 00:11:39).\u201d (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t think so. You know? (PAUSE) My reasoning is like... And I was telling her like, \u201cYou were under his spell. You know? He was the biggest child and he did whatever he wanted and you just let him. So... (PAUSE) I mean, you might have had your reasons. You <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B2\">know, like you might be in love with him or you actually genuinely thought that he was doing it for my own good. But, you know...\u201d (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562608\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">You know? So... (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, which was kind of really kind of... If I let it... If I was... Like, a few years ago, this behavior of hers would really kind of scare me and make me panic, you know, what she said about, \u201cOh, you know, even when we broke up, all the things he said to you, they <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D1\">were just out of anger.\u201d And I was like, \u201cHold up. (LAUGHTER) You know? Like that moment like completely changed everything for me, destroyed my life or whatever.\u201d You know? It completely made me... (PAUSE) ...hate him the way that I\u2019ve never hated anyone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">\u201cAnd you\u2019re saying, \u2018It\u2019s just anger. Let it go.\u2019\u201c I\u2019m like, \u201cNo. There\u2019s a threshold and he just always went beyond and that time he really went beyond and I was... We always say it\u2019s not okay for anyone to talk to me or treat me like that no matter who they are. Like even God cannot, you know, treat <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F1\">me like that.\u201d (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t care if he gave me birth. You know, like it\u2019s really, you know, it\u2019s not okay. I\u2019d rather him not give me birth than, you know... If you want to take it away, take it away. But you cannot treat someone like that. And I didn\u2019t like that she was kind of like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F2\">just anger.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah...\u201d Whatever it is, I don\u2019t want to know, I don\u2019t want to deal with it. Take it away. You know? So... And I thought we were like in agreement with this, like we were one with this narrative or this explanation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">But... Like sometimes when she takes a different stance on this, it kind of makes me afraid a little bit. You know? (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Afraid of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Well, that\u2019s like... I feel like that\u2019s our foundation for (SIGH) moving forward or our foundation since her breakup. The foundation being that we\u2019re united in hating him. You know? And if that\u2019s not true, then wait. What is the foundation? (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) Maybe there is a different <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">foundation. Maybe it\u2019s okay for her to be slightly less hateful towards him than me. But... Yeah. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: Well, and you\u2019re not sisters. You have such different roles vis-a-vis him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. So? (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t know. United in hating him sounds like you\u2019re equals or peers or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">CLIENT: No. But like, you know, companies and different groups are united in a certain position, parties, political parties. They all kind of take a stance on an issue or something. (LAUGHTER) It\u2019s like that. We all voted and yes and this. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">THERAPIST: But she chose him and you didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: So? (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Yeah. But you have such different roles vis a vis him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: I understand that. I understand there is a bigger picture and everything and there are nuances and all that. But I\u2019m just saying, you\u2019re supposed to say \u201cyes\u201d when I say, \u201cIt\u2019s not okay for him to treat me and you the way he treated us.\u201d You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">\u201cI want you to vote \u2018yes\u2019 on this and let\u2019s move forward.\u201d (LAUGHTER) You know, let\u2019s close the chapter. (LAUGHTER) You know, let\u2019s not be like, \u201cOh, but he was fucked up or like he, you know, he had too much whatever that day.\u201d That\u2019s bullshit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I certainly don\u2019t mean to say it\u2019s okay to make excuses for his behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20058-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20058-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562608\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I do understand that we\u2019re not sisters and... (PAUSE) ...she\u2019s my mother and she chose him. (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">THERAPIST: And I guess I say that because sometimes the way you describe it, you sort of see yourself as two children in the situation with a parent that you can\u2019t get away from. You didn\u2019t have the same power, authority. You were much more helpless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I actually don\u2019t think of myself as helpless in that scenario. I feel like I had a lot of agency. I was living away (inaudible at 00:17:25) agency that I could have that she actually couldn\u2019t. And that kind of... That distance just kind of gave me everything. It gave me power. It gave <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F1\">me like a very different perspective on the scenario that she didn\u2019t have which was why, which was the very reason I kept telling her to leave him. I wasn\u2019t financially dependent on them. I was independent. In fact, he was dependent on me. And I had like... (PAUSE) ...you know, a boyfriend who might <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005F2\">as well have been God at that point. You know, he was the voice of reason and he kept saying, you know, \u201cThis is ridiculous. This is wrong. Don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t listen to him.\u201d You know? So... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20061\">I feel like I had a lot of agency at that point that helped me get out of that situation. But... (SIGH) (PAUSE) I mean, helpless... I guess helplessness would come into the picture and maybe it does when I feel like, when I\u2019m depressed and when I think about those days and think how depressing they <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200611\">were. I have felt helpless vis a vis that scenario. It was definitely true. I guess I felt helpless when I thought there was no choice, there was no getting out. \u201cThis is my father and this is (inaudible at 00:19:01 and, you know, this is my life.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20063\">\u201cI have to love him and respect him.\u201d That\u2019s when the helpless would come in, I guess. But... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t feel helpless when I think, \u201cI don\u2019t have to love him.\u201d (LAUGHTER) Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s harsh. It sucks. But it\u2019s also actually very liberating to fall out of love. You know? (LAUGHTER) Kind of <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200631\">like falling out of love with Victor (ph). Yeah, it\u2019s... It is, you know... (PAUSE) The opposite of love is bad. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. It can be empowering. You know? (PAUSE) But yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20065\">THERAPIST: Certainly if you\u2019re loving someone because you feel compelled to. It can be very empowering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I just felt like I want my mom to experience that power. You know? I want her to feel this... Even now... I mean, even now that it\u2019s been eleven years. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">I still want her to be like, you know, \u201cYeah. I made a choice and, you know, I had choices and, you know, I made it very late but at least I made it and, you know, how great is it to be alive without him.\u201d (LAUGHTER) So... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">(PAUSE) Yeah. It took me a while to get over my anger with her (LAUGHTER) because I was like... I didn\u2019t like her defending. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">(PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: And I guess I brought up sort of the different positions because if she just totally hated him, how could she reconcile with herself why she stayed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good reason. I\u2019m just... It\u2019s complicated. I mean, you can hate your father but you stayed because what else are you going to do?

(PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20077\">(PAUSE) Yeah. And that\u2019s... I mean, I could come up with a different narrative which is more empowering. I could say that, oh instead of (inaudible at 00:23:21) she was stuck and she had no choice and just, you know, she was imprisoned and whatever. I could say, you know, her whole life she tried to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200771\">get away from him, she tried to make her and my life better despite his presence and while also still also honoring the institution of marriage or whatever. (LAUGHTER) You know, like... I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, and she kind of did leverage some, you know, like independence instead of thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200772\">completely like, oh, that horrible time when she just like came over to where I was. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20079\">We were in completely different towns and I was in college town, living near my college and she just came. It was like a two hour drive or something. But my dad drove her and just came with her bags. Like, \u201cOkay. Take care of me. I don\u2019t want to live with this guy. I want to move to this town. Find <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200791\">me a job. Find me an apartment.\u201d And we did that. You know? (LAUGHTER) So instead of... I just remember that time of... My world came crashing down. But I could think of it as, oh, you know, she was a narrative of struggle, you know, and she did the best she could. You know, I was her closest relative <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200792\">that she could trust. And she came to me to, you know, because she thought I would, was somewhat standing on my own two feet and I could help her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B\">So we figured it out and, you know... (PAUSE) And the more distance I got from him, I was able to pull her away from him even more until finally we did kind of snap off the, whatever ties. So... (PAUSE) I mean, I see... I mean, I see what you\u2019re saying that we had different roles. But I guess (PAUSE) <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2007B1\">I\u2019m still constructing a narrative in which we\u2019re united and like one common goal and one effort because I feel like maybe that brings us more power or something. You know, it empowers us. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well, and I guess I point it out because it\u2019s very... I mean, your relationship with your mom is just so confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2007F\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20081\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s unclear. Is she your mom? Is she your sister? Is she your twin? Is she your Siamese twin? Is she your daughter? It\u2019s very, very confusing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20083\">CLIENT: Yeah. It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20085\">THERAPIST: I certainly don\u2019t mean to invalidate your dad\u2019s horrific treatment and your feelings about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20087\">CLIENT: Yeah. No. I mean, I feel like we could take different roles at different times. (LAUGHTER) I mean, my whole childhood like in Nepal was like she was the mom, no question. I don\u2019t think I think of her, I thought of her as a sibling or a daughter at that point. But the roles really did reverse <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200871\">when we came here. I mean, she was still the mom the first year maybe. But then it really switched very quickly and that\u2019s kind of understandable with immigrants. So like, you know... (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20089\">THERAPIST: Well, it\u2019s loaded because, yes, that\u2019s absolutely true of immigrants and then just given the nature of your family\u2019s relationships to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008D\">THERAPIST: There\u2019s a lot going on. I mean, I certainly agree. That is very common for immigrant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. I mean, I... I mean, what do I say? Is it unhealthy for her to feel like my daughter? (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t think so. Right? Because like people\u2019s dynamics can be complicated. Like, at some point, your parents do become like your children. Right? Like when they\u2019re really old, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F1\">you do have to take care of them like you take care of a child. Right? So... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m trying to prepare myself for like that or just the fact that it is a complicated relationship and how do I respect that or live with that or make the best of it or even make it, you know, fruitful. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N2008F2\">You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562608\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20091\">THERAPIST: Well, I don\u2019t think complicated is inherently unhealthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20093\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20095\">THERAPIST: I think it can be very confusing and I do think, at times, it really brings up feelings for you. I mean, you have feelings in other areas. You\u2019re wanting people to take care of you in ways that you\u2019re not. And I do think that\u2019s a carryover from feelings (inaudible at 00:28:27) mom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20097\">CLIENT: That\u2019s true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20099\">THERAPIST: So, in some ways (inaudible at 00:28:31) but there are some byproducts of that (LAUGHTER) that you struggle with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009B\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it\u2019s definitely good or necessary to understand these byproducts. I don\u2019t understand them. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) Yeah. Can you help me? (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2009D\">THERAPIST: Well, I\u2019d like to.

How do I... (PAUSE) Like I definitely have this like... Now, I feel like it\u2019s pressing and as the months go by will feel more and more pressing. I don\u2019t know what to do about next year. (LAUGHTER) I\u2019m trying to make a plan as rationally as <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200A31\">I can. Like number one, like... All these options... Like who do I live with? What do I do about housing for next year? I\u2019m looking at (inaudible at 00:29:41) (LAUGHTER) housing. And I told you about the counter, the offers and the counter offers. Like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A5\">THERAPIST: No. You mentioned in passing something of the sort, offering. But no, I haven\u2019t heard about this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A7\">CLIENT: No. It\u2019s just like... So Chris (ph) says I can live at his place for no rent or like very little rent. He\u2019s going away for half the year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Oh, is he? For how long?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AB\">CLIENT: Just half the year. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AD\">THERAPIST: Because you were also saying that he wants to sort of make a clean break or not over the summer. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF\">CLIENT: Yeah. He\u2019s all over the place. He wants that and he wants that. And we had a nice talk just over the phone last weekend or last week and we want to do couples therapy. (LAUGHTER) So it\u2019s just like all over the place. But I told Nelson (ph) about Chris\u2019s offer and she was like, \u201cMy ex-boyfriend <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF1\">says I can live with him rent free.\u201d So he was like, \u201cHere\u2019s a counter offer. (LAUGHTER) You live here but you pay me, you know, some rent.\u201d So... (PAUSE) (LAUGHTER) But... And just not that I cannot be, you know, independent, that word we talked about earlier. You know, like... I think he said in, <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200AF2\">I don\u2019t know, reference to that or just generally this term came up that session that I\u2019m not there yet. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B1\">I guess just particularly also I feel like I\u2019m not there yet to be able to support myself and my mom because I\u2019m just able to find a job. Like I\u2019m looking. You know? (PAUSE) So... (SIGH) I\u2019m just like, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t find a job?\u201d It\u2019s not like I\u2019m having a very Zen attitude about it and sort of like <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200B11\">completely stressing out and (inaudible at 00:31:37). If I don\u2019t, then I\u2019m just like thinking I\u2019ll break up with Nelson and move back in with Chris. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) And I guess this is a byproduct maybe of my emotions for my mom.

What else? (PAUSE) Yeah. (PAUSE) And I\u2019ll be like... I\u2019ll be forced to make a choice (LAUGHTER) between the two guys. (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I am looking. I\u2019m still looking. Maybe I\u2019ll find a job. I don\u2019t know. (PAUSE) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C3\">(PAUSE) Different people need different things. I\u2019m just like... I don\u2019t really understand what it\u2019s about. You know? (PAUSE) Like another friend of mine... (SIGH) She... She\u2019s in the program with me and she moved from Alabama or somewhere. She left like another Masters or PhD program to join this, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C31\">to write. And like the first year here, she just kind of slacked off completely because she fell in love with this guy and she was like completely crazy about him and she was totally like not showing up to things and not even sometimes coming to class. She wouldn\u2019t do any of her homework and she wrote <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C32\">kind of terrible things. And I was just like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C5\">I was talking about her to another friend and like yesterday he mentioned her because he saw her boyfriend. He was like, \u201cShe gave up her writing for this guy? Really?\u201d And I was like, \u201cHuh. It\u2019s interesting you say she gave up her writing because she\u2019s turned in like a couple of really good stories <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C51\">and I\u2019m like in awe of her. And it\u2019s really strange to hear she gave up writing because she\u2019s so totally not even looking like she gave up writing. She seems like very much on top of things now. Like she turns in her homework and she writes these good things, you know, like...\u201d It doesn\u2019t mean I let <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C52\">myself get (inaudible at 00:35:45) by that. I could. I\u2019m like always pulling my hair out to get this done, get that done. She\u2019s always like (inaudible) doing it. But like so she... I guess she and the guy moved in together and I assume she\u2019s not really paying rent because, you know, he\u2019s... He makes <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C53\">much more than her. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C7\">But... Where was I going with this? (PAUSE) Yeah. I guess I was trying to understand. I\u2019m always looking at other people and what they do and trying to ask myself, \u201cShould I do this? Should I do that? Is that how it\u2019s done?\u201d So then I\u2019m like, \u201cI need to...\u201d (LAUGHTER) Like last year, when she was all <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C71\">crazy about love and everything, I was like, \u201cI want that. You know, I want to be crazy and not do any work.\u201d And now that she\u2019s stable, I\u2019m like, \u201cMaybe I want that.\u201d You know? Like maybe I need to, need... Like the equivalent of her boyfriend would be Chris, you know, like stable, steady, always there, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N200C72\">you know, makes money and lets me live with him rent free. Maybe I need that. But then when I had it, I was like, \u201cNo. I need craziness or I need to feel independent because if I feel independent, I will feel confident and I will be able to write better.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N200C6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N200C6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562608\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200C9\">So it\u2019s like... (LAUGHTER) And I understand that I could want different things at different times. But it\u2019s just like what is it? You know? (PAUSE) Am I at a phase where I need stability or like am I still in my crazy phase where it\u2019s like, \u201cNo. I need inspiration or I need to do everything myself so <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200C91\">I feel confident and then I can write better.\u201d (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Maybe I\u2019ll the sort of person... Maybe my psychology is that, at the base level, I feel helpless. So I have to do all these things to prove to myself that I can do it. Then once I have that high, then I can write. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB\">Maybe she\u2019s already up here in terms of confidence level and independence. So she just needs to kind of settle down and... You know? I don\u2019t know. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) (SIGH) She\u2019s lived like a lot more years being single and she\u2019s divorced. So... (PAUSE) I don\u2019t know. I have to compare myself. (LAUGHTER) <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CB1\">(PAUSE) I guess I do that also to give myself options and be like, \u201cThere are choices I could make.\u201d You know? And I guess it\u2019s okay to some degree to be like, \u201cWhat is that person doing? Could I do that?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. It does... I mean, you certainly use other people to compare yourself and often compare yourself downward. You often... You also look at people for models although you make a lot of assumptions in that model. You have no idea. She could be paying all the rent for all you know. You have <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N200CD1\">no idea. So you make a lot of assumptions about what that relationship is like and how he\u2019s really like Chris. And so, in a sense, it\u2019s a projection. I\u2019m not sure how much you\u2019re learning because you\u2019re projecting onto them something that you, that\u2019s familiar to you already. So it\u2019s not exactly new information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200CF\">CLIENT: What would be new information?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D1\">THERAPIST: Actually knowing what the situation is. You don\u2019t really know her boyfriend. You don\u2019t know what the situation is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D3\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Assuming when two people move in together, even when one person makes more money that that person\u2019s probably taking care of all the expenses, in this day and age, I do not think is a good assumption. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D7\">I think that\u2019s probably more rare than not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200D9\">CLIENT: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DB\">THERAPIST: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DD\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t happen.

I wouldn\u2019t assume that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E1\">CLIENT: Why not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E3\">THERAPIST: Because it\u2019s not typical. Out of a small sample size of couples but enough, that\u2019s not typical. It\u2019s not typical for one person to not be contributing to the household at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E5\">CLIENT: You mean like with money?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Certainly not in dating situations. It\u2019s not typical. It happens. I\u2019m not saying it never happens.

But I was unhappy for a lot of other reasons. I\u2019m just wondering, did that make me more attracted to him? Did he seem more attractive?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F1\">THERAPIST: Did he seem more attractive when?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F3\">CLIENT: I was paying rent. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) It\u2019s not a fair question (inaudible at 00:41:41) I just met him and all of that. So... (PAUSE)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F5\">THERAPIST: How does it feel to be part of a bidding war? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F7\">CLIENT: A bidding war? What does that mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200F9\">THERAPIST: With the housing. You were saying that there were offers and counter offers. Offers and counter offers are part of bidding wars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FB\">CLIENT: (LAUGHTER) I just feel like a prize horse. (LAUGHTER) No. I don\u2019t know. I just hadn\u2019t thought about it that way. I just feel confused and I feel like (inaudible at 00:42:31). This is not supposed to happen. It\u2019s wrong. So... (PAUSE) I guess I feel anxious. So...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Do you feel taken care of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P9-N200FF\">CLIENT: Mmm... (PAUSE) No. (LAUGHTER) I mean, I feel kind of like, \u201cOkay, there are options. Yeah.\u201d But like... No. I feel like I still need to do the work myself, you know? I mean, if I live with Chris, it still doesn\u2019t change a lot of the things that bother me. Like I might feel coddled or like... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20101\">Actually like... Do we have time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20103\">THERAPIST: We\u2019ve got a couple minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20105\">CLIENT: Yeah. I actually project myself like being there which is very different from when I\u2019m actually there. (LAUGHTER) But if I think about myself being there, I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s the table. My table was right there.\u201d (inaudible at 00:43:35) She sat in my chair and she touched my computer and the light <\/span><span data-id=\"P9-N201051\">was like that in the room at the time. You know? Like I\u2019m freaking out and it\u2019s like... I want to take my laptop out there and... I totally don\u2019t imagine, can\u2019t imagine sitting and writing in that room at all even though I wrote in that room for months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20107\">The bed is there. I don\u2019t like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20109\">THERAPIST: Are you referring to Nepal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010B\">CLENT: Chris. Chris\u2019s place. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2010F\">CLIENT: So I\u2019m just trying to imagine that even if I do take up the offer, the offer of living with him, it\u2019s not really attractive because a lot of things have come to corrupt the nice picture. I mean, it\u2019s a beautiful place because I made it beautiful. But it\u2019s not beautiful to me anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20111\">THERAPIST: Since moving out?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20113\">CLIENT: Yeah. (PAUSE) I want something new. (LAUGHTER) (PAUSE) I mean, I like this. I like the hustle of walking from my place over to various peoples\u2019 places. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20115\">So... Yeah. My hope is that I do find something so that I can be independent even if it\u2019s... I mean, I still could be on a marriage track and still have my own place. I mean, it would be like very bohemian. But why not? (LAUGHTER)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20117\">THERAPIST: A marriage track with Chris?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20119\">CLIENT: Or... Either one of them. You know? (PAUSE) (SIGH) But we do want to do couples therapy. I think it will be nice for like further closure on things. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so totally confused. It\u2019s like one day I like him. Yesterday, I liked (inaudible at 00:46:01). (LAUGHTER) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2011B\">(PAUSE) I guess I like having options but I don\u2019t want to get used to this because it\u2019s not a good scenario. It\u2019s not... (PAUSE) What do you call it? It\u2019s not viable. I just... Because having options makes me feel less trapped. It\u2019s not good. I should deal with why I feel trapped.
