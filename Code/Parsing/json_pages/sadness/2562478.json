She is a pretty recent friend, so I don\u2019t know her super well. She is moving because of conflicts with her roommate, so I feel like this could be a bad situation. I also feel like I can go be a cheerful buffer zone and I\u2019m really good at moving. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D1\">I moved every time, at least once a year, between being 14 and the first year I was in Denver. I was in the apartment with Kirsten for two years and that\u2019s the longest I\u2019ve been anywhere.  I do find that I\u2019m a little bit perfectionistic about moving. When I go to help friends move and they\u2019re not packed <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000D2\">when it\u2019s time to move, I\u2019m like come on \u2013 get it together; but I think she\u2019s packing. (pause) We talked about money and therapy this morning, so that was very hard. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">I\u2019m just sad the last couple of days, not constantly, but it will just be like grief welling up. I can sort of attach it to something, but it doesn\u2019t really seem to fit what I\u2019m attaching it to. (pause) Yesterday I was in church and I end up having a lot to do when it\u2019s church and a lot of emotionally <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">draining sort of stuff. Camilla and I had talked about going out to get a beer afterwards and then she ended up just not really having time.  Also she gave me a ride home because she lives out in Denver. She actually gave a couple of other people a ride home, too, and they actually needed to get home <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">because they had to get up in the morning. The end result was that in this way it was sort of very small and I felt like I was depleted and thought I was going to have a chance to build back up a little bit and be supportive and that didn\u2019t happen. It made me sort of really disproportionately bad. It <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F3\">was like this huge grief that I wondered where is this coming from? I don\u2019t understand this. (crying) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: I wonder if this stuff about money and moving hit some sensitive stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: I feel like the stuff about money is related, in some way, but it\u2019s hard for me to see how. That will sort of set it off, but not quite. I had a lot of thoughts about not being a nanny and there is a lot of Christianity about servant-hood and being a servant in the way that Christ was a servant. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I\u2019m like well, now I\u2019m actually a servant. (laughs) I don\u2019t think that we think of that people. I don\u2019t think we think about literal servants when we think about Christian servant-hood very much.  Maybe that\u2019s the problem. What are we going to do with that? That\u2019s sort of interesting, but I ended up <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200132\">talking some about how it\u2019s just really hard to be a poor person in a wealthy church. It\u2019s not supposed to be hard, but it\u2019s really hard. I\u2019m serving as the aggressive visitor so you\u2019ll go and drive out to see people in various hospitals and in their homes. It\u2019s always driving in somebody else\u2019s car <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200133\">because I don\u2019t drive downtown and when I tell people that I don\u2019t really like to drive downtown. Parking is obsessive and the real reason is because it costs $20 to park downtown. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well you can get a voucher stamp at the front desk that takes $8 off.\u201d So that fixes everything, right? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200134\">I\u2019m like yes, but it\u2019s still $12 to park for one Sunday service.  Yeah. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20012-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20012-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562478\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20015\">I sort of desperately needed a couple of pairs of jeans, so I went to the thrift store and I got two pairs of jeans and a shirt and a sweater for $12 the other day. That\u2019s my life. That is hard for me to talk about and think about. I posted it on Facebook so couple of people from my church read it and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200151\">sort of hijacked my Facebook page to talk about the posts, but some things were sort of different. I had given, as an example, it\u2019s hard to be looking for a job and not having any luck and then sit through a sermon on how we\u2019re all so busy that we don\u2019t have time to contemplate.  That was sort of an <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200152\">example of insensitivity and they were like \u201cAre we all so busy? What does that mean?\u201d They took up that issue, which was not at all what I care about or am interested in or was getting at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20017\">THERAPIST: I can see that whatever they went off on was not what you were saying, which is feeling marginalized in a sort of insensitive way, presuming that everybody in the congregation was oh-so-busy with everything they\u2019re doing to not have time to be contemplative, which is not your situation and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200171\">which was exclusive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20019\">CLIENT: The thing about most circumstances, I feel like conversation strings out in many directions and that\u2019s good and that\u2019s how it works. In this circumstance, I felt like they were ignoring the marginalization part and talking about . . . (both laugh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001B\">THERAPIST: They were [redoing it.] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah, so that hurt my feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F\">THERAPIST: I think it\u2019s actually a three-for even. Talking about the money, in a way, makes me think of, in a profound way, feeling unsupported or neglected. I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s not, at least as far as I know, that there is some individual who is not there who is supposed to be.  I get that, but I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2001F1\">know. You could be feeling like you have quite a lot less and have to look at the world in a sense quite differently from the people that you go to church with and probably also go some other places with, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20021\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20023\">THERAPIST: [It just doesn\u2019t stop.] (ph?) (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">CLIENT: It\u2019s hard for me to get at what thinking about money is doing for me because it\u2019s like trying to have a conversation when there is somebody\u2019s car alarm going off outside, in terms of maybe I\u2019m thinking about these other things, but mostly I just feel really super guilty all the time about the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200251\">money \u2013 always.  I just always feel like it\u2019s my fault that we\u2019re in this situation. (pause) [and I\u2019m stuck] (ph?) (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">THERAPIST: Like you\u2019ve done this to you and James.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">CLIENT: Yeah, but I\u2019ve always been that way about money. Whenever I feel financially insecure I feel like I have only myself to blame for that. I\u2019ve always been that way. (sighs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not surprised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">CLIENT: Nope. (laughs) You\u2019ve seen me there. (sniffling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">THERAPIST: I don\u2019t mean for that to say that it\u2019s terrible, I just . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">CLIENT: No, I know. (long pause)  I don\u2019t know if I [should say anything to the women] (ph?) who sort of hacked my Facebook page. I don\u2019t know. In some ways, it\u2019s this very small and subtle thing. In other ways, the types of conversations that they were having and the types of conversations that I tend <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">to have with them are focused on these small and subtle dynamics. It\u2019s always sort of a trade-off for me. When is it worth it to stand up for myself, even if it doesn\u2019t do anything? (voice breaking) I feel like it\u2019s almost always never. (laughs) (sniffling)  (long pause) These scarves, it\u2019s like [pashmina] <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200312\">(ph?). It says 100% pashmina. That\u2019s not a real fiber. (laughs) You just made that up. (long pause)  Jame\u2019s mom sent him a couple of shirts for his birthday, sort of a blue-and-white check and sort of a dark blue. He tried it on today and he was like, \u201cI think it\u2019s too loud.\u201d (laughs) We are doing okay. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200313\">(long pause)  I\u2019ve been eating a lot of cake for breakfast, birthday cake, Bundt cake, which is a lot of cake when it comes down to it. (laughs) I always forget that a Bundt cake is the equivalent of two loaf cakes. For two people . . .<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20030-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20030-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562478\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20033\">THERAPIST: Yeah, that\u2019s a lot. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20035\">CLIENT: James finished the paper that he\u2019s been working on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20037\">THERAPIST: That\u2019s great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20039\">CLIENT: Yeah. We talked again about where we were in terms of where he was going to apply. He\u2019s back around to thinking he\u2019s going to apply for post docs again. There really aren\u2019t any other jobs that he\u2019s interested in and this, at least, opens the door to jobs that he is interested in. But then that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200391\">makes the Denver area a better area to apply than Texas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003B\">THERAPIST: For post docs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Is there more of them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">CLIENT: There are better schools here.  There aren\u2019t very many schools with people that he would want to work with. I should say that there are better chemistry programs. That\u2019s more accurate. I am, at this point, so ambivalent, in terms of feeling very strongly that we should stay in Denver and I also <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200411\">feel very strongly that we should move to Texas. (laughs) I\u2019m sort of like well, why don\u2019t you just apply for things and we\u2019ll see? I think he\u2019s going to do the first round of applications in Denver.  (pause) I think he listed really liking Dr. Smith as a reason to stay here, which I found very heartening. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200412\">It sort of makes me feel better. (laughs) (sniffles)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">THERAPIST: Good. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">CLIENT: Jessica is having a baby any second. She went to the hospital a couple of days ago and spent the night because she was having contractions. They sent her home again because she stopped. (long pause)  I started writing a letter to [Dan] (ph?) in my journal last night, which I haven\u2019t done for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">like a year. I find that I think of him when it feels like somebody has disappeared on me. (crying) I don\u2019t know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:13)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I was reading this book and was talking to Candace about it. Some of the stuff I\u2019m reading, I\u2019m angry about but I really don\u2019t want to be there, and am like why not? Why is that wrong?  (pause) [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:11), like I don\u2019t want to shut people out with my writing. I <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200491\">feel like when I read people who are angry, not in general, but angry in a particular way or with a particular tone, I end up feeling sort of accused and then beleaguered and then why are you blaming me for this in your life? Maybe it\u2019s actually my fault, but I don\u2019t really want to help you fix it now. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200492\">I don\u2019t want to do that, but I don\u2019t know.  (pause) I\u2019m just ready to stop grieving. I\u2019m ready to stop being angry and sad and bitter. Clearly not, because I\u2019m not stopping. (crying) I know that my dad filled out a job application of sorts and he was writing stuff about his ministry and his job and <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200493\">how he has done it. There was something that was like have you handled conflict within the church? Within your parishes?  He left the church that I grew up in under really tough circumstances and I don\u2019t really know the whole story, but basically there were personal conflicts that sort of spiraled out <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200494\">of control and he had to leave and it was awful. Maybe it was his fault and maybe it wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t really know, but that sort of thing happens all the time in churches. He spent a whole half page and talked. There was one sentence about what had happened at Cavalry, in terms of how he had handled <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200495\">conflicts. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it, clearly. I was like you need to talk about it, even if what you say is that this was awful and it never really got resolved. You need to tell us what happened because it looks like you\u2019re trying to avoid it. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562478\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004B\">THERAPIST: I follow.

I guess it was just that I\u2019m really not over that, even though it was like 15 years ago \u2013 maybe 12 years ago. (pause)  It\u2019s really hard for me to remember why I\u2019m not in bible anymore, why I\u2019m not doing that. I don\u2019t remember the train of events. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2004D1\">I don\u2019t remember very much about it. It\u2019s just gone. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Maybe that\u2019s the thing that you\u2019re most clearly grieving about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. But I don\u2019t even know what actually fits. (crying) It\u2019s sort of what I put there.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20053\">THERAPIST: I guess I was thinking about I think you generally don\u2019t, like that quality of [ ] (inaudible at 00:29:05) being angry. You\u2019re never that confident putting that on anybody else that you feel . . . I guess there are two different things. One is to hold somebody else responsible for treating <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200531\">you that way; the other is the uncertainty that they have. It\u2019s one thing to say grad school and bible at Brown is a placeholder for something else and another to say you feel justified being angry and holding the department or whomever responsible.  [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:15) (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20055\">CLIENT: I feel like [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:29).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20057\">THERAPIST: Really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I\u2019m not sure I can explain why but . . . (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B\">THERAPIST: Well maybe part of it is that at the moment, I think there is a lot that you don\u2019t really know either, so it puts us in the same boat. My impression is you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re feeling aggrieved and bitter over and it\u2019s pretty confusing and unsettling. You don\u2019t want to be feeling <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005B1\">this way in the first place, but especially if you don\u2019t know what the hell is going on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:37) It sort of feels like these emotions are small children running back and forth through the house, stomping all over the place and I don\u2019t know where this is coming from. It\u2019s not attached to anything. What\u2019s going on.  (long pause)  It feels like I\u2019ve got all <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2005D1\">this grief and bitterness and that it\u2019s all going to wash out on other people and spill outside of me.
