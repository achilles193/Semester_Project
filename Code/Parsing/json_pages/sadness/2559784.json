That's fine, I'm happy to do that, which is a couple of weeks away.

Okay. All right. So it's easy for me to (pause) look and see that they did that. They probably sent it since the beginning of this month, because otherwise I suspect I would have caught it. I mean, usually when I go through to make statements...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Yeah, it would have been...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Then I would have seen the money came in. [0:02:07] I guess I just wanted to make sure that... I mean, you guys will be calling it sounds like anyway. But I want to make sure something like that couldn't happen and not get caught. But I think I would have caught it. It must have come in last <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200371\">week. But I'll double check on it. In any case...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: And James would catch it if you didn't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay, so, all right. So I'll just credit you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Okay, thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: So I dropped my phone in a puddle on the way over here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">THERAPIST: Oh no.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: No, it's (pause) ones that come free with a plan. And I think it's... two years are almost up. We'll probably [just replace it] (ph). So... it was just one of those comic, you see it fall, and you see it coming, and you don't do anything about it. [0:02:56] (Pause) So Sharon (sp?), the youngest <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">one, for... in the last couple of days has had a hard time sleeping for reasons that are still not entirely clear to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">THERAPIST: Is she nine months or so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: Yeah, she's nine months. I think she's, like, a combination of teething. And her mom leaves breast milk, but we usually run out over the course of the day. And so she's used to taking... going to... having a nap with a feeding. And so it's like, who is this strange person trying to give me formula? <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200491\">Anyway, it's not so clear. But anyway, she screamed for over an hour on Wednesday. And that's not very much fun. [0:03:55] And I knew that that was what happens with babies. And... but still it just really sucked and was very stressful. And then I... it was over eventually. And a couple of hours later <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200492\">I was thinking about it, and I was like, wow. That was so much easier than being depressed (chuckling). I just dealt with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559784\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">CLIENT: It wasn't fun, but (pause) it was just so much easier, which was a good... (Pause) Which I took as a kind of sign or reminder that the things that make me want to kill myself are mostly coming from me, not from outside myself? [0:05:03] And, when I put it that way, it sounds a little horrible. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">But, on the other hand, it's... I don't know, it's just kind of reassuring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">CLIENT: Yeah. I can deal with this. (Pause) And I think...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">THERAPIST: I see. You tend to worry more about what life has or might throw at you, but in a way...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">CLIENT: It's really not the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">THERAPIST: [That's not the hard part] (ph).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:05:56] I have to... (Pause) I still feel like I need to manage all the things that life does throw at me so that I don't get overwhelmed by them or so that they don't hit the parts of my brain that are trying to kill me...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">CLIENT: Or hit them too hard. (Pause) Yeah, nannying continues to be a combination of really good and really hard. This week it's kind of my own fault because I ended up staying late on Wednesday, because they were going out to dinner. [0:07:04] And so I said, sure, I can stay until you get back, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200611\">which meant that I was there from 8:00 in the morning until 10:30 at night on Wednesday, and then 8:00 in the morning again. And then I ended up staying a couple of hours late yesterday also, because they... Monica's (sp?) sister had her first baby yesterday, and so they were... so they drove to St. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200612\">Louis last night actually. And so I stayed to help them get in the car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">THERAPIST: I see, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">CLIENT: But so that was just... that I just can't do that again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">CLIENT: That's not good for me (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yeah. I just didn't have any patience yesterday, and I hate that in myself. [0:07:57] Yeah. It's just... I was just tired when I got there, and [that wasn't any good] (ph). (Pause) James's parents are coming to visit tomorrow for a couple days. We'll see how that is. I think it'll be good. They're <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D1\">pretty... (Pause) I feel comfortable with them. I care about them a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">CLIENT: And I also don't feel like I need to take care of them all the time. (Pause) My mom gave me a tea set for my birthday, which was... actually I collect teapots, so (laughing) I haven't really been collecting them in the last couple of years because we live in a studio. [0:09:02] And so they're <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">not... they don't take up that much room, but they take up space. But it was just really a very sweet and thoughtful thing. And I think I told her about the teapots six months ago, and she filed it away. (inaudible at 0:09:19). It was really nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20075\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, I feel like I'm doing well except for when I worry that I'm really not doing well. [0:09:58] (Chuckling) So I need to get my hair cut. The last time I got a haircut was more than six months ago. I think it was in October. I really need a haircut. And I woke up today and was <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200751\">like, okay, I'm going to get my hair cut. This is what I'm going to do today. And I just couldn't face the idea of having to talk to the stylist. I feel like haircuts are designed to be ordeals for shy people (chuckling), because you can't... you have to make conversation. I don't like making conversation <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200752\">with anybody. I don't... it's so hard. [0:10:56]<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20074-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20074-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559784\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Sometimes it's less agonizing than others, but... so I didn't get my haircut (chuckling). I decided I could skip that. (Pause) We end up... I end up spending a fair amount of time with Frank, who's the husband in the family...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: Or being in the same house, he...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Yeah, he works at home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: Yeah, he works from home sometimes. And his hours are odd. Anyway, I spend way more time with him than I was anticipating. [0:11:58] And I think he's a little shy, or... I don't know why, but it's really awkward (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">THERAPIST: Oh, really?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah. I'm working on it, but it's just really awkward (chuckling). (Pause) Partly because the kids... they like me, but they like their dad a lot more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">CLIENT: But he's trying to work from home, and so I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: No, it's much tougher in a situation like that than when the parents are out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: Yeah. [0:12:57]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">THERAPIST: A lot of times I think shy people really don't want to be around when the parents are at home. I mean, not... they [don't mind seeing them] (ph) for five minutes when they do handoff...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: But it's a different thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: Yeah. And it's also a little awkward because part of me also really just wants to hang out with Monica and Frank? They're really great, I would like to be friends with them? But they're my employers, and I'm really awkward also (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: So... actually I think it's getting better. I think it's just...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Well, I think part of what's hard for you is (pause) not exactly acknowledging how hard it is or how uncomfortable or how awkward but how much you feel responsible and at fault, I think, for that. [0:14:05] I don't mean as opposed to him. I mean, like, you should be able to handle it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: And, if you can't (pause), that feels bad for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think it wasn't until I was... I feel like it wasn't until I was most of the way through college that I started to realize that other people also found making conversation with people that they didn't know very well excruciating and difficult and had it not go well, and that maybe that <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">didn't actually mean that I was just bad at being a person. [0:15:10]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: So yeah. I have to... I've had to explicitly remind myself a lot that maybe Frank is also shy and awkward and that is why conversations aren't easy. It's not just me, and also that in the long run that's not really that big of a deal. Not finding it easy to talk to people you don't know is not... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A51\">it's just not that big of a deal. [0:15:55] (Pause) I say that, but it feels like a big deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah.

What's wrong here? What am I doing? (Pause) [0:17:01] And I was good at talking with people (inaudible at 0:17:13). But that's a very circumscribed situation.

(Pause) Something about (inaudible at 0:18:45). I don't know. I don't think it's that it's sort of reality rather than kind of saying it's in your head about how you are. [0:19:01] In fact, it's because [you feel like] (ph) the baby's shrieking at you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: It's just screaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, I know it's not anything I'm doing...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Or... it's like, well, maybe I could find the one magical thing that she needs at this moment...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: Or wants at this moment and could give it to her. But I don't feel like I'm particularly at fault if I can't. (Pause) [0:20:00] I went to the yarn store today, and it was kind of the situation of, like, I was really awkward in there, trying to talk to those people. And there, I love... it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">a space that I love. It's my favorite store in Cambridge, and it's wonderful. But it's awkward, also because I can't afford to buy anything? And so that's awkward. And... (Pause) Or very much. (Pause) [0:21:00] Yeah, I feel like I've gotten to the point where I... it seems easier to become okay with <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C12\">not being polished socially than it is to actually become polished socially (chuckling).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: [I'm still sort of getting there] (ph) (pause), or feel like I'm polished socially.

[0:21:55] And in the car I was kind of talking with Jackson (sp?) about the day. And Jackson's the five-year-old. And Frank's like, well, how were they today? And I was like, oh, yeah, they were pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C91\">good. It was fine. I was... everyone was a little tired. I was really cranky, but they were fine for the most part. And Jackson was like, you weren't... you didn't seem cranky. I was like, I'm very good at hiding my feelings (laughing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: And she said, oh, okay. But that was very surprising to me, because I felt like I was just not in a good mood all day in a way that I expected them to pick up on. (Pause) [That was good] (ph). (Pause) [0:23:00] I think I'm going to have to let go of wanting to do everything right all the time <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD1\">in taking care of kids. But I'm not really sure how to do that. (Pause) [0:24:01] Mostly I'm just glad it's the weekend. (Pause) I feel like I have fewer memories. [0:24:58] Or I find fewer new things that I don't remember. I was cleaning up today and found a small painting that had somehow landed on <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD2\">a table somewhere. I've seen it every day or every other day for the last few months. I just looked, and I finally said, okay, James, where did this come from, because I don't know where it came from. And he said, I think you did it, made it when you were in the hospital. I was like, I'm pretty sure <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD3\">I did not make this. I would have remembered that, maybe. But so now I'm like... it's really ugly (laughing). I don't want it. [0:25:58] If I had made it, I would feel okay because then I could just throw it away and that would be fine. But then what if it has some great sentimental value?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CC-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559784\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">THERAPIST: (Chuckling)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">CLIENT: (Laughing) Does something have sentimental value if you can't remember the sentiment or the person?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">CLIENT: But I didn't throw it away.

(Pause) [0:28:00] Yeah, I mean, thinking of social events, it feels like I'm at one of those parties where you know a few people. And you know more people by sight, and there are a lot of people whose names <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD1\">you can't remember. And you have to kind of get through the evening without fucking anything up.

[0:29:03] But I'm thinking of... (Pause) You're worried that you'll get into something that's really painful or really upsetting here, and that <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF1\">that's the kind of way that you could get fucked up, and that the people are... the ones you're more familiar with are sort of the things that feel kind of a little more secure, less worrisome, sort of healthier as you go about the day. [0:29:57] And the ones that you feel like are at more of a distance <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF2\">or are harder to name are the things that are more upsetting, more disturbing, more depressive. And you're worried about getting confronted with one of them, you know what I mean? Or having a kind of very painful exchange whenever you kind of get hit with something like that, which sometimes happens <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF3\">here. I think it seems like you're worrying... I have the impression that you're worrying about that...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">THERAPIST: And at the same time (pause) probably also want to be in contact with some of that, too, I think.

(Pause) Well, you know, the things that I really want to talk about are the things that are difficult but not too painful...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">THERAPIST: Uh-huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">CLIENT: And... (Pause) I mean, this is sort of a... this feels sort of strange to say, but the things that I know I'll survive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (Pause) [0:32:00]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: Yeah. You say that, and I think of... I of course immediately think about James and the extent to which I've been just avoiding talking about the things that are hard with him recently, even though I really need to and want to also. (Pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: You mean the kind of things that you're feeling are really hard, or the things between the two of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F1\">CLIENT: The things between the two of us.

I mean, I understand what you said, that... and I think that (inaudible at 0:34:56) it's probably true, that you said you want to talk about things that are difficult but not too painful. [0:35:02] I believe that.

(Pause) [0:36:00] A fair amount of that fear has to do with actually the process of talking about those things in this case with me, in other words not just the content of what you'd be talking about, but the potential for getting even more hurt or upset at any moment, my <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201071\">saying something that is even more hurtful or more upsetting and unexpected...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">THERAPIST: Or you're... that you sort of feel guilty about for saying to me or putting out there on me in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">CLIENT: I feel like that's more difficult for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">THERAPIST: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) [0:37:00] But maybe I just can't seem to (pause), I don't know, volunteer for that.

(Pause) [0:39:01] Even though the... (Pause) Even though the effects of the sort of... even though the ultimate effect is a relief. It's a relief to talk about these things here. And in the same way self-injury was a <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201191\">relief. [0:40:02] Even so, it doesn't make it easier. (Pause) Here's what's going on, I don't know what to make of it...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">CLIENT: Where...
