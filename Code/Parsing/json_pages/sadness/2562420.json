[Pause] This [pause] I\u2019ve been kind of [pause] I guess I\u2019ve been feeling a little bit lazy or kind of not really wanting to think about things that I need to do or kind of plan. I feel like, I guess I don\u2019t I could have planned out my week and thought more about some of my experience in <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">my [inaudible at 00:03:18] work and help set up. But, I don\u2019t know, for some reason I really didn\u2019t want to think about it or deal with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">And I\u2019m not really sure why. I don\u2019t know, I guess I worked with the feels like something bad for the count or something like, kind of an impending doom or something but I don\u2019t understand why. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">I feel like I\u2019ve been, especially on Thursday and Friday of last week putting together an annual report for one of the projects and taking a bunch of figures and getting numbers, I don\u2019t know something about it made me kind of think something bad is going to happen or I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">if it\u2019s because I had to put off other things to kind of, other things I wanted to do to kind of focus on getting these numbers or whatever but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just feeling overwhelmed or not wanting to deal with things or having trouble remembering things but [pause] I\u2019m not sure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: I wonder if it\u2019s only in the office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Maybe a little bit. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really not looking forward to this, training someone or I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re going to organize things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Yes having to train somebody\u2019s like I remember when you had those, it was one quite anxious Post-doc and then there were maybe two people not too long ago where you had to post her peers for a couple of days and teach stuff to. I imagine training somebody would be a few months of that, which <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\">you did not like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s just I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll, or this thing will come across or I\u2019ll be, I\u2019ll still be busy but then having to train this person, then, I don\u2019t know, not wanting to trust them or something, I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">But I guess I don\u2019t, I guess I could plan it all out and write everything out or something like that but I don\u2019t know. I guess after a long night I don\u2019t really have much energy or time or I don\u2019t really want to focus on that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being really stubborn but it just kind of makes me not want to deal with it. I\u2019m not less excited about change but <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: When you say not wanting to deal with this meaning the sort of way that you\u2019re feeling, being kind of low energy and having trouble being sort of motivated to want to come into work or do you mean with leaving or with training somebody? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: I guess with all of it, mostly with, yes aspects of leaving or I don\u2019t know. And [pause] but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being lazy or kind of stubborn. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: If you don\u2019t feel ready to kind of tackle it head on, it means you\u2019re being lazy or stubborn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right. Also just, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to be excited about it and just kind of worried about feeling responsible for this person and responsible for setting up a new life that would be good or positive. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562420\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: You mean for yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: Yes, and you said that you kind of wouldn\u2019t want to be excited about that but in fact you\u2019re really dreading it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: I think my own fight is just kind of right now I feel overwhelmed and, I don\u2019t know, I feel like there\u2019s a lot of backlog of things at work I get to do. Even though and it\u2019s always like extremely, mainly when I was new here I was put on hold but then all these little things come up and I don\u2019t <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200371\">know. Trying to get everything done until I have to go back to the other experiment, it\u2019s just overwhelming and [pause] and I guess I just want less things I guess because I kind of decide what to deal with or <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">THERAPIST: Well, I think that there are some ways in which the office has been kind of at the center of your life when you moved here. And probably it\u2019s hard to leave even if there\u2019s a lot that you don\u2019t like about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">CLIENT: Right. And it\u2019s just it\u2019s familiar. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my tendency to in terms of blaming or making decisions or just wanting everything done right away or kind of, I don\u2019t know. I guess I need to kind of be okay with things taking longer or kind of adjusting to it, I don\u2019t know. I guess <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">for example going in on Monday I always feel extremely overwhelmed and want to do everything immediately and it\u2019s hard for me to [take it off] (ph) or I don\u2019t want to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: Well I think also sometimes for you I think emotional stuff gets sort of played out through doing things. In other words I think you are anticipating and experiencing your dread of the change and leaving the office in terms of the things you have to do as part of that. And clearly they are <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F1\">a part of that, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not, and I can see why you dread having to train somebody I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">But it does seem like some of the things you\u2019re worried about or are not looking forward to or have mixed feelings about, about leaving, kind of I think has sort of folded into the things on your to-do list, that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Right, and [pause] right. [Pause] I don\u2019t know. I guess I feel like I\u2019m just kind of complaining about it or I don\u2019t know [inaudible at 00:22:31]. I think it\u2019s just me, I don\u2019t like anticipating or just I want it to be over, I want it to be done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s hard to have it just kind of floating out there in the future?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know, always (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I see. There\u2019s really, if I think about it, there\u2019s really quite a lot that you can\u2019t control when it comes to the move. I mean in terms of exactly how you finish things up in the office and who the new person is and training them and all sorts of things to do with moving, things to do with <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D1\">leaving this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">I mean a lot of that is stuff that you can\u2019t figure out yet or you can\u2019t know about yet, which is real dreadful I think. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really know how to handle it because it kind of comes in surges of me being busy but then I, the surge of being worried about it or kind of like I need to be doing something about it or then I\u2019ll tell myself I\u2019ll do a bit later but then, I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s not comforting <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200531\">or does kind of leads me to worry about it [like I am now] (ph). <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20052-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20052-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562420\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">THERAPIST: I really know a good way to manage the worry about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: I mean I could tell myself I\u2019ll figure it out but I don\u2019t know it just makes me feel like I need to start organize or doing things or start organizing things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: And this is also since it\u2019s something I can\u2019t actually help you with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: Right. I don\u2019t know. [Pause] Right, yes it just feels like I\u2019m just worrying about it for no reason or I\u2019m being negative. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: I see. I get a sense of if I can\u2019t help you then really there\u2019s no point of talking about it. And that means you\u2019re just talking about it because you\u2019re being negative or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Right. [Pause] I was just thinking why I don\u2019t like teaching or kind of, I don\u2019t know, and what is it that I\u2019m missing or kind of I\u2019ve got some kind of fault or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Or some kind of fault?
