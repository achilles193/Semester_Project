Maybe I did, but I\u2019m not ready to accept it, that I just was not looking for anything serious or that I still have Chris (ph) in my mind and I was just\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to be objective about this stuff. [laughs] <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">Like you said, I was unhappy with Chris and I know I was, so\u2026 [sighs] I guess the gray area was whether we thought or I thought we could work issues out.

[laughs] I think that\u2019s what I was starting to talk about on Monday in the ending.  He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, from age 25 to 35, I\u2019ve been seeing women with the intent of getting married, and that didn\u2019t work. Now I\u2019m changing my approach and putting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">no pressure on myself in trying to have a relationship. I\u2019m just seeing where it goes.\u201d [laughs] It was worrisome to tell someone like me, who\u2019s already [laughs] always worried that (inaudible at 00:11:44).

[laughs] Then he came out and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B5\">Since then, we\u2019ve been kind of exploring this, but he can\u2019t really\u2014I think I told you what exactly, because he can\u2019t really get it up for, I don\u2019t know.  He has problems with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Is he able to get an erection at all?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B9\">CLIENT: Yeah, but it kind of goes away really quickly and he loses focus and all that. In a way, I\u2019m fine with that, in the sense that it makes feel like (inaudible at 00:29:23) [laughs] I guess I\u2019m thinking. It makes me rethink Chris, I guess. [laughs] Reconsider him, almost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BB\">It complicates my understanding of sexuality. It\u2019s a very recent acquisition anyways, my understand of sexuality, my experience. I\u2019m learning that, okay, Chris. I\u2019m not attracted, but his performance is fine.  He\u2019s attentive, he\u2019s not selfish, it\u2019s not all about him. He can get an erection.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200BA-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200BA-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561608\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">With Nelson, I\u2019m attracted.

Is this one of the areas in which I\u2019m lost, sexuality?

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u201clost,\u201d per se. I understand that people have\u2014I\u2019ve talked to other friends about this. [laughs] They\u2019re really taking me to task for this thing. This was something that this guy said, he\u2019s like, \u201cSo you\u2019re attracted to someone who\u2019s not good in bed, and you\u2019re not <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E31\">attracted to someone who is,\u201d or something. \u201cYou want someone,\u201d I don\u2019t know how he phrased it; the words were brilliant at that time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E5\">I understand that there are these experiences other people and normal people have, but for some reason, I\u2019m not really any more desperate to have those same experiences. [sighs] I feel like I\u2019m having so much fun just being with someone that I\u2019m finally physically attracted to that I don\u2019t want to put <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E51\">pressure or make demands on this beautiful, ideal sexual experience that I think is out there, that I think everyone else is having except me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E7\">I do feel at peace about that. I know that I\u2019m not quite at peace about [laughs] the fact that I like two guys for two very different things.  Maybe they\u2019re same things. [laughs] Well, same thing like Chris can\u2026my sexual experience with Chris is satisfactory in this one very specific regard. My sexual <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200E71\">experience with Nelson is kind of more colored.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200E9\">This is weird, though, because at first, he didn\u2019t want to do it. I guess he wasn\u2019t sure about me, but then also he wasn\u2019t sure about his own abilities. Since then, he\u2019s very into this and he wants to do it three, four times a day. By \u201cdo it,\u201d I mean not intercourse but just whatever way that he does it.

I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s accurate [laughs] in a sense. Am I really doing it? Because come Friday and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m tired of being by myself,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m bored and I really need that release, that reward.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20121\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20123\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to use this as a way to make myself more secure in other areas. I don\u2019t need his whatever, commitment, his word, his loyalty. I say this, but then I definitely have breakdown when I find out\u2014couple weeks ago, I think, I accidentally saw an e-mail between him and this <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201231\">girl. [laughs] [0:39:05] I had a (inaudible at 00:39:09) moment of panic. Kind of freaked out and got really drunk and had the worst hangover of my life. It\u2019s just like I\u2019m hurting myself. [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20125\">That was a first, with him \u2013 first as in drinking too much and having a hangover, throwing up and all. I find out he\u2019s dating other women, maybe I won\u2019t get drunk. [laughs] Maybe I\u2019ll just take it up with him and end it or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20127\">Yeah, this is like\u2014I feel like we\u2019re kind of in this weird game, we\u2019re playing this weird game where it\u2019s like I need him for all the excitement and stuff, because I don\u2019t have any other reliable source [laughs] for that.  He needs me for sex, because he doesn\u2019t have any other reliable source for that. <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201271\">[laughs] That\u2019s a pretty depressing way of looking at it, like an exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20126-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20126-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2561608\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">It\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t care about each other, but when this happens, when we find this out, then it\u2019s hard\u2014that\u2019s what you say about the situation. Not that, \u201cWe care about each other.\u201d [laughs]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">(pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah, just not having that security just makes me try and look for it in other places, I guess.

I feel like it\u2019s normal or it\u2019s right. Like what you said, if you\u2019re not getting security and you need it, you should be careful. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s actually good that I\u2019m not getting it [laughs] because I\u2019m looking for it not with him but inside myself. [laughs] It\u2019s weird because that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201351\">like the equivalent of saying, \u201cYeah, every morning I\u2019m getting up to the 20th floor and just threatening to jump just to feel\u2026\u201d Is that the right analogy? Just like dangling from the 20th floor just to find inner strength. [laughs]  People do that, to find inner strength, don\u2019t they? They jump off planes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">THERAPIST: How are you jumping off a plane?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">CLIENT: [sighs] By letting go of the plane called Chris.

Does it feel that way?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">CLIENT: I think so. Anything not Chris and not Nelson is my own parachute, right?  Even if it\u2019s friends and stuff, right? Yeah, helping my friend with his Ph. D. application, still. Literature, my mom, that\u2019s part of my parachute.
