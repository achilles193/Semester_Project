Which is a good thing. I feel like I'm in an okay place. I haven't necessarily been in the last several days, but I am now. (pause) I was struggling with what is important to say and what is going to be helpful. And, you know, if I knew exactly all of it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200131\">I wouldn't be here in some sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: But there's also no way to like It's essentially like trying to draw a map for you without knowing what the important features are. I can't reproduce the entire experience because you would have had to be there to do that. And I can't necessarily tell what the important features are always. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200171\">Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Well you started to draw that map because you said, \"Today is okay but the last several days haven't been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: So that seems important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: (laughs) Fair enough. I just try to tell you why I can say that and then it takes me a while to formulate what the next thing is. I think that the most important place to go is, over the weekend I sort of continue to feel angry and sad and hurt but I also felt kind of alone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">Which we've talked about loneliness before. You suggested that therapy was one way to help deal with that, and that has been helpful. But (pause) But, I don't know, I ended up feeling sort of disconnected from friends and family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">And also like I had this great pain that I couldn't talk about with them because I don't want to hurt them. And at some point I just sort of decided that I need to talk about it. I can talk about it with you and that's good and helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">So I guess Friday, or something like that, I called my mother just to talk. I told her some of what I was feeling but in a like outline sort of way. And she just did not seem, you know maybe it was a bad day talk, but she didn't seem like she could handle hearing about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">I think there's a sense in which she hurts for me already knowing what I've been going through. And so hearing the details sometimes are hard. And I think it's harder, like I think it was harder on that day than in a general sense. I think she was just tired from whatever had been going on in the normal <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200271\">day to day. But sort of like my mother is one of the first people I would talk to about emotional issues in some ways. And so feeling like I couldn't do that was isolating. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">So I sent a lot of e-mails to friends that I had been, that I've been in correspondence with by e-mail a lot but it's been a while since we've been in touch. Just as a like, just following the thread of whatever conversation we've been having.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Tanya and I had our weekly games night with our friend Franco and that was good. Or it started out well. I like playing games. I actually don't mind losing games usually, but found myself rather upset at the end of the evening. And knowing that in a general sense I don't really care about losing the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">games. I like to win, I really like to win but it's not an issue that really comes outside of the bounds of the game in some ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">I feel like there was some essential feature of what was going on in the games that like played into what is going on in my life. And sort of, the games we're playing one of the strategies is to bog your opponent down by just filling their deck of cards with worthless cards. And this is a strategy that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">Franco is good at and the cards lend themselves to. But it's not one that I'm willing to play because I don't like what it does to the person.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">And so the counterstrategy is just to like run out the cards that are crappy by dispersing them as quickly as possible. But I don't like that because I don't like the strategy. And somehow sort of end up playing these games bogged down by this sort of disproportionate thing that seems like in some ways <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200311\">analogies to the rest of my life are not too hard to draw. (voice sounds a bit strained) Does that sound right? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">THERAPIST: What are the particular analogies you're drawing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">CLIENT: (pause) So there's the one of just feeling bogged down in what I'm doing. Like, you know, I think I mentioned that someone swiped the mirror of our car while it was parked on the street. And just, you know, daily life things to deal with that happen to come amongst all of these other larger <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">things that are hard to deal with. Just I feel bogged down in trying to handle that sort of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">So there's that particular sense. And then there's the sense of like (pause) playing by a set of rules that I have artificially imposed that in some way make the experience worse for me. (pause)  And then I think there's a sense in which like (pause) I find the analogy harder to draw and it's not <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">the one that occurs first, but it's probably relevant. There's this sense in which like Tanya has been making my life very hard for a long time and I'm not really willing to make hers hard in response. I don't feel like that's a reasonable response or something. So those are the ones that come to mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Mm. I was thinking about the sort of the wasteful useless cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: There's something sort of useless and wasteful with no particular point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean there's no point for me. For Franco the point is that it lets him win because then it dilutes the useful cards. But, yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Well I think, I mean there's a feeling of like sort of what Tanya's doing is wasteful and useless. And what is the point of this? In a sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah. Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: What is the goal? You know, what is the goal in all this? What is the point?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (voice sounds strained) And I think in the last several weeks I've settled on a narrative of what's happened as like, she really needed to leave Brown and some of the life circumstances surrounding it, but couldn't do it. Just could not identify her own needs or was unwilling to <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">do it, or something in that line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">And so that's the (pause) Put another way, given a set of fairly obvious problems, could not deal with them until they were life threatening. And in a sense couldn't deal with them then. Other people had to. (pause) Yeah. That's interesting. I hadn't really thought of that analogy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">THERAPIST: Mm. Do you feel like you were particularly upset or unhappy this last several days versus other times? Or just you noting it in comparison to today when you feel better?<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: I mean definitely noting it in comparison to today. (pause) I think over the last several weeks I'll go through a few days where I feel reasonably okay. And then a few days where I'm hurt or angry or something in that spectrum. And so it wasn't particularly unusual in that scale. I feel like <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">part of it is as Tanya gets better that this question of futility or something like it becomes bigger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Just, I mean both the immediacy of the crisis is gone, and so there's like we don't have to be in the crisis mode where I just handle the things. Which I'm actually really good at doing for the most part. I mean you've seen me. (laughs) I'm also not really good in some ways. But I come here <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200551\">and deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">And, at any rate, as the crisis mode is gone it's sort of like I have the feelings of the experience to deal with. And also as she gets better, there's just this question of, if you can be okay now, where were you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">CLIENT: Why couldn't you be okay through the same path but skip the part where you almost kill yourself? And there's a part of me that knows that's not fair because there's a real sense in which the hospitalizations and potentially the ECT, although it's less clear, are all a part of time passing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">And her doing therapy and her working to come to grips with what she needs to come to grips with, whatever exactly that is. But there's still that question. (pause) Why can it be okay now? And why couldn't it be okay before? Which I think is in a lot of ways what you were talking about is uselessness or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">CLIENT: At least the way I see it, that it's like (pause) we've done all this stuff, but it's not really clear that anything I did mattered other than she's still alive so that she could do this thing now. But essentially she's just gotten better. (sigh) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) And so that in some way, at least before (ph), is there a feeling that she's failed you, failed herself and failed you? (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) And I think it's failed me in a way that I can't really understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">CLIENT: You know, you made a comparison a couple of weeks ago to infidelity and loss of trust there. I still think it was a good and interesting analogy. But I could actually deal with the infidelity more easily. It's not like that's entirely gone, it doesn't hurt at all, but like it was never as bad <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200691\">in some ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Like it never hurt as much. And I think part of that is I could always understand how it happened. It just it made sense in a way that this doesn't make sense. (pause) You know I understand what infatuation or falling in love is like. I don't understand what wanting to kill yourself is like. <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D1\">It doesn't make any sense to me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">I don't know that I want to understand it. And that becomes more of a problem, right? Because (laughs) for me often compassion comes through understanding. So there's also just sympathy for someone else's pain, but like really understanding where they're coming from and why helps me to -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">CLIENT: relate or something like that. I don't want to understand why she wanted to kill herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: I can't see why anyone would really want to (sigh) at least experientially understand it.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20076-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20076-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">THERAPIST: Mm. I'm not sure if I'm detouring us or not with this. But how do you understand the infidelity? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">CLIENT: (pause) (sigh) I think by extrapolation more than anything else. But like I have fallen in love before. I have been infatuated with people before. And certainly during Tanya and I's relationship I have found other people attractive. And so it's sort of like I can see how it would start in some <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B1\">sense. And it doesn't seem like where it got to is so radically different that I can't more or less understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">It's still like a breach of trust that is not a part of who I am. But I also have this sense of like I hold to commitments more firmly than many people. Tanya does also, but still it just like, I don't like, I don't know. Extrapolation I think is the answer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">CLIENT: But not far. Does that make sense?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">THERAPIST: So I see what you mean by understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">THERAPIST: (inaudible)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">CLIENT: I think I'm equivocating some.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Are you? I actually didn't think you were equivocating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">THERAPIST: But how do you think you're equivocating?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20091\">CLIENT: I think I'm I'm thinking being a little fussy with \"understand.\" I think I'm sort of moving a little bit between like \"understand by direct experience,\" and \"understand by extrapolation from experience.\" And I think I really want to mean the latter more than the former.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20093\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20095\">CLIENT: But I think they're somehow related for me. And there's some sense in which I just either can't or don't want to extrapolate to where Tanya has been. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20097\">I'm sorry. I've let you lead us through some interesting places. We're a little bit off the narrative I was telling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20099\">THERAPIST: I know. So please let's get back on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009B\">CLIENT: Okay. We don't have to. If you have more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009D\">THERAPIST: No. No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2009F\">CLIENT: I'm interested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A1\">THERAPIST: No. I had some thoughts but I realize we were doing that. I realized that I was potentially detouring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">CLIENT: Okay. I mean, I don't mind the detour. I just, when we're detouring I'm not steering the direction anymore and so (pause) Which I don't mind. Like that's not it's out of my control and I'm upset. It's a like I'm not going to start talking about the next thing because I'm interested in where <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A31\">you're taking this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Mm. I wasn't thinking about taking it anywhere in particular at first. I was more just thinking, because I actually don't think we talked that much about what sense you made of her infidelity, emotional, however, whatever. Infidelity seems like a good just sort of broad way of describing, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200A51\">you know, couching (ph) it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">I don't think we ever talked about that. I mean I sort of felt like I learned what happened, but not the meaning it had for you as much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">THERAPIST: So when you were making that comparison between understand one and not understanding the other, I thought, \"Well, I actually don't know how you understood that.\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">CLIENT: Okay. Do you have a better sense of that now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: No, actually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">THERAPIST: And then my mind went to just thinking about what questions you do and don't ask. Like the questions about last week. Like, \"Why are we going to your brothers graduation if he flunked out and that's why he's not graduating. Is that a celebration?\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B2-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">THERAPIST: You know like there's just certain questions that are not asked. Because like I I'm jumping around a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B9\">CLIENT: That's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB\">THERAPIST: So you can let me know if this is less helpful, but I'm just having a lot of thoughts. Like what you're saying is you can understand Tanya's infidelity in the context of having feelings about other women, other people in general, and so you can see why. But it's not quite the same as having <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200BB1\">an emotional affair with someone just before you're about to get married. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BD\">CLIENT: We were already married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200BF\">THERAPIST: Were you already married?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C3\">THERAPIST: I wasn't sure if it was right before the wedding or it was right after the wedding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C5\">CLIENT: So her feelings started to develop while she was at William &amp; Mary. A sort of, you know, a crush on an academic authority figure with whom you're working closely. That all makes like just good sense to me. It's really kind of who Tanya is in a lot of ways, to like fall in love easily and to <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200C51\">like authority figures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C7\">So there was no problem with her having some feelings for him. It started like after we were married I think, or maybe right before we were married. So she's longer his student directly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200C9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CB\">CLIENT: But she was working on editing a (inaudible at 00:22:51) that he was, like she was copyediting it and he was collecting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CD\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200CF\">CLIENT: And so somewhere in there he told her that he had feelings for her and she said that she had feelings for him, and it developed from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D1\">THERAPIST: I see. So for some reason I got the timeline slightly off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D3\">CLIENT: I'm not sure that the timeline matters too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D5\">THERAPIST: Well, you were married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D7\">CLIENT: Sorry?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200D9\">THERAPIST: You were married.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DB\">CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, yeah. (pause) So, I forget what the original question was now. What were we -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DD\">THERAPIST: Yeah. Well I was just thinking about what it means to understand. Like I was sort of just outlining your thought process about how you think about understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200DF\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E1\">THERAPIST: It's adjusting, I guess, in a sense that there's a lot that I don't understand about how you understood the that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E3\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E5\">THERAPIST: And not necessarily having feeling for someone else. You were saying since you understand that you understood her situation or what happened. I was saying they're not quite synonymous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E7\">CLIENT: No that's fair. There's a (pause) No, that's fair. I think there is still a piece of it that I really don't understand of just like how she could, (pause) how she could think it was okay to continue that relationship in that way once they had confessed feelings for each other. To continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E71\">to exchange any sort of correspondence on that subject. Like, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200E8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200E9\">So I guess I understand that more in the general category of making mistakes than in So I feel like I can understand the emotions part of it. I can understand the people make mistakes part of it, even if I don't get like, \"How could you do that?\" part. And so I can get close enough, I think. Or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200E91\">like that. Or close enough for me to deal with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EB\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200ED\">CLIENT: I think that's more correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200EE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EF\">THERAPIST: I see. So how you're thinking about it is less in terms of what her motivations were and more in terms of making mistakes, realizing that you've done There are different kinds of explanations. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200EE-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200EE-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F0\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F1\">CLIENT: Yeah, there really are. (pause) I mean there's a sense in which I understand her motivations in terms of she wanted to be married to me, but she also wanted to be in a relationship with her professor. And (pause), you know, phrasing it in that way makes it seem in some ways more directly relevant <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F11\">to the current problems where I see the issue as being one of like failing to resolve competing needs and wants, or wants or something like that. In a way that I don't know that I had recognized. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F3\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F4\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F5\">And I guess I can, in general, understand the idea of wanting more than one thing at once that is mutually incompatible. Does that make sense? Like I can understand that. And so I can I don't know. I guess I feel like the place that I put her feeling is in failing to resolve the competing desires <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200F51\">and responsibilities. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F6\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F7\">And it's just hard to construct a narrative where I can like understand that and can't exactly understand what has just happened. When in a sense it can be extracted to failing to resolve competing desires and responsibilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200F8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200F9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FA\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FB\">CLIENT: So I'm not sure whether that means that the explanation isn't correct, or whether I just have inconsistent positions. (pause) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FC\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. I was thinking, and this is not to psychoanalyze Tanya at all. It's to understand well not really \"not at all,\" but mostly not. (laughs) But to understand the meaning you make of her and you of yourself. I mean, I think that's one of the things that we're doing together is trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N200FD1\">to make meaning of what is otherwise a chaotic and seemingly meaningless experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200FE\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200FF\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20100\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20101\">THERAPIST: In the context of, you know, with your wife whom you, you know, hope to have a future with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20102\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20103\">CLIENT: Right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20104\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20105\">THERAPIST: I did think about the issue of responsibility. And again, this is really armchair psychology. But given the -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20106\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20107\">CLIENT: What do you mean by \"armchair psychology?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20108\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20109\">THERAPIST: Well meaning that you're sort of doing it like about something, you know, \"Well I think that,\" you know, I don't know, you know, \"Robert Downey Jr., really this is what's going on for him.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010D\">THERAPIST: And, you know. (laughs) That's sort of what I think about as armchair. You're kind of just making hypotheses about things you don't, people you don't obviously know, or not, whatever. Obviously, I've met Tanya. But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2010E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2010F\">CLIENT: Well, when my advisor speculates about other people's biomechanics, I feel like it carries a little more weight than when my mother does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20110\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20111\">THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess. I have to actually look up the definition of \"armchair psychology.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20112\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20113\">CLIENT: Sorry. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20115\">THERAPIST: No, that's okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20117\">CLIENT: Digression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: No, not at all. I was thinking about, you know, the context of the affair, the timing of it. Maybe there was something about just the responsibility of being a wife that felt overwhelming and it was her way of sort of retreating or being fearful or something. I don't know. But there's something <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201191\">about responsibility that she finds just incredibly overwhelming. And it's so interesting given who you are and your relationship to responsibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: You know, it's not that I never find responsibility overwhelming.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N2011A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2011F\">CLIENT: It's just that I have, I think I have a higher bar than she does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20121\">THERAPIST: I wasn't contrasting it in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20122\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20123\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20124\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20125\">THERAPIST: I think you have different You certainly have different relationships. That you have the polar opposites, I wouldn't necessarily say that, per se.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20127\">CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, that's a really interesting suggestion. (pause) The months planning the wedding were really horrible. She was finishing up her master's degree and also applying to graduate school. Itself kind of a demoralizing process in a lot of ways, and particularly in her field where I think <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201271\">at three hundred applicants and accept three people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20129\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B\">CLIENT: So that's sort of a just, you know, rough. (sigh) And we didn't necessarily make it easy on ourselves in part through not having a lot of money, and instead of trying to, you know, balance in some sense the needs of us and of our families. And we made up as the needs of our families, because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012B1\">I think there was a lot of that going on. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D\">Yeah, so Tanya was a wreck the week before the wedding. And (pause) yeah, I don't know how much of that related to her own like fears about marriage. Her parents' marriage not having been a happy one. And having, in a sense, ended catastrophically for her because her mother left her when she was eight, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2012D1\">in a sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2012F\">And so (long pause) certainly as an armchair explanation, I think it's a really good one. You know, it's hard to say whether it's really true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20131\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20133\">CLIENT: But it rings fairly true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20135\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20137\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's less helpful in some sense because I don't (pause) I don't know quite what the analogous piece of our current situation would be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20139\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: Not that there has to be one. Just it would've been really tidy if there had been. Or if -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Well, I'm not sure if this is analogous per se, but you do wonder whether she abdicated her responsibility to herself in her depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013F\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20141\">THERAPIST: And this question of how responsible should she be to you and should she be and have been to herself is something that weighs on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah. That is true. It's a place that perhaps some reality would be helpful. So if you have thoughts there that, I guess I would appreciate it. If you don't want to weigh in, that's okay too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20145\">THERAPIST: Mm. I'm happy to if I have thoughts about it. Reality about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20147\">CLIENT: In terms of like if you think there's a clear answer to how much responsibility someone bears for that sort of issue, then that is helpful. Does that make sense? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">CLIENT: Like I feel like you may have a professional judgment on the question, and I trust you and your professional judgment. So if you have one, I would really like to hear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Well, I really feel that's almost more of a moral question than it is a psychological one. It's only a psychological one to the extent to which someone has the capacity to bear it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014F\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20151\">THERAPIST: That's more Whether one should or not feels very much like a moral question. Whether one has the capacity to is somewhat of a more psychological question, of that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20155\">THERAPIST: The thing that bothered you, that it bothers you, which I understand and can especially relate to this in terms of responsibility or sort of how bad things got, is was she motivated to try? (laughs) Even if she was horribly affected (ph), was she motivated to try? And I think that you don't <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201551\">feel she was or certainly not enough. And the piece of responsibility that I think irks you. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N20154-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20154-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20156\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20157\">CLIENT: Hm. (pause) Yeah, I think that's probably right. Using the, \"How does that ring?\" test. So this is something that like she felt at some times. Like she was trying everything possible. You know, she tried whole bunch of different medications. She was doing a lot of therapy. These things continue <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201571\">to not work in some sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20159\">And so (pause) And so we would always come back to some crisis point. It would always come back to some crisis point of one kind or another. Not always suicidality, but often suicidality. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015B\">You know, we've talked about what someone can do and can't do. And we've talked about pulling an airplane.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2015F\">CLIENT: Really vivid image. And you might remember that I responded that, \"Well if I get together enough people it would move the airplane. And isn't that moving the airplane?\" I feel like I don't know to what extent it is fair to say, \"The airplane has to move. Figure out how to move it.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20161\">But I feel like that's what needs to happen in sort of the circumstances Tanya was in. And there's some way in which I don't think she was willing to do that in a non-local sense. In a sort of step back and solve the problem sense. (pause) So it's sort of like, yeah, she was willing to make small changes <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201611\">that were easy in some way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20163\">Like changing medications really sucks and it's hard, but in some sense it's easy to go to the doctor and she gives you a different medication. You take it and you do the tapering thing and it looks hard and it feels hard, but it's not dealing with any larger problem in some ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20165\">Unless, in fact, the larger problem is chemical, which then gets into like (pause) Then gets into theories of mind that I'm not sure that we have, we as a human community, have actual complete answers to. So it's easy to I think it gets easy to say that you're doing enough at that point because <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201651\">there's not a clear answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20167\">But in some other way, like there is a clear answer. If she's continuing to want to kill herself or self-injure very often, something is not good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20169\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016B\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's probably right. But maybe you can see from the direction, the running in all directions my explanation took, I don't know whether that's a fair thing to be upset about or not. It's like to what extent It's not true that she was not motivated to try at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F\">CLIENT: And so if she was unable to solve the problem one way or the other, does that mean that she wasn't motivated enough? (pause) Certainly my experience with most problems is that they have solutions if you work hard enough. Not all, but most. And so then at what point am I applying some, you know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2016F1\">really unfair criterion to a really hard time in her life. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">THERAPIST: Well there's fairness and then there's your feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">CLIENT: (sigh)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">THERAPIST: And they may overlap and they may not overlap. As I think is true with most people. (pause) I guess all feelings are fair. Expectations may be realistic or unrealistic depending on the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P8-N20174-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"7\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20174-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":9,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559580\" data-realpage=\"9\" data-page=\"9\">\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20177\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20179\">THERAPIST: Whatever feelings you have about that seem fair game at the very least. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017B\">CLIENT: Fair enough. Yeah, we talked some about fencing and sort of coaching friends fencing on the strip. And how I can sort of inspire them to do what they really want to do but don't feel able to do at the time. And you suggested, by analogy in some sense, that Tanya didn't want to be doing okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2017F\">CLIENT: This was some months ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20181\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20183\">CLIENT: Okay. We've talked a lot. It's okay if you don't remember everything.

That's right. And sort of like one of the things that frustrated me most is when I feel like Tanya is intractable in some ways. So it's like Sean was very tractable in the sense that like I could find words that helped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2018F\">CLIENT: There are many times when Tanya is just utterly intractable. There's nothing I can do to buoy her mood at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20191\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20193\">CLIENT: And so it's definitely at times like those that I feel like there's some sense in which she's not even trying. And that's not accurate. (laughs) In some sense the low bar level, she didn't kill herself so she was trying. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20195\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20197\">CLIENT: But -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P9-N20199\">THERAPIST: We're going to [I want to let you know.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019B\">CLIENT: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P9-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P9-N2019D\">THERAPIST: We're going to need to end today.
