Come on in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: (pause) Oh, these are for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: Oh, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: The bank mailed me an overdraft statement, so I thought I\u2019d give you a copy of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Okay, but... here. (client affirms) I assume you... that is correct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Okay, thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: On the issue of trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) So I... took Tanya to the ER yesterday, so she\u2019s back in Frederick now. I walked with her, I didn\u2019t make the decision, I just went with her. So... (pause) that\u2019s happening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">(pause 00:01:03 to 00:01:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">So it seems like this... that a string of episodes, episode, has been going on for a week and a half or so. She had been dealing with suicidality. She wasn\u2019t working last week, because they were out of town, and so she had the week off (the family she nannies for). So she saw Chad every day. I feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F1\">like they were in, he was closely monitoring the situation, so... Monday of this week they... Is that the right day? Yeah, Monday of this week... Today is Wednesday. They... He decided that things were bad enough that he thought she needed to at least go to the ER, and be there for a while to be safe, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F2\">and then have them assess her in a few hours, because these tend to get bad and then drop back off, and she\u2019s okay again. That\u2019s kind of the normal pattern. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">So we walked from his office in the Square to the Andover Hospital, just, not very far, but, you know, it takes 15 minutes or something so... By the time we got there, she... felt like going in was ridiculous, which was sort of, one of the metrics as to whether like, this is the, actually the right <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">course of action. Like, if you\u2019re there for a while, and then it starts to feel absurd that you\u2019re there, then maybe it\u2019s okay to not be there, or to not do the full hospitalization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">So she called him, they talked for a minute and... he said, \u201cOkay, well, go on home, I\u2019ll see you in the morning anyway,\u201d because they had an appointment Tuesday morning. So they... So she... packed our filet knife with her in her bag, because she goes to work on Tuesday. So she was going to go see <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">Chad, and then go to work, and afterwards, she was going to drive out somewhere and cut her wrists. So she ended up not doing that and instead, giving the knife to Chad. Then I walked her from there to the Andover Hospital. We sat in the ER for a while, and moved to the Psych ER, and then she\u2019s at Frederick <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200232\">now, so... (pause) It seemed vaguely important to... give you the facts. So I did. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, that\u2019s part of what happened, and then there is what\u2019s happening in you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">(pause 00:05:12 to 00:06:00)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">CLIENT: So I, we\u2019ve done this a few times, and I sort of expected that to be, you know, your response would be somewhere in that line. So I was sort of wondering why I felt like starting with the facts was the important thing anyway. I still think it is. But... that came to mind, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">(pause 00:06:23 to 00:06:58)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">Anyway, so I\u2019m sad today. Yesterday... was crisis day, right? So it\u2019s, for me that\u2019s the easy day. It\u2019s easy to do what needs to be done, just continue on. What needed to be done there was go, and to be with her, and listen when she wanted to talk and... At this point there is not anything that she <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D1\">can say about suicide, I don\u2019t know, that I haven\u2019t heard from her already. It\u2019s... (chuckles) it\u2019s complicated, because she doesn\u2019t remember... the worst of the suicidal events, because of the CT (ph), so she just like, we\u2019re at Frederick and she hasn\u2019t... (chuckles) it feels vaguely familiar to her, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D2\">but... She spent about a month there, but doesn\u2019t remember it at all. That\u2019s weird. I remember it very clearly. So... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562672\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">It\u2019s sort of like I know, more or less, exactly what her routine is going to be like from day to day, but she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like there, so it\u2019s... But again, that\u2019s easy, like that situation is easy for me. Today, you know, I\u2019m sad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">(pause 00:08:31 to 00:08:59)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">I haven\u2019t really hit despair yet, at least not for any length of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">(pause 00:09:05 to 00:09:27)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">If I weren\u2019t coming here, it would have been a lot harder to get up this morning. I would have, eventually, but...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">(pause 00:09:35 to 00:10:20)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I\u2019m also glad I\u2019m here. I... (pause) I... Yeah, I feel safe here and I feel like you... already know most of my response to this, in some sense, and I know that whatever response I have is okay here. So, thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: (pause) I\u2019m sorry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">CLIENT: Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">(pause 00:11:23 to 00:11:55) (sighs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: I imagine this is upsetting and discouraging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: (pause) It\u2019s definitely upsetting. Yeah, it\u2019s... discouraging is probably right, but I, it\u2019s like... this doesn\u2019t seem... I mean, A) it doesn\u2019t seem as bad as it\u2019s been other times. It\u2019s like she is more able to cope with the suicidal ideation and feelings and thoughts like, this is, it seems <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200451\">pretty clear that this is a place that she goes when she gets overwhelmed. But that... I think largely through some distance from some of the most acute original causes and some, and a whole lot of work and therapy with Chad, she is more able to cope with... with the stress or the whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">But unlike, with any particular medication, where like, the claim is essentially like, your mood should be, our mood stabilizing needs to be (ph) compressed, such that you don\u2019t have large swings in this direction. There is no particular claim in that direction with psychotherapy, right? Like, this <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">is not, this is not overturning the theory of what\u2019s going on in any way like, she\u2019s overwhelmed. (pause) I feel like... you know, the way she describes it, she has to decide every... ten minutes, or hour, not to kill herself. That seems like it would be hard, and, if you\u2019re doing that for a week, I <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200472\">feel like... it would be harder to keep making the same decision, so I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">So in that sense, I\u2019m not discouraged about like... I think that\u2019s probably a part of... I don\u2019t feel like the course of treatment that she\u2019s on is ruined, or wrecked, or broken, or failing, even. It\u2019s like, this is a bad thing that has happened, but it\u2019s sort of in the range of expected values. The <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">other side of that is like, you and I talk a lot about trust, and particularly in the last couple of months, we\u2019ve talked a lot about it. So, you know, one of the themes we haven\u2019t exactly sorted out is like, this sort of, you can trust anyone or you can trust no one. There is some space in the middle <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200492\">where it\u2019s probably better to live, but... <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562672\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">It seems to me like we\u2019re agreed that there are people who are trustworthy, or there are things that are trustworthy. Maybe I misestimate what those are, but... it\u2019s a lot harder to... (chuckles) It\u2019s a lot harder to trust someone who doesn\u2019t want to live, because fundamentally, we\u2019re back in this place <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B1\">where like, I know she\u2019s suicidal and so I trust her alone less. I trust her ability to deal with her own moods less, so I\u2019m going to trust her with mine? That\u2019s, you know, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s (chuckles) the right response, but that\u2019s certainly one I have, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: (pause) I guess I used the word \u201cdiscouraging\u201d because I think one is discouraged when one is expecting something to go in one direction and it goes in another direction. Maybe I\u2019m... imputing that to the situation. Maybe you weren\u2019t feeling that way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: (pause) I think... (sighs) There has been a strange element this time around, where like, I have not felt like this is a thing in my control, and that\u2019s been okay. Like... (pause) The phrase that\u2019s kind of come to mind several times is that \u201cthis is not about me,\u201d which is sort of a weird... <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F1\">phrase anyway, and a little weirder in this context. But it sort of gets at the... the feeling like... (pause) Yeah, I can\u2019t fix her, I can\u2019t fix this for her. There are some things I can do to help, and I\u2019ve tried to do them. But... yeah. I don\u2019t know, I guess I don\u2019t... <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">(pause) I feel like a year ago that I had a larger sense of like, \u201cI have to do something about this,\u201d or something, but I don\u2019t have that sense now. I think that\u2019s a good thing, and some of that I, it concerns me like, maybe I... I don\u2019t care about her in some way, or something. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200511\">really true, but that... I think for the most part, it\u2019s mostly like, this is actually not a thing I can control, and so... wanting to control it is not really... (chuckles) helpful or useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: (pause) That is a big change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">(pause 00:19:05 to 00:19:56)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think it concerns me, because I think that there is a... there is a... part of me that... sort of feels like, \u201cWell, at least if she killed herself, I could deal with that, and it would solve the problem of... do I leave her or do I stay in this particularly horrible situation that\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200571\">not always horrible, but is tough.\u201d (chuckles) I\u2019m not particularly happy about that part of me, but I sort of understand it, so... I actually think it\u2019s a good thing to feel like this is not in my control, and that I shouldn\u2019t be trying to control it. But that other piece, I don\u2019t know. Seemed related <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200572\">and bothers me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">THERAPIST: (pause) That you feel that way? (client affirms) (pause) Well, it speaks to... maybe a burden you feel about not knowing what to do and what this means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">(pause 00:21:47 to 00:22:07)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right, I think that\u2019s right. Yeah. Because it\u2019s sort of like, \u201cWell, at least the burden would be gone, so...\u201d Short way of saying it, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">(pause 00:22:21 to 00:23:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">Are you okay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">THERAPIST: Yeah. (chuckles) What was your concern?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">CLIENT: Um, yeah, so (sighs), I, of course, would have the concern anyway, right? Because I feel like I have to take care of you. But I respond to that, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay. (chuckles) I don\u2019t need to take care of you. I need to be here so that you can take care of me.\u201d And thank you for that. But then <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200651\">you sighed, and so you\u2019ve... You\u2019ve sighed twice in this session, and you don\u2019t usually sigh, so it was sort of a, you know... so I asked. Here we are.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N20064-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20064-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562672\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20067\">THERAPIST: I feel sad about the situation, and I feel sad for you. I can feel with you. I can imagine, or try to imagine, the weight of that burden is. So I have all of those feelings, but I also feel okay, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20069\">CLIENT: Hmm! Thank you. So why? (chuckles) Why would you imagine that? (pause) I understand why, but, and thank you for doing it, but that... that seems like a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006B\">(pause 00:25:00 to 00:26:30)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006D\">So I... feel less sad than I did when I got here. Thank you. And we also have some more time, so I would be interested in talking about other things, if that seems okay to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2006F\">THERAPIST: This is your space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20071\">CLIENT: (chuckles) I don\u2019t have any particular thing, you know. Just I feel like we have been... not on a perfectly linear path, we\u2019re kind of following several themes for several weeks. I would prefer to hold onto that somewhat, if possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20073\">(pause) So I feel like we left off last week talking about, very briefly, raising the subject of like, my sensitivity to other people. (pause) I\u2019ve also had this... sense in the last couple of sessions that, or feeling that... as if you have been trusting me more, which I thought it would be interesting <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200731\">to mention. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20075\">THERAPIST: Trusting you in what ways?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20077\">CLIENT: I feel like you\u2019ve been more open about what you\u2019re thinking, or what you do or think about it. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s actually accurate, but that\u2019s how I, how I feel, so that seemed like... I actually think that some of the things you\u2019ve said, you said before, so it\u2019s not like... So, I... <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200771\">anyway, I don\u2019t know exactly where the feeling comes from, but it seemed important to mention. (pause) I like it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20079\">(pause 00:28:50 to 00:29:41)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007B\">It\u2019s weird, it feels, you know... artificial, like I\u2019m trying to force the conversation in a particular direction that\u2019s not... (pause) And then I\u2019m having a hard time adjusting that I...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007D\">THERAPIST: (pause) Well, do you feel like you\u2019re trying to move away from the topic of Tanya being re-hospitalized?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2007F\">CLIENT: I didn\u2019t when I started doing it. I actually did feel better. It\u2019s sort of like I, in trying to move away, I felt like it\u2019s been harder to access the other space, or something like that. Yeah, so...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20081\">(pause 00:31:10 to 00:31:33)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20083\">Feels sort of like I\u2019m trying to maintain something that\u2019s... eclipsed right now. (pause) I keep trying anyway. So, one of the things that I did remember wondering, after we talked last week was, do you think of yourself as a scientist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20085\">THERAPIST: Not really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20087\">CLIENT: Do you think of yourself as a medical professional?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P4-N20089\">THERAPIST: No. Definitely not that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B\">CLIENT: Interesting. Okay. So the analogy that sort of came to mind last week, or afterwards, was that it was like you are a scientist whose instrument was herself, because you were talking sort of both feeling and watching yourself feel things, and using that as the... I thought that was very interesting. <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008B1\">It seems really hard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I think this, you know, I don\u2019t think of myself as a scientist, but I think in a very broad definition, sure. Like, that fits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F\">CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t particularly need you to be a scientist. I think you\u2019re more of a wizard than a scientist, anyway, but... I just... that was the analogy that had been, sort of comes to me, because I know a lot of people who, you know, do one instrument or something, sort of get to know <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N2008F1\">the instrument very well. So I was curious.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"3\"><span data-id=\"P4-N2008E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":5,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562672\" data-realpage=\"5\" data-page=\"5\">\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20091\">THERAPIST: And the medical professional part?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20093\">CLIENT: That was actually just, I don\u2019t know. You said no to scientist and it, that question popped in my head, so I asked it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20095\">(pause 00:33:32 to 00:34:12)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20097\">THERAPIST: But a wizard is something altogether different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20099\">CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. You know, there is, there are all sorts of sort of pithy responses to that, right? The old, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, or... you know, the methods the alchemists followed were pretty similar to the methods that early chemists followed, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200991\">or pretty similar to the ones we follow now. It\u2019s just some information content difference. Yeah, it\u2019s altogether different, but I feel like... people, and the things people do, and things we care about are kind of... more similar than we talk about, across time and professions. But yeah, it is an altogether <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200992\">different description, or way of conceptualizing, what you do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t think of my primary care doctor as a wizard. (client chuckles) He can be very helpful. (client laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009D\">(pause 00:35:45 to 00:36:21)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P5-N2009F\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t think of your primary care doctor as a wizard, either, but... We\u2019ve talked about this before. It\u2019s one of the... worse analogies that I\u2019ve used, because it\u2019s more opaque (ph) for you, I think, so it\u2019s...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A1\">THERAPIST: Well, it certainly has a particular connotations, usually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A3\">CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. I don\u2019t think I need all of the connotations that it has, so... But...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Well, is it, when I think of wizard, I think of magic, there is usually magic involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A7\">CLIENT: Sure, sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200A9\">(pause 00:37:00 to 00:37:36)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB\">Yeah, then we\u2019re back to... magic being often things that are not well understood by the person who thinks they are magic. But, that\u2019s not... that\u2019s the less important part. I think the more important part is that like, for the person for whom the wizard is doing something that... there need not be <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB1\">any magic. There just, there is the... I don\u2019t know... (pause) you know, even in a like, purely physical world, there is something going on in that interaction that is important. You know, it gets particularly problematic in the context of most magicians are also tricksters, which I don\u2019t really, but <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N200AB2\">that\u2019s not an implication, because most magic isn\u2019t actually magic. But... yeah, that\u2019s also not really a piece that I meant there, so... Yeah, particularly poor, as analogies go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AD\">(pause) Because I neither understand, nor need to understand, everything about what we do in order for it to be helpful or very real, so... (pause) I also would like to understand most of what we\u2019re doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Because you\u2019re a scientist?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B1\">CLIENT: Or maybe they both come from the same... piece of me. I am a scientist and I care about that, because of who I am, you know. (pause) See, I also don\u2019t think of myself as a scientist, although I very much am, in terms of like...<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B3\">(pause 00:40:01 to 00:40:57)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B5\">THERAPIST: What are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B7\">CLIENT: Um, so initially I was expecting you to tell me the time was up, because I sort of thought that was a thing that you would respond to, because you went through several \u201cHmm\u2019s.\u201d Then we were looking at each other and you kept doing that.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200B6-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562672\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P6-N200B9\">THERAPIST: Time is almost up, but we still have like, a minute.
