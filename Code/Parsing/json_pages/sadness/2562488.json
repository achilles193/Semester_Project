Well it turned out the meeting with Geoffrey was really good. Yes, he\u2019s just a really good person and pretty much sort of more pragmatic in a cold-hearted way. I\u2019m really glad I\u2019m not in his shoes. He passed his exams, which is awesome, and now he\u2019s trying to get a dissertation prospectus <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">up and running and he\u2019s basically just doing that without any consultation or advice. And [inaudible at 00:01:01] his advisor is on sabbatical this year and is going to come back for a year and maybe a semester next year and then he\u2019s going to retire. But they don\u2019t know when and whether that position <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">is going to be replaced. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">Vincent Deloitte (ph) is the archeologist. His chair has not been filled yet and I don\u2019t think (ph) there\u2019s a surge underway yet; I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing anything about it. So yes, the department continues to crumble. So wow (ph) out of that one. But he seems like he\u2019s doing okay with it. He\u2019s pretty <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200111\">sturdy in that sense. I\u2019m sort of thinking man he would\u2019ve done so he would be so happy at William &amp; Tanya. That makes me sort of sad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">So we talked; it was good to visit. Man I can\u2019t tell what the weather\u2019s going to do today but I feel like I might be dressed wrong for it. Oh well. I did not want to get up this morning as usual. [Pause] Yes, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s good to be reminded that that thing that I miss doesn\u2019t actually exist. Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">But I really miss the work. Geoffrey sat talking about his topics and interests. I was thinking I\u2019m both so far out of that world that I couldn\u2019t really have a productive conversation with him. It was more like tell me what you\u2019re doing. But it\u2019s just so much fun. I just miss it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">Anyway then we got back home and I had to do taxes and insurance and stuff that stresses me out. But that got done. We have to yet again file a grievance over how they billed the ambulance that took me out to Frederick because of course they called somebody who\u2019s not in network so they charged me the <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200191\">copay for in network but I\u2019m not in a position to call somebody who\u2019s in network. So they\u2019re basically listing it as a non-emergency situation when it\u2019s an emergency situation. And the last time this happened, you file agreements, they approved it and it was fine. It\u2019s just sort of frustrating but this <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200192\">is what we do. So we did that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">Yes, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know what to talk about. I feel like I\u2019ve been in the same situation at the start of every week recently. I get to the end of the week and I think I\u2019m really tired. I don\u2019t want to go back to work; don\u2019t know what to do. In previous weeks it\u2019s worked out okay so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">Started looking at job postings for church schools, churches last night. I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s not much there. There\u2019s a school in Delaware that\u2019s looking for a they\u2019re hiring for two religion teachers but it\u2019s in Delaware. I hate Delaware. And James hates Delaware a lot more than I do. So I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">It\u2019s much easier to be applying or thinking about applying for a position; it\u2019s having a job even if it\u2019s not a very good one too than not having a job. I cleaned out my closet, which benefits no one but me, but it was very satisfactory anyway. I\u2019m really good at putting things in closets; there\u2019s an <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200231\">incredible amount of stuff in there. [Laughs] I took everything out and put everything back in. Now I take everything out today the entire apartment was full of stuff. We\u2019ve gotten pretty efficient in our use of space or storage space anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20022-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20022-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562488\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20025\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">It sort of feels like, I don\u2019t know I sort of felt this week like I can put the engine in neutral but I can\u2019t turn it off. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s hard for me to go to bed and then when I wake up I\u2019m up; it\u2019s hard for me to go back to sleep if I wake up early because I woke up at 4:00 this morning and <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200271\">it was hard for me to get back to sleep. I don\u2019t know but I\u2019m just tired all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see, sure. It\u2019s as though you\u2019re kind of keyed up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yes. It\u2019s weird. Just a little bit, not a whole lot. I did end up going back to sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">I did make pancakes most of the day on Saturday but I feel like that was a long time ago. Then I went to bed. It\u2019ll be good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: What? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: I just said it\u2019ll be good; this week will be fine. [Pause] So last night I stayed up late because I started typing up the minutes from a meeting from church. And I volunteered to be the scribe or the person who takes notes. It\u2019s really easy to take notes; typing up the notes is the pain in the <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200331\">ass probably because previous people have flushed them out into complete sentences and I don\u2019t want to do that. And then I, yes. But so it took me a long time to write those up. And then I couldn\u2019t get to sleep. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">When I was little I always used to tell myself stories when I was going to sleep. Like pick [inaudible at 00:16:12] whatever I was reading at the time. I always got, I\u2019d have an idea of where it was going in my head and I got a tenth of the way through and I fell asleep so I\u2019d have to start over again <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200351\">the next night. So then it turned into this weird thing where I was trying to go to sleep but also trying to stay awake to finish the story but I don\u2019t know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told anybody that. [Pause] More less than now I would just think about people that I find soothing. It\u2019s a short list. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">I\u2019ve never been good actually at making up stories. I don\u2019t know why. When I\u2019ve done creative writing I just can\u2019t come up with plots that are not the stories I have already read. Tell the same story ten times. [Pause] It\u2019s one of the reasons I don\u2019t write a lot of fiction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003F\">THERAPIST: There is something that\u2019s very [inaudible at 00:24:01]. It can be hard to know what to say or have access to or talk about the things that matter particularly when you\u2019re feeling more okay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">CLIENT: Yes. It sort of feels like I have the option of being more guarded so of course I\u2019m going to take that. Yes, I have some sort of feeling it\u2019s maybe not what you\u2019re looking for, which is I\u2019m laughing because as I say it I\u2019m thinking yes, that\u2019s a problem Tanya. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">THERAPIST: Wait, what? I\u2019m not sure -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">CLIENT: I guess -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: As far as I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re supposed to be different from that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: Yes I guess so. I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s something about if there\u2019s not something that clearly needs to be fixed than I don\u2019t have a place here or I would not be welcomed. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20048-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20048-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562488\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Well it seems to be more a struggle or at least more two-sided seems to me than your simply being guarded. I mean you have said a bunch of stuff including the stuff about the stories and that you haven\u2019t said that to anyone and thinking of people you find soothing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">CLIENT: Yes. I guess I\u2019m sort of worried to see what you\u2019re going to do with that. That was the best thing in my life for a while. And now it\u2019s the best part of the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">THERAPIST: Telling yourself stories where you\u2019re going?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20055\">CLIENT: Sort of like they\u2019re reading all the time. And then I didn\u2019t ever want to stop reading. Yes partly in a good way and partly in a bad way. Bad way because I didn\u2019t want to be in my life but also I really liked the stories I was reading; that was really good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20057\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20059\">I guess I mean because these terrible schmaltzy fan-vic type stories. I knew that\u2019s what they were but that\u2019s okay. They\u2019re not for anybody else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005B\">THERAPIST: I wonder if they were, I guess I\u2019m thinking about them as daydreams? And that in that way they were one of the few things in the day that felt like it was for you? Or maybe it is still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D\">CLIENT: Mark gave a sermon a while back about, he was talking about his daydreams as a kid and he was talking about the Secret Life of Walter Mitty, which is this great story. And he was saying that in his daydreams he was always the center of attention and other people didn\u2019t matter very much. Talking <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2005D1\">about that like coming to a better in his daydreams he was a great humanitarian but other people didn\u2019t actually matter. He said so maybe helping people is totally different from that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2005F\">It was a nice sermon but it was striking for me because in my daydreams it was always about relationships. It was always being close to people in ways that I wasn\u2019t close to people in real life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20061\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20063\">[inaudible at 00:32:32] coming. [Pause] Which isn\u2019t to say that the other people were these terribly fully realized characters but they don\u2019t I don\u2019t know actually because I take people from books or people that I knew and those were real people for me. I was really lonely. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20065\">THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:34:23]. [Pause] I guess they were safe too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20067\">CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I always knew what was going to happen. [Pause] Shared the same books over and over again. I like knowing what\u2019s going to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20069\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006B\">THERAPIST: And maybe in a way you were making yourself aware of what you were missing, like companionship and predictability. What I have in mind is you\u2019re hungry, so hungry, and dreaming of cake or a sandwich.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006D\">CLIENT: Yes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2006F\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20071\">CLIENT: Yes. I used to always imagine that I\u2019d be in perilous situations and imagine that that wouldn\u2019t hurt me. It\u2019s sort of exaggerated versions of things that actually did hurt me a lot, like the theft. I don\u2019t know <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: Well it\u2019s nice to feel safe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">CLIENT: Yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">[Pause]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: We should finish up for now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
