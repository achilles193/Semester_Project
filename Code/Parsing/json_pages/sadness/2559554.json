Okay, great. Thank you very much. Well I'm glad this worked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: Yeah, me too. Me too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: So how are you doing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: Better than I was. This weekend was a little tough as multiple friends kept disappointing me. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: You know, I went out with some friends on Friday night and that was really great. But then my friend who was supposed to come up from back home ended up having work issues, and so she couldn't make it up here. But I had some good \"me\" time which was good still.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: So that worked out. But, yeah, I'm feeling much better than I was on Friday. You know, there's still those moments. (laughs) You know, I think especially when I go to bed and wake up and when I come home there's those moments where, you know, it's just you hit that wall again. And it's like, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B1\">\"Oh yeah, this has changed.\" (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: We actually got together for dinner last night and, you know, we both had a good time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So that's good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: But, yeah, you know I still have I pretty much feel I've processed everything though I still have these fears of, you know, being alone after being with someone for five years. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: It's a little scary to go back to that aloneness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Can you say more about that scariness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: Well, um, I mean when I first moved up here, you know, I was still not fully aware and comfortable with myself as I was still figuring a lot of stuff out personally and about my life. And, you know, I pretty much had very (sigh) I wouldn't say I didn't have much of a social life, because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F1\">had a social life, but it wasn't I still spent a lot of times in my apartment just me and I'm afraid of going back to that. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">It gets very quiet around the apartment and I've grown very comfortable and fond of having that someone there. And Liam and I we clicked on so many levels (laughs) that I worry about finding someone like him who has a lot of the same interests as I have. The two of us have some specific interests where <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200311\">there's just a small pool of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">THERAPIST: Mm. Like what?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">CLIENT: Well. (laughs) One of the things I thought he was [bringing up] (ph) at some point. Well we're both \"furries.\" (laughs) You know, people obsessed with anthropomorphic animals and fondness of, you know, all things, you know, Looney Tunes (laughs) and, you know, feel a connection to animals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">THERAPIST: Is that an actual term? Furries?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">CLIENT: It is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">THERAPIST: And it refers to anthropomorphizing animals?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">CLIENT: Anthropomorphizing animals. You know, a lot of our friends are people in the \"furry fan-dom\" as they call it. And, you know, it's people who like drawing art of anthropomorphized animal characters. And some go as far as having costumes that they spend lots of money on. And so that's something <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D1\">we were both into and one of the ways we met.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">And it's the type of thing that I know has sort of a negative public image, no thanks to the media. (laughs) And so, you know, I fear, you know, finding, and obviously I'm not at that stage where I'm actively looking for a new person. But I fear thinking, when I think down the road, you know, finding <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">someone else with the similar interest or accepting of, open minded about this stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003E-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559554\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. When you shared this together, would it be watching things together? Role playing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20043\">CLIENT: Um. I wouldn't (sigh) You know, a lot of his friends were from D.C. since he lived out there. And, you know, and we always went to, there's conventions all over the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20045\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">CLIENT: But we always went to this one in D.C. where a lot of his friends were. It's basically (laughs), one way we describe it to people who come up to us at conventions, it's a good reason to get together, drink and have fun. (laughs) It's really a bad way to put it, but it's a common interest in, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200471\">you know, art, literature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">CLIENT: You know, yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Were there other interests that you shared that you feel would be hard to find in your new partner? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: Um. (sucks teeth) Yeah. Um. It's (laughs, sighs, laughs) It's This one's a little iffy and I'm not quite sure about sharing this one. (pause, sighs) It's something else that has a bit of a negative image. (sigh) And it actually, it's (laughs) got another small group (laughs) of, an even <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F1\">smaller group of people interested in it. But it turns a lot of people off and <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">THERAPIST: I'm open to hearing anything, but you should share with me over a time when you feel comfortable. I'm open to hearing anything and I've heard a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: (laughs) No, I know, I'm sure you probably have heard it all. (laughs) But we'll save that one for another session I think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: But that's, you know, that's where my fears are right now is, you know, like I said it's not like I'm actively at that point where I'm I shouldn't be out there looking for somebody right now because that would be a step in the wrong direction for processing things. But, you know, thinking <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B1\">down the line I just think about, \"Gee, will I ever find another person with these same interests that are a big part of my life and was a big part of our life.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. How old were you when you moved here?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: I was I had just turned eighteen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: [I see. Oh.] (ph)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I came up here for school. So yeah, I had just turned eighteen. And when I met Liam I had just turned twenty two maybe?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: I think so. I think I had just turned twenty two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: You alluded to, maybe I got this incorrectly, that he was like your Was he your first gay relationship, or just your first significant relationship?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: I would say really significant relationship. I had a couple of, you know, flings before him and, you know, it wasn't anything substantial. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: And when we met I don't believe either of us were really looking for something, but it just happened because, you know, we had that connection. We had so much in common, so many of these interests, and we had fun together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">And, you know, it's funny because I tell people, we tell people the story of how we met and, you know, we were talking online one night. He didn't like the way I typed online because I use a lot of, you know, instant message shorthand. And so he ignored me for six months and then one night he had a <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200711\">little bit to drink and sent me a message saying, \"Hey, we should hang out one night or one day.\" And the rest is history. (laughs) You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20070-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20070-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559554\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20073\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">CLIENT: We hung out a lot and really clicked. And it was a click that I had never met someone who shared so much with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20077\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. You had also mentioned, I think, in one of the sessions that you really felt at ease with his family and welcomed and that it was a contrast to your family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20078\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20079\">CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) I finally came out to my family, um, (pause) two and half years now? Yeah, maybe two and half years ago now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">CLIENT: You know, my parents had already met him as my \"roommate\" and, you know, one weekend, one summer, I went down and had the talk. And they weren't too receptive of it. And eventually they came around. I still think they're in slight denial and I think they're going to see this as a, \"Oh maybe <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D1\">he'll come home with a girl next time.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">CLIENT: But I honestly don't care what they think. I've never given much thought to what they think. But one of the things I meant a lot when I had said that was, you know, my mother after knowing him for so many years now, and knowing him as my partner for a few years now, you know, she's just now <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200811\">finally coming around (laughs) to liking him or at least accepting him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">And, you know, his family has, even though his family We, up until this, this was the unspoken You know, his family they just never just talked about Liam and I. You know? They knew. (laughs) They definitely knew. I mean they never questioned why the two of us lived in apartments with one bed. And <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">why, you know, when two people buy a condo together. They knew. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: But it was never talked about it. And his family from day one they just welcomed me with open arms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">CLIENT: And it was a really, really nice feeling. (laughs) I mean, I think I pushed for us to do things with his family more than he wanted to at times. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008F\">CLIENT: Just because it was nice to have that connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20090\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20091\">THERAPIST: Are your parents supportive of you in other ways? Or is this consistent with not being as supportive as you'd like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">CLIENT: Um. (sniffs) I wouldn't say they I wouldn't say they've fully supported me in some of my decisions throughout life. And, you know, it's (laughs) one of the reasons why halfway through medical school I switched my major to a degree that would get me out of there quickly. And I'm now going for <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200931\">my education degree because, you know, they for some reason wanted me to become an doctor. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">And, you know, I always joke. You know? I voiced other interests and, you know, pushing your visually impaired son to become an doctor is really (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Odd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: A little bit. (laughs) A little bit. And when I got a nice promotion in my previous office that put me working more in the office, you know, my mother (laughs), I always joke, the classic mother response. You know, not, \"Hey, good job. That sounds great.\" But rather, \"Well are you going to finish school?\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: It's like, \"Well, why wouldn't I finish I school?\" (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: I wouldn't say halfway I was part of the town recreational football team growing up. And I played one year in high school and I decided to leave after that, just because high school took the fun out of it because there's not so much emphasis on having fun. And, you know, my mother when I told <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200A11\">her wasn't very supportive and, you know, trying to find the reasons why. While my father was, you know, more or less, \"Whatever.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200A0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559554\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A3\">So I would say, \"yes,\" my parents have never one hundred percent supportive of things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A5\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. That wanting you to be an doctor with your visual impairment, I mean, that's Do you have insight into? Is that them or is that just kind of inexplicable?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A7\">CLIENT: Inexplicable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200A9\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AB\">CLIENT: I mean, I think at some point I voiced interest into, this was probably the beginning of my senior year in high school, I voiced interest in doing something else. You know, at one point I was thinking \"Education,\" at one point I was thinking \"Culinary Arts.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD\">And I think my mother's response to the second one, \"Culinary Arts,\" was that, \"Well why don't I just call up the guidance counselor and just, you know, tell her she should process everything for you to go straight into like a VoTech school. Instead of, you know, there's no use in graduating if that's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200AD1\">all you want to do. And it's like, you know, \"Gee.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B1\">CLIENT: Thanks for I think that's possibly why I was afraid to say something to Liam when I notice things not going in a good direction.

Were you born with the visual impairment?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's part of the whole package.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">CLIENT: And so from day one I was. (pause) But they've always been pushing me into (inaudible at 00:19: 48) play volleyball. That was never fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Because of your vision or because you weren't very good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: Because I wasn't very good because of my vision. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BF\">THERAPIST: I see. What is your vision like? How impaired is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C1\">CLIENT: I mean I can drive. I can't Seeing fine details such as reading things far away, seeing a volleyball coming at me very quickly and knowing when to swing are difficult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">CLIENT: You know, I can see your cup on the table and I see it's got a ring around it, and that's basically the most detail I can see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">THERAPIST: I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C9\">CLIENT: From this distance. So (pause) eventually I stopped playing volleyball which, that was nice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">THERAPIST: Do you feel that they weren't accepting of your differences?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD\">CLIENT: No I think they were very pushing of it. Well, not pushing of it. I think they did not really know how to deal with it in a more supportive way. You know, knowing, I think they always wanted me to try and have a regular life. You know, \"Go out there. Play sports like regular kids do.\" And it's <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CD1\">like, I can't really do what regular kids do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D0\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D1\">CLIENT: And it frustrated me at times because, you know, it's just I'm out there and I cannot see the ball coming at me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D5\">CLIENT: (laughs) I don't know when to swing. (pause) Yeah. It caused for many awkward moments, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D7\">THERAPIST: With them or just -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200D8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200D9\">CLIENT: With me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DB\">THERAPIST: With the situations that they put you in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DD\">CLIENT: With the situations I was put in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200DE\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200DF\">THERAPIST: I see.

I keep going back to that specific, you know, comparison.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N200F2\"><span data-id=\"P5-N200F3\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.

Do you feel like that nervousness, is that sort of a generalized nervousness or only sort of particular to being in new situations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20114\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20115\">CLIENT: I'm not sure. I mean, I think one of the things I previously said was, you know, I'll bring something to my boss for review and, if we're going invoices together because I do the billing and, you know, he'll be looking at something and just really analyzing it. And I'm just waiting for him to, <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201151\">you know, completely blow up over something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20116\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20117\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20119\">CLIENT: And I don't know why he would have reason too.

I forgot if we, I forget, I apologize if we talked about this before about if you've been in therapy before? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P5-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20131\">CLIENT: Once before. I'd say maybe four years ago or something. It just didn't work out to me. I was trying The main reason I wanted to go was to work on, you know, some of the things we were just talking about such as, you know, general nervousness and anxiety. But also ways of better expressing <\/span><span data-id=\"P5-N201311\">myself more openly.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P5-N20130-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"4\"><span data-id=\"P5-N20130-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":6,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559554\" data-realpage=\"6\" data-page=\"6\">\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">And, you know, I was having, I had been employed at the first office I worked at. I was working there for six years before leaving last June. So that's since March of 2006 is when I had started working there. And at that point my previous (ph) therapist, you know, I wasn't very happy there because I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201331\">didn't see myself growing in the position. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">And I knew that there was potential for growth I just wasn't sure how to correctly voice this and assert myself, get myself out there. And so that was, you know, one of the reasons I had started going to see this person. And somewhere along the line it moved from that onto my problems with procrastination <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201351\">and she was giving me homework assignments to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">And I always thought that was a little funny that she's giving me stuff to do that I think she kind of knew, she must've known, wasn't going to get done. (laughs) So eventually, after I think a month and a half, I ended that because I saw it was just going nowhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: You know what came to mind? Your parents with volleyball kind of setting you up for failure. You know, \"You're here for procrastination? Here's some homework.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah. That's kind of (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013D\">THERAPIST: Like not only missing the point -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2013E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2013F\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20140\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20141\">THERAPIST: but kind of, from [my eye] (ph) it seems similar in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20142\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20143\">CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I thought about that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20144\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20145\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20146\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20147\">CLIENT: I've thought about that. And at times I've also thought about what you just said about my parents sort of setting me up for failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20149\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014B\">CLIENT: You know, my parents like having a certain level of control my sister and myself. And I think they don't like the fact that I sort of broke free of all that and my sister is still living at home. As is her boyfriend. He's a little older than her and he still lives at home as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014D\">THERAPIST: Not in your parent's home, in his own home?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2014E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2014F\">CLIENT: Not in my parents, in his own home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20150\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20151\">THERAPIST: Well, not really in his own home but his parents' home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20152\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20153\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20154\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20155\">THERAPIST: At some point it's no longer your home, I think it's your parents' home.

And how proud they are but, you know, part of me knows that they sort of resent the fact that they don't have that grip that they used to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20161\">THERAPIST: Hm. That's sort of an odd way of putting. But like with having your sister never leave, which you imagine I mean she's contributing to too because she could leave, but they're certainly contributing to that dynamic. What's in it for them? Why do they Do you have a sense of why they want <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201611\">that control? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20163\">CLIENT: I don't. You know, actually I had this conversation with my aunt once when I came out to my aunt, who is also my godmother, before I came out to my parents because I came out to them at her house, [what I consider] (ph), and my parents are still upset about, at both me and my aunt, that I <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201631\">did it there. But to me that was a safe environment because I knew how they'd react.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20162-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20162-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559554\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: My aunt and I talked about the fact that my grandparents were not very strict on my mother and my other aunt, and how both my mother and my other aunt are a bit more controlling and demanding of their children than she is of her children who my grandparents were very strict on because she was <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201671\">the oldest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016B\">CLIENT: And I don't know what my parents get out of wanting that control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2016E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F\">CLIENT: But it's one of the things that sort of made me move up here after graduating high school to go to college. And that on top of the fact that I knew I'd never be able to You know, I always knew I was little different (laughs) throughout high school. And I knew I would never be able to go out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2016F1\">and expand or get new experiences to find out why I'm different if I was still living at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20171\">THERAPIST: Mm. Different in terms of?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20173\">CLIENT: Different in terms of my sexuality and my interests. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20175\">THERAPIST: Mm. One thing that reminded me when you were talking about your parents, wanting them to exert control. That is something, I'm not saying it's the same kind of control, something that came up between you and Liam. That Liam felt that in your relationship, and you felt also, that you wanted <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201751\">to, you know, control him but, you know, somehow keep him close.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20177\">CLIENT: Yes. And for me it was more of a fear of just feeling I wasn't doing something right or doing enough. And fearing that if, you know, I let him I wouldn't say that I \"let him\" go out because I wouldn't say that I ever said, \"No, you can't go out.\" Fearing that if he wasn't with me he'd be out <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201771\">there finding someone else or something. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20179\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017B\">CLIENT: If that makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017D\">THERAPIST: That's a big fear. That requires a lot of effort. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2017F\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think a lot of it was spurred by our own just We, I think I previously said we had our intimate tendencies but a lack of actual lovemaking. I always, you know, we talked about it a couple of times and, you know, the way he brushed it off at times just left me not feeling extremely secure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20181\">And that's why I was always just a little worried or afraid that well maybe, what if there's someone else out there that, you know, maybe I'm missing something. Or, you know, it's something he's just not interested in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20183\">THERAPIST: So you took it as a rejection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20185\">CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's why it might have come off at times as a little control though. I wouldn't put it as control over him versus so much as control over certain situations. And that's why I -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20187\">THERAPIST: Mm. That's an important distinction. Because that seemed to the emphasis when you guys were talking and the two of you were here, that there were particular situations that made you feel anxious. And you needed information to feel like, \"Okay, this is okay.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20189\">CLIENT: Yeah. And, you know, there were times where we would talk about something over the phone, I would get a little sad, and then I would hang up the phone. And, you know, after we were done I would be like, \"Gee, why did I ? Yeah, that's not so bad is it?\" And, you know, if (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B\">I mean part of it was also a little frustration that I don't think he always took He was easily excited about one thing, you know, the current thing at times. And granted I'll admit I'm easily excitable too. But, you know, what he had mentioned about back in February, whenever we had the storm. Because <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2018B1\">I remember this happened right before the storm because his friend couldn't fly out on Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P7-N2018A-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"6\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2018A-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":8,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2559554\" data-realpage=\"8\" data-page=\"8\">\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">You know, I got out of work and I called him to let him know I'm on my way. And, you know, it's a Wednesday night which he knows that I have something to do for Wednesday night for my class. And he says, \"I'm trying to, you know, get this to work out.\" You know, a friend is in town. And we were trying <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D1\">to, you know, all get together for dinner. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">And, you know, I pointed out to him that, you know, \"I've got class work to do tonight. I can't. Tonight doesn't work.\" You know? And I'm sure I did not say it as calmly. And, you know, I said, \"Tomorrow could work but I know you have class until 6:45, so it would have to be later.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">And, you know, at the moment I felt like he was trying to make these plans but he's not taking both of our schedules into account. (laughs) And so I reacted instinctively on that. That, \"Gee.\" You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">And after a few moments I realized, I think I said that I could figure something if it really had to be tonight. You know, I could try and work on my stuff afterwards. It would be kind of late, but I could try and work on my stuff afterwards. You know? But it was after that initial moment like, \"Oh, <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201931\">gee, this isn't the right way to respond to this.\" <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. Well, Benjamin, we're going to need to stop for today. You know, it's a shift going from being with a couple to being individually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">THERAPIST: What was that like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">CLIENT: It was good. It wasn't as awkward as I thought it would be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">CLIENT: Apparently not as awkward as he thought it would be either. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">CLIENT: No, we both had a good time. We had to talk about a couple of practical things and, you know, I mean fears about the whole situation is the condo and my living situation. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">CLIENT: And we set up a temporary solution that, you know, he's going to continue with his half and we will reevaluate things in October. Because he recognizes for me, you know, suddenly as half the income disappears I'm not in the financial position to, you know, move and we could rent it. And we shouldn't <\/span><span data-id=\"P8-N201A71\">sell it right now either because we just wouldn't make our money back yet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">CLIENT: But aside from the couple of practical things we had to talk about, it was a good time. We were both really glad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">THERAPIST: Alright. Good. Okay, very well.
