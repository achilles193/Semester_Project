No, no, I don't mean to be insulting.

Not prefer mornings?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: No, it's not I didn't prefer mornings.

It takes a lot of time when you're living by yourself and not living with family. You have to clean up after yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">THERAPIST: It's an adjustment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">CLIENT: Yeah, no, it's a good adjustment to be independent, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">(Pause): [00:15:43 00:16:30]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">CLIENT: I remember from last time we talked about -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20047\">(Pause): [00:16:33 00:17:22]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20049\">CLIENT: I don't remember.

What is the reason?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20076\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20077\">THERAPIST: I'm not sure. I can make a lot of conjectures.

I was more curious about it. But that in terms of the (unclear) schedule, but that being said, this maybe will open up an important topic. You know, in relationships <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2007B1\">in general people can be upset with each other. That's what happens in relationships. You can't please someone all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007D\">CLIENT: Yeah, I guess.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2007F\">(Pause): [00:19:50 00:20:11]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20081\">CLIENT: I don't know why that made me think of weird things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20083\">(Pause): [00:20:13 00:20:19]<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20085\">CLIENT: I was doing fine.
