(long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2000E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F\">CLIENT: I guess I\u2019m just getting pretty out of it and kind of tired. I don\u2019t know. Yesterday, I don\u2019t know if it was allergies or something, but I just kind of seemed hazy and [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:59).  It\u2019s hard to do work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that I don\u2019t like being tired so I try to fight it <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F1\">or try to do something about it. I get angry when I feel that way. (long pause)  When I left here yesterday I was feeling kind of heavy and not able to express exactly what was wrong.  (pause) I don\u2019t know if it was feeling like shame for not using my time better here or a general feeling of not knowing <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2000F2\">what I want or feeling aimless, I guess.  (long pause)  I\u2019m just trying to think of what my thought process was yesterday. (pause) It was just kind of a general dread. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20010\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20011\">THERAPIST: When you say \u201cgeneral dread,\u201d what do you have in mind?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20012\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20013\">CLIENT: It was like yesterday at work I was feeling bad about not using my time well and then just going to work and being out of it, tired, not really wanting to do anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20014\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20015\">THERAPIST: And in what way did you feel you didn\u2019t use your time well? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">CLIENT: Because I just felt like I didn\u2019t have anything to say or was being very stubborn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">THERAPIST: Were you being stubborn?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">CLIENT: I don\u2019t know. Just not wanting to discuss things or just kind of wanting to stay productive or keep my emotions in check.  (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">THERAPIST: I see. And you were pretty mad at yourself over it. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">CLIENT: I guess. I think I just want change and I feel like I\u2019m being stubborn or kind of not allowing that or [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:11). (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: I think you might be protecting yourself from feeling more vulnerable and [ ] (inaudible at 00:13:52) by the minute by being more self-critical. It can be one of those instances where you\u2019re feeling self-critical, as though you\u2019re being stubborn; you\u2019re resisting this or resisting me or resisting <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200211\">talking about things that you\u2019re feeling when you should be able to be more in control of yourself and more in control of opening up in those ways or going with things, I guess.  It seems to me that\u2019s something like what you have in mind. And that feels crummy, to be critical or angry at yourself for <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200212\">that, I think, but probably quite a lot safer than being in touch with how scary all that is, I think, for you \u2013 how unpredictable, how dangerous, in that it can really throw you, and how that can throw a dent in your day.  Wanting to get things done, it can then make you really feel bad. I guess what <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200213\">I have in mind is, though I know it doesn\u2019t feel good, maybe feeling so self-critical of yourself is also more comfortable because it means that you should be in control of it, rather than being in touch with how frightening it is to [tend to] (ph?) the things about what you feel or what upsets you <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200214\">or whatever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: Right. At the time, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m upset. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: I think I know what you mean. I guess I\u2019m not sure how you mean that in response to what I said. In other words, I think there is probably a connection there that I\u2019m not getting. <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20024-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20024-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562438\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20027\">CLIENT: I agree with what you\u2019re saying, but I guess it just seems like I\u2019m not able to talk about it or understand it. I don\u2019t want to deal with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20029\">THERAPIST: I see. So it\u2019s not as though there is this very clear story of things you\u2019re upset about or have strong feelings about that you\u2019re kind of not wanting to talk about.  It\u2019s more like you can feel like you\u2019re being stubborn or not wanting to deal with things, but it\u2019s unclear, if you turn around <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200291\">and look that way, what you\u2019re even referring to or what you would be talking about or why it would be upsetting \u2013 stuff like that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002B\">CLIENT: Right. Yeah. (long pause)  It kind of feels like everything bothers me and I don\u2019t know what to do about it or how to make it better or why I just can\u2019t let things be or enjoy things. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002D\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s very overwhelming, I gather, to try to think about what\u2019s bothering you and why because you said it seems like everything and, at times, for no real clear reason. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F\">CLIENT: Right.  (long pause)  I don\u2019t know. It comes down to every second I\u2019m just not wanting to do something or being critical of myself, thinking about work and not wanting to do these things or being mad that I have to do something or just whatever pops up. And then there is a general feeling like <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2002F1\">why am I so tired? I\u2019m just feeling sluggish or feeling the way I feel or why can\u2019t I feel better? Or why can\u2019t I just have energy? I don\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s everything. Everything that pops up in my head, I just don\u2019t want to.t deal with it.  Why is it this way or what can I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20031\">THERAPIST: It\u2019s as though you\u2019re kind of in a fight all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20033\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20035\">THERAPIST: You say it\u2019s always a fight to do things, like you\u2019re always pushing against something, no matter how much you know you need to get done or, I guess in a way, even don\u2019t mind doing it, it\u2019s like you\u2019re always having to struggle with something to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20037\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20039\">THERAPIST: I guess I\u2019m sort of thinking it has three parts. One part wants to do whatever it is or feels like it needs to get done.  Another part, which seems, for whatever reason, to be directly opposing your doing that. And then the third part that seems helpless to do anything about all of that, <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200391\">that\u2019s almost passively watching and confused and sort of helpless, or kind of unable to understand, to make it better to work or compromise or something like that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B\">CLIENT: Right.  (long pause)  I wish I could think of what it feels like, but it\u2019s just kind of being outraged or always unhappy with the situation \u2013 I guess it\u2019s with myself \u2013 but then feeling unable to do anything or helpless.  The outrage wants to do something \u2013 be critical or punish or something <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003B1\">\u2013 to make the situation better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D\">THERAPIST: I guess the way that often works, I think, is that there is a part of you that wants to talk or try to get into stuff, even if you\u2019re not sure quite how or what to say. There is another part that is sort of angry and pushing back on that and doesn\u2019t want to, and then you feel sort of helpless <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D1\">about it. But I think you also \u2013 I also get some of the helpless part. I\u2019m sitting here watching and can\u2019t really do anything, but it would be good if I could do something to help make that easier.  There might be other moments where I think you feel like I\u2019m also the one who thinks you should be doing <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2003D2\">something and you\u2019re pushing back on me. My sense is that sort of [flickers] (ph?) sometime.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2003C-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2562438\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2003F\">CLIENT: I think it\u2019s just easier for me to just contain it, like contain the helplessness or the anger feeling by just being productive. I just don\u2019t want to deal with either one. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20041\">THERAPIST: Here or elsewhere that\u2019s part of what can be both satisfying and reassuring about being productive, is that it helps to contain that anger and overcome the helplessness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20043\">CLIENT: Right. (long pause)  So . . . I don\u2019t know. I guess I just keep trying to function or function at a productive level, but then if I get thrown out or anything like that, I get really angry [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:33) I might be slightly removed or [ ] able to function more and do things.  (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20045\">THERAPIST: I\u2019m not clear on the last part. I get the first part about how [being productive] (ph?) helps, but then if you get thrown out you get really angry because the [anger shouldn\u2019t be placated in the] (ph?) same way anymore. I see. So you\u2019re saying after you get angry, then sometimes you feel <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200451\">kind of removed or a little out of it and that sort of gets you back to being able to do things?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20047\">CLIENT: No.  Being productive, I\u2019m [removed.] (ph?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20049\">THERAPIST: Oh, I see. It\u2019s being productive that keeps you a bit removed. I see.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004B\">CLIENT: Right. To separate or I don\u2019t want to be influenced by people or off-put by people or [ ] (inaudible at 00:39:32) unconsciously, but it seems like I care less about things and try not to be deflected by them. (long pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D\">THERAPIST: I was thinking I wonder where all the anger comes from, what or whom you\u2019re so angry at. I know that so much of the time you\u2019re taking it out on yourself, so you\u2019re kind of evidently angry at yourself. But I sort of get the feeling that\u2019s not where it starts or that that\u2019s only part of the <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D1\">story, if that makes sense. That makes me wonder then what\u2019s the rest of the story?  I\u2019m not sure, but one thought I have and that I\u2019ve had before is that when you feel a demand to do something, I think it feels very big and very intrusive. Like if there is something that you have to do at work, let\u2019s <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D2\">say \u2013 something that Ray wants or even if Marlowe asks you for something, it feels like the request is made with a lot of authority, I think, and a lot of insistence at some level.  I know you can recognize when, in reality, Ray or Marlowe or whoever might be more urgent or more casual about what they\u2019re <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N2004D3\">asking. I don\u2019t think you necessarily mix that up, but I think there is some way internally that it might feel very intense, like a very intense demand and very intrusive, like a demand that isn\u2019t made from outside, but from inside, in some way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2004F\">CLIENT: Right. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20051\">THERAPIST: My thought is maybe that\u2019s part of what makes you mad. We should actually stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20053\">END TRANSCRIPT<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>"}]}
