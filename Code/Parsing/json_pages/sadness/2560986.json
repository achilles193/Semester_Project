(laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20016\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20017\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20018\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20019\">CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:04:53) (sigh) (pause) (sigh) I was thinking about what you said last time about having weird categories. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001B\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D\">CLIENT: Yeah I think it makes sense. I should think about that more. Yes, even specifically, you know, people who I said, you know last time I said, you know, oppress me. (laughs) Because they seem to have everything or, you know, they have their act together, or they seem more purposeful or more intelligent. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2001D1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2001E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2001F\">Are you implying that I should see them more as just people instead of all these, you know, things that I have or don't have? That's my perception, I think, of them. They have x, y, z. Or they don't have x, y, z. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20020\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20021\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20022\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20023\">CLIENT: So instead of that should I see them as people?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20024\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20025\">THERAPIST: It wasn't prescriptive. I wasn't saying you see them this way and you should see them this way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20026\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20027\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20028\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20029\">THERAPIST: I was really just sort of wanting to draw your attention to how you see them and have us think about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002D\">THERAPIST: So it was less about how you should be seeing them differently. (pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2002E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2002F\">CLIENT: I found something, you're right, that I bring like my Dad's judgment -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20030\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20031\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20032\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20033\">CLIENT: along. Why is this? It's so weird to me because, you know, I really know, like I know he, all of his, you know, bad qualities. You know, I have like, you know, I hate him and I know he's messed up. (laughs) So why, despite knowing that and feeling that, why do I still carry stuff that he said <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200331\">with me. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20034\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20035\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20036\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20037\">CLIENT: Shouldn't my hatred just filter everything from him?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20038\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20039\">THERAPIST: Well, I don't think hatred has that ability. And also that assumes that the only thing you feel toward him is hatred. Which is not true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003A\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B\">CLIENT: That's true. Yeah. (sigh) (pause) I guess I'm trying to understand this piece. And it is, I mean it is confusing and I'm sure it's confusing for everyone. Maybe not for everyone, maybe for everyone. (laughs) I don't know. I just think I straddle a lot of different circles and societies and cultures. <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003B1\">And, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003C\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N2003E\"><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F\">CLIENT: I feel that I do. But maybe you do too. Maybe everyone does every day. I guess they do. But for my undergrad I went to a state college. And then after that, you know, in [January I was at] (ph) MBU. And now, again, back to the state university. So I feel like I've seen people from very different <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N2003F1\">economic backgrounds. And I feel like that has confused me as to not simply how to, what to think about them, but who I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20040\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20041\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20042\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20043\">CLIENT: Because I get so easily influenced because I think, you know, \"I'm under construction,\" or whatever. \"I could be like this person. I could be like that person.\" You know? Instead of thinking, \"I'm me and this is who I am and I'm quite comfortable in my own skin.\" I feel like, you know, that <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200431\">is the normal way of being. (laughs) And I want to get there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P1-N20044\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20045\">But I feel like, yeah, I definitely have looked at other people I admire and have thought, \"I want to be like them.\" You know? (laughs) (pause) I don't know why I do that. (laughs) And I feel like no one else does that or people don't need to do that. They are quite steady in who they are. You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P1-N200451\">they don't get swayed or swept off their feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P1-N20044-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"0\"><span data-id=\"P1-N20044-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":2,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560986\" data-realpage=\"2\" data-page=\"2\">\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20046\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20047\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20048\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20049\">CLIENT: (laughs) (pause) But yeah, like at BC there is such a diverse set of people and some of the people, really, they just baffle me. Like the way that they, their struggles and stuff. Like there are people who have like two hour commutes and God knows where (inaudible at 00:10:53) how they get there. <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200491\">I guess they drive and, you know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B\">And one of my classmates she has MS and she, you know, she can't drive. So she rides some commuter train and, you know, it takes her two hours, you know, each way. And this other person I was talking to, she works at a coffee shop. And she said she had woken up at four in the morning. And we were going <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2004B1\">back on the bus and it was like, you know, ten. (laughs) And I was like, \"Oh, I'm so tired. You know, it's been a long day.\" (laughs) She says, \"I got up at four.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" I don't even have the right to complain anymore. (laughs) You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004D\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2004E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2004F\">CLIENT: I mean I know it's all relative and all, but it's just like I feel, you know, humbled by it. But then, you know, I get off the train and I'm in the Square. (laughs) And them I'm like, \"This is so confusing.\" (laughs) You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20050\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20051\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20052\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20053\">CLIENT: For me it is. (long pause) Yeah, I feel like there's a core and that shouldn't change no matter what. But I don't know what to put inside the core. (sniffing sounds) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20054\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20055\">(long pause)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20056\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20057\">CLIENT: So if I look at people differently, how would that help me? What would be a scenario? What would it look like? (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20058\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20059\">THERAPIST: Well, I guess, for starters you'd feel less oppressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005B\">CLIENT: (laughs) (pause) Nah. I don't think so. (laughs) I can see, you know, picture their faces and I come walking into their home and then walk right out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005D\">THERAPIST: I'm not sure Can you describe that again for me? That image?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2005E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F\">CLIENT: No, you say I may feel less oppressed. So I was like, \"Okay, I'm going to walk into these people houses.\" And then, you know, they're sitting there and all this stuff in my head, you know, judgments and like, you know, \"Yeah, no I feel oppressed.\" And I would just say, \"No, thank you,\" and then <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N2005F1\">just walk away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20060\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20061\">THERAPIST: Mm hm. What do you think the connection to an oppression and walking into their homes? That's so interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20062\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20063\">CLIENT: I don't know. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20064\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20065\">THERAPIST: That you'd walk into the home of someone whom you might feel oppressed by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20066\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20067\">CLIENT: Well, I don't know if there is a connection. I just You know, because I was saying, you know, what would that look like. So, you know, I was already imagining going to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20068\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20069\">THERAPIST: I see. So I guess when I think about oppressing I think about someone coming to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006A\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006B\">CLIENT: Ahhh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006C\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006D\">THERAPIST: Not you going to them. So that's -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N2006E\"><span data-id=\"P2-N2006F\">CLIENT: But I don't have a place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20070\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20071\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P2-N20072\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20073\">CLIENT: It's Chris's place that I've done up and that I cook in. They have come, actually it's been they who have come. But I just kind of sit awkwardly and, you know, they ask questions and I either don't reply or change the subject or ask them if they would like more food. (laughs) And then just kind <\/span><span data-id=\"P2-N200731\">of flutter away. (laughs) (sigh) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P2-N20072-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"1\"><span data-id=\"P2-N20072-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":3,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560986\" data-realpage=\"3\" data-page=\"3\">\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20074\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20075\">THERAPIST: But that is so interesting.

They try to run away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007B\">CLIENT: Well, but they're my friends and I like them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007D\">THERAPIST: Well, that's (laughs) That's so -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2007E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2007F\">CLIENT: Which isn't to say that they don't oppress me. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20080\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20081\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20082\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20083\">CLIENT: No, I completely respect them and I like them and, you know, objectively I like spending time with them. (laughs) But because we were hanging out together, you know, Chris and I with them and, you know, I'm invited. But then it's, yeah, after a while I feel, depending on, I guess, other things, <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200831\">depending on how secure or insecure I feel that week or that day. (laughs) You know, that will determine the number of minutes I spend engaging with them. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20084\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20085\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20086\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20087\">CLIENT: So (pause) And I know a lot people don't have the issues I have. And I see that and I see that their interaction is so much more calm and maybe even fruitful and meaningful. Definitely fruitful and meaningful. I mean people who are successful right now, I mean from my batch from [my new school <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200871\">or] (ph) whatever, they don't have the psychological issues I have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20088\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20089\">So it seems like they have smoother interactions and they get to where they want to go. I just feel like I have so many hang ups. (laughs) It's just like I just get hung up. But, unfortunately, I've been hung up for years, and so that is not at all good. You know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008B\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2008C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2008D\">CLIENT: So it just prolongs my misery and uselessness.

You don't go up and call your professor \"professor\" but you refer to them as, you know, with his first name. But I've always only called <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200911\">professors \"professor.\" And, you know, there's the hierarchy that's set in my head. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20092\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20093\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20094\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20095\">CLIENT: It's been like level ground has not been, yeah, it's not there. (pause) I don't know. Like will I just automatically feel less insecure? Just one day later just snap and I'm sitting all by myself and suddenly I'll feel less insecure? (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20096\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20097\">THERAPIST: Hm. Hopefully that's something we're working towards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N20098\"><span data-id=\"P3-N20099\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009A\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009B\">THERAPIST: Is it hard to imagine feeling that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009C\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009D\">CLIENT: Well I feel like maybe if it's people that oppress me, it's going to have to be, you know, repeated interactions where I've trained myself not to feel oppressed. (laughs) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N2009E\"><span data-id=\"P3-N2009F\">THERAPIST: Mm. (pause) I guess that's one way to look at it. I think about it as understanding the meaning of your oppression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A1\">CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don't know what it means. (laughs) (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A3\">THERAPIST: And both your parents, in their own ways, felt very oppressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A4\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A5\">CLIENT: Hm. Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A6\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A7\">THERAPIST: And I sense that was, it was almost the air you breathed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200A8\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200A9\">CLIENT: Yeah. Probably. I mean, there were moments, but I guess they were really the exceptions.

Everything has to be this big thing, that I make it out to be such a big thing, there's like all this baggage. (laughs) It's tiring to carry that around. You know? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200AE\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200AF\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P3-N200B0\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B1\">CLIENT: But Chris is going to Cambridge this weekend to work on a paper with his colleague. And he knows me and his wife knows me and, you know, we've hung out a couple, a few times. So they bought a house and they were like, \"Yeah, you should come too.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, sure.\" (laughs) (sniffs) <\/span><span data-id=\"P3-N200B11\">But I'm not going to go. And I'm just thinking that's what I had in mind, like walking into their house.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P3-N200B0-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"2\"><span data-id=\"P3-N200B0-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":4,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560986\" data-realpage=\"4\" data-page=\"4\">\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B3\">And it's like I mean I get it objectively. I see that they have struggled too, and they were also poor students once and, you know. So like when I was in Nepal the wife was there too. (sniffs) And I was all in India when that thing happened with that old guy. And I was all alone and sitting in that <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B31\">room and I e-mailed a couple of people and his wife was one of them. She was far away in Istanbul. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B5\">But she replied and she's not really warm. She's, you know, an academic. She's a historian so she is very, she's a little cerebral. But she's, you know, she's okay. She's, you know, congenial. So she wrote back and said, \"Yeah, this is how it is Nepal. And I'm also doing my own research.\" You know, <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B51\">\"I'm walking around the city and, you know, for the past week this man has just following me everywhere. And he thinks I'm a hooker so, you know, he just approached me and solicited me. And I was so disgusted by that.\" And this and that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B7\">And you know, \"Yeah, but if you feel unsafe let me know. I have family in India,\" and this and that. \"You can stay with them.\" It just felt weird. I have her e-mail because, I mean, I can see that response. Like I can understand it, you know, that when someone says, \"Oh, something, something happened <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200B71\">to me.\" My response is to say, \"Yeah, you know, the same thing happened to me, so you're not alone,\" and, you know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200B8\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200B9\">But sometimes you want them to (laughs), you know. Another response could be, \"Oh, how horrible.\" You know? \"I'm so sorry.\" You know? \"Are you okay?\" And, you know, \"I feel bad for you.\" (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BB\">THERAPIST: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200BC\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200BD\">CLIENT: You know what I mean?

I just was like, \"What do you know? You have family all over,\" and like you just said. I have no I just had that acute sense of loneliness there because I was just, I was by myself. You know? People downstairs were, you know, acting weird <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200C11\">and all that. But I just felt like, \"Why don't I have any family? Why don't have a place? I have nothing.\" You know, and all that. All those negative thoughts. (sigh) (pause) So. (pause) <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C2\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C3\">That's what I feel like when I think of security and not feeling oppressed, and feeling everyone is equal. I feel like I want to have a place in my head, in my mind, where I can go and feel secure or feel like it's a bastion or something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C4\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C5\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200C6\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200C7\">CLIENT: But I feel like I don't have that.

What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P4-N200CA\"><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB\">CLIENT: I don't know. Like when I see her, you know, walking about and confused and, you know, there's like a pile of, you know, stuff around that she hasn't cleaned up and she hasn't organized. (laughs) I mean, she takes care of herself and all, but I just see it as someone I shouldn't, I can't lean <\/span><span data-id=\"P4-N200CB1\">on. You know? Maybe I can but I just don't think of her that way.

(pause) How do I change that though? (laughs) It's my perception. (pause) It wasn't just that she had family and I didn't.

But then, you know, I feel like maybe I can battle this or counter this with just objective truth that the reason why I don't have family is because A, you know, my Mom has cut off all ties with <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N201171\">my Dad's family. B, you know, they're all scattered and they're either in the US or they're scattered and we're not in touch with them. So. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20118\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20119\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011B\">CLIENT: And this is a result of certain things that have happened that I had absolutely no say in. So, hence -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011D\">THERAPIST: Mm hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2011E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F\">CLIENT: (laughs) I find myself not having much family in Nepal. And that I should appreciate (laughs) that it isn't too indulgent or that I still want to go to the country. And I take such interest in it and I want to write about it, despite the fact that it's hard for me. You know, it's harder for <\/span><span data-id=\"P6-N2011F1\">me than it is for, you know, people like her who can just, you know, buy a ticket and don't have to worry about where to stay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20120\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20121\">Although, she did too because she wanted to do research in Istanbul and she didn't have family in Istanbul.

Like she was in a hostel and she, you know, had this experience. And I was in a nice comfortable home (laughs) and I also had a weird experience. (pause) So. (pause) I don't know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20126\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20127\">THERAPIST: I mean there's certainly truth to what you think that, I guess if you're in a comparison mode, there are a lot of things you didn't get that other people get. That's absolutely true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20128\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20129\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012A\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012B\">THERAPIST: And there are ways, there's treatment that you suffered that other people didn't have to suffer. And your parents had grave limitation. And so that's all true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012C\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N2012E\"><span data-id=\"P6-N2012F\">THERAPIST: You're not making that up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20130\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20131\">CLIENT: So this should make me feel what? It should liberate me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20132\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20133\">THERAPIST: Hm. It's interesting. This is something that you do. So wanting something prescriptive in what I say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20134\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20135\">CLIENT: No, it's not that. Because I already said this, right? That, you know, there are some objective truths that I should look at and say, \"Well, I cannot change this.\" You know? \"I had no say in it and I'm never going to have,\" whatever. Because, you know, it's in the past and I cannot change it, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20136\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20137\">So this should liberate me in the sense that, \"Okay, you know, that's taken care of.

So let's worry about something that I actually can change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P6-N20138\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20139\">THERAPIST: Well, that is a liberating thought. The complexity to it, as you've pointed out just at the beginning of the session with the association with your Dad, is that it's not only the past, it lives inside you in the present.<\/span><\/p>\n<span data-id=\"P6-N20138-br\" class=\"page-break\" data-seq=\"5\"><span data-id=\"P6-N20138-dsp\"><\/span><\/span>\n<\/div>"},{"number":7,"html":"<div class=\"page text-page\" data-objectid=\"bibliographic_entity|bibliographic_details|2560986\" data-realpage=\"7\" data-page=\"7\">\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013B\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2013C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2013D\">THERAPIST: The events happened in the past, but they've been internalize in a particular way in that they are sort of still living and breathing inside of you.

And it doesn't even have to be academics. Like it was actually happening with this, you know, this Friday guy. (laughs) Like he took me to his friend's place and we were just hanging out. And, you know, that's when I was, I think in that previous <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201471\">session, I was like, \"Yeah, these guys are not intellectuals.\" And you're like, \"Wait a second. Your categories are weird.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20148\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20149\">THERAPIST: I did not use the word \"weird.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2014A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2014B\">CLIENT: I'm just summarizing.

I'm not saying that -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20158\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20159\">THERAPIST: No, I'm just trying to point that already a process takes place where you're taking in what I'm saying in a particular way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015A\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B\">CLIENT: Yeah. But this is helpful though, because in the sense that I very much appreciate and I find it useful that you said, \"Your categories are \" You know, you pointed out that I should think about them. So that's my idea that I'm feeling, not quite right, but they're problematic. But so, you <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N2015B1\">know, I was just there and, you know, sensing that, you know, yeah, I'm a poor struggling artist. And, you know, these guys are corporate and they have, I don't even know how much them make. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015C\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015D\">But apparently they have What do they call it? Trainers or At the gym. Like you have -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N2015E\"><span data-id=\"P7-N2015F\">THERAPIST: Personal trainer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20160\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20161\">CLIENT: Yeah. Like they pay them three hundred dollars a month. And, you know, that's like, yeah, that's half my rent. (laughs) So, you know, I have that and there are all these stimuli coming at me where, you know, there's like, you know, learning that their parents fly first class or whatever. All <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201611\">these are coming at me and I'm like, \"Oh my gosh.\" And I feel completely bombarded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20162\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20163\">And what is my defense? My defense is to say, \"Okay, they're not intellectual.\" I look at them and they're watching and they're watching some really silly movie. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20164\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20165\">THERAPIST: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20166\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20167\">CLIENT: And, you know, people their age who are intellectuals would be watching, you know, Godard. Or, you know, they would know so much more about the history of cinema and, you know, like genres and directors and, you know. (laughs) So that's my defense. And then, you know, another defense is to say, <\/span><span data-id=\"P7-N201671\">\"You know, I cannot measure up.\" And, you know, and then my baggage comes in. And, you know, like, \"I didn't have this. I didn't have that. My Dad was this.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P7-N20168\"><span data-id=\"P7-N20169\">But I use that as a defense.

You know? And it's not even a good defense. It, in fact, weakens me. It's actually the sort of defense, it's putting on a jacket, which is the opposite of a bulletproof jacket.

Well, when you describe that particular sequence, it started by your feeling like an outsider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20170\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20171\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20172\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20173\">THERAPIST: And then it sort of goes to your feeling now even more like an outsider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20174\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20175\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20176\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20177\">THERAPIST: Because you start by feeling like an outsider to sort of this, you know, rich world of riches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20178\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20179\">CLIENT: Mm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017B\">THERAPIST: And then your mind goes to ways in which they're an outsider. They're an outsider to an intellectual culture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017D\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2017E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2017F\">THERAPIST: They're on the fringes of that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20180\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20181\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20182\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20183\">THERAPIST: And then it kind of goes from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20184\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20185\">CLIENT: Yeah. So it's really like a power play and, you know, it's happening obviously very quickly. And what are we doing? We're drinking together and I'm playing their music and their playing a silly movie. And they're not even thinking any of this (laughs) obviously. You know. So.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20186\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20187\">THERAPIST: Well, what's especially interesting is that these are not people that you're seeing from across a restaurant. This is you're with them because of someone that you're dating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20188\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20189\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018B\">THERAPIST: So you're already being brought in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018D\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2018E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2018F\">THERAPIST: It's not like you're You're far from an outsider from that vantage point because he wants you and he's bringing you into his world. It's not someone that you're observing, you know, across a room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20190\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20191\">CLIENT: Hm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20192\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20193\">THERAPIST: Or in a movie. But that doesn't give you comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20194\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20195\">CLIENT: Is it supposed to give me comfort?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20196\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20197\">THERAPIST: Coulda, woulda, shoulda. (laughs) I don't know if it's supposed to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N20198\"><span data-id=\"P8-N20199\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019A\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019B\">THERAPIST: But do you see what I'm saying?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019C\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019D\">CLIENT: No.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N2019E\"><span data-id=\"P8-N2019F\">THERAPIST: You're already, at the onset of this, by definition, not an outsider in important ways, because you're being brought in by someone who wants you and is interested in you. You're not there because some friend tells you to come along somewhere, that you're tagging along with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A1\">CLIENT: Really? That's what I thought I was.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A3\">THERAPIST: Well, that's interesting. Right? Even as I said that I was thinking, \"You probably think that way.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A5\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A7\">THERAPIST: So what is your theory as to why this guy who still has no name, by the way -<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201A8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201A9\">CLIENT: (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AB\">THERAPIST: Are you a tagalong to him? Why is he bringing you in? <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AD\">CLIENT: He's invited me to his friend's parties. This is the first time I had gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201AE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201AF\">THERAPIST: But then what are you to him? You're not sort of You didn't bump into him randomly. You have a relationship with him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B1\">CLIENT: Yeah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B3\">THERAPIST: So I'm saying, by definition, that's not being an outsider because the two of you are connected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B5\">CLIENT: That's true.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B7\">THERAPIST: You're not someone who just wandered off the street and he's like, \"Oh, come to this party with me.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201B8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201B9\">CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I feel that way. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BA\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BB\">THERAPIST: I know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BC\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BD\">CLIENT: I feel that way with Chris too, actually. So, I guess, that is a big can of worms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201BE\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201BF\">THERAPIST: But these men want you and they want to be with you. And that's not being an outsider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C0\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C1\">CLIENT: Why? I have no idea why they want to be with me. (laughs)<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C2\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C3\">THERAPIST: Maybe that because it's hard for you wrap your mind around it, you just push away that knowledge that they do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C4\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C5\">CLIENT: Yeah. It's very scary. Yeah. <\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C6\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C7\">THERAPIST: Scary to feel that they want you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-id=\"P8-N201C8\"><span data-id=\"P8-N201C9\">CLIENT: Yeah.
